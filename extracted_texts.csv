RE: Docket Number EPA-R03-RCRA-2008-0256
Dear Mr. UyBarreta:
Please accept my comments opposing EPA’s authorization of revisions to Virginia’s hazardous 
waste regulations, specifically those rules that were promulgated and adopted under non-HSWA 
authority.  This includes, but is not limited to, the RCRA Burden Reduction Initiative (Revision 
Checklist 213).  Under federal statute, none of the states are allowed to adopt “requirements less 
stringent” than those that had been adopted “upon the effective date of regulations under this 
subchapter.”1  Creating the language found at 42 USC 6929, Congress assured that the standards 
set under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended by HSWA, would 
be the “minimum standard” adopted by the states, and that subsequent regulations at the state 
level would not fall below this standard.  It would seem logical that if Congress did not intend 
for states to adopt standards less stringent than these original rules -- and has in fact barred states 
from doing so -- that Congress did not intend, and therefore has also barred, EPA from 
promulgating them.  
Many of the rules adopted by Virginia are less stringent than those they replace; a fact that does 
not appear to be supported by federal statute.  
It is clear from the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to 42 USC 6929 that Congress 
was concerned that EPA might undermine the RCRA and HSWA through regulation,
specifically with regard to manifest notification2. The RCRA Burden Reduction Initiative – all 
of which is promulgated pursuant to non-HSWA authority – removes the (manifest) requirement 
(40 CFR 268.7(b)(6)) that notification be sent to the state with each shipment of waste-derived 
 
 
1 42 USC 6929 “Upon the effective date of regulations under this subchapter no State or political 
subdivision may impose any requirements less stringent than those authorized under this 
subchapter respecting the same matter as governed by such regulations… Nothing in this 
chapter shall be construed to prohibit any State or political subdivision thereof from imposing 
any requirements, including those for site selection, which are more stringent than those 
imposed by such regulations.”
2 1984—Pub. L. 98–616 inserted “Nothing in this chapter (or in any regulation adopted under this 
chapter) shall be construed to prohibit any State from requiring that the State be provided with 
a copy of each manifest used in connection with hazardous waste which is generated within 
that State or transported to a treatment, storage, or disposal facility within that state.

product shipped into and within a state.  Not only can the rule be “construed (as) to prohibit a 
State from requiring that the State be provided with a copy of each manifest”, it does prohibit a 
State from requiring a manifest when adopted – an act clearly prohibited.
Virginia is seeking authorization for nine RCRA clusters which include several non-HSWA 
rules.  Some of the Revision Checklists erroneously suggest that the Attorney General may not 
need to conduct a detailed review of the proposed rules against state statute for authority prior to 
final authorization.  However, under the requirements of 40 CFR 271.7 the Attorney General
“shall” submit a statement and that statement “shall” include the following: 
“…citations to the specific statutes, administrative regulations and, where appropriate, 
judicial decisions which demonstrate adequate authority.”
I am concerned that there may not have been an in-depth Attorney General review as required, 
and as a result Virginia may have adopted rules which are not statutorily supported on the state 
or federal level.  
Thank you for considering my concerns.

Re:  Comments on the Victorville 2 Draft PSD Permit 
 
Dear Ms. Lee: 
 
On behalf of California Unions for Reliable Energy (“CURE”), this letter 
provides comments on the EPA’s draft prevention of significant deterioration 
(“PSD”) air permit for the City of Victorville’s proposed power plant (“Project”).  The 
Project is a 563 MW electric generating facility located in the City of Victorville in 
San Bernardino County.  The EPA’s Region 9, the PSD permitting authority, issued 
a statement of basis and ambient Air Quality Impact Report (“SOB”) and a Draft 
Clean Air Act PSD Permit (“Draft Permit”).1  
 
CURE is a coalition of labor unions whose members help solve the state’s 
energy problems by building, maintaining and operating conventional and 
renewable energy power plants.  Since its founding in 1997, CURE has been 
committed to building a strong economy and a healthier environment.  (See 
http://www.sbctc.org/cure/.)  Individual members of the CURE unions live in and 
use areas that will suffer the impacts of the Project.  These members breathe the 
polluted air and suffer the adverse health and safety impacts from unnecessary air

PSD Permit”); Docket No. EPA-R09-OAR-2008-0406-0017; and Statement of Basis and Ambient Air 
Quality Impact Report for a Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit, June 2008

pollution.  Given the proximity to this and other projects, CURE has helped cut 
smog-forming pollutants in half, reduced toxic emissions, increased the use of 
recycled water for cooling systems and pushed for groundbreaking pollution control 
equipment as the standard for all new power plants, all while ensuring new power 
plants are built with highly trained, professional workers who live and raise 
families in nearby communities. 
 
As discussed below, the proposed PSD Permit is inadequate because the 
proposed PSD Permit and the supporting Statement of Basis prevent full and fair 
public review;  EPA prematurely issued the application completeness determination 
rendering the determination deficient;  the EPA failed to determine that the Project 
may result in violations of the 24-hour PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard (“NAAQS”);  the best available control technology (“BACT”) 
determinations were incomplete and flawed, including the lack of a BACT 
determination for greenhouse gases and the failure to require BACT for particulate 
matter and carbon monoxide (“CO”) emissions from the combustion turbine 
generators (“CTGs”);  EPA failed to set a limit for the ammonia slip from the 
selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) system;  the proposed permit limits are not 
federally enforceable; and the project does not comply with the Endangered Species 
Act or the National Environmental Policy Act among other things described below.  
 
We have prepared these comments with the assistance of Dr. Petra Pless.  
Dr. Pless’ comments along with her curriculum vitae are provided herein as 
Attachment 1.  Please note that the expert’s comments supplement the issues 
addressed below, thus her comments should be addressed and responded to 
separately.  
I. 
THE PROPOSED PSD PERMIT AND STATEMENT OF BASIS DETER 
 
FULL AND ACCURATE PUBLIC REVIEW 
For all practical purposes, the proposed PSD Permit and the supporting 
Statement of Basis were presented in a way that makes it nearly impossible for an 
independent reviewer to trace and evaluate the EPA’s decision making process.  
 
The Statement of Basis did not present all of the information necessary for 
members of the public to verify whether the EPA’s determinations were correct. 
Instead, the reviewer was forced to consult a multitude of documents beyond the 
Applicant’s application for a PSD Permit (“PSD Application”), its supplements and 
the EPA’s administrative record for this project.  For example, rather than provide

1994-034a 
                                           
a complete BACT analysis for each pollutant and source subject to PSD review to 
support the BACT-based permit limits in the body of the document, the Statement 
of Basis provided only brief summaries that were based on a number of additional 
documents.  The PM10 (as a surrogate for PM2.5) BACT analysis for the Project’s 
CTGs is a prime example.  The Statement of Basis provided the following terse 
summary:  
 
Particulate emissions from the gas turbine trains result from fuel sulfur, 
inert trace contaminants, and incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. We do 
not believe that any add-on particulate emission controls have been 
demonstrated in practice for this type of source. Thus, the proposed permit 
limits the sulfur content of the fuel to no more than 0.2 grains per 100 dry 
standard cubic feet as BACT, which would limit sulfate particulate emissions. 
 
We are proposing to limit particulate emissions (PM and PM10) to 12 lb/hr 
from each turbine without duct burner firing, and 18 lb/hr with duct burner 
firing. As noted earlier, using PM10 as a surrogate for PM2.5 does not affect 
the emission controls selected as BACT.2 
 
The EPA’s conclusion regarding PM and PM2.5 BACT appear to be based on 
the BACT analyses contained in two supplemental submissions to the PSD 
Application for PM2.5 and PM, but the Statement of Basis did not mention these 
documents.  These supplements to the PSD Application can be found in the docket 
on the EPA’s website.3  Our review of these documents shows that they, in turn, do 
not contain all of the information relied upon to come to conclusions regarding 
BACT either.  The necessary information, specifically, the PM and PM10 permit 
limits from the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s BACT Guidelines 
and the EPA’s RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse for other, similar facilities relied 
upon to determine the BACT permit limits for Victorville II are not provided in the 
supplements to the PSD Application, or for that matter anywhere in documents

listed on the EPA’s website.  The respective BACT determinations contain no 
reference where to find the information they relied upon to reach their conclusions 
regarding the proposed BACT permit limits.  The docket shows that a number of 
California Energy Commission documents have been submitted into the 
administrative record, such as the Application for Certification (“AFC”,4 the 
Preliminary5 and Final Staff Assessments,6 and some mysterious “Distribution of 
Supplemental Information,” which are not available directly on the EPA’s website 
but rather are available on the CEC’s website.7  This sends the reviewer on a wild 
goose chase searching through these several hundred-page documents and their 
respective, equally long appendices, updates, and revisions to find the most up-to-
date list of permit limits for these pollutants.  At a bare minimum, EPA should have 
referenced and provided cites to the relevant data.  
 
The EPA’s failure to “show its work” runs counter to its obligation to conduct 
an independent review of the Applicant’s BACT determinations, giving instead the 
impression that EPA simply-rubber-stamped the application.  In addition, the 
review process the EPA used here effectively frustrated public review and analysis.  
The analytic path showing the basis for the EPA’s decisions must be clear and well-
documented in a stand-alone document referencing a few clearly identified 
documents without requiring the reviewer to wade through literally stacks of 
documents on the EPA’s and the California Energy Commission’s websites.  
 
Finally, CURE’s experts attempted to evaluate the Project’s modeling data 
purported to be part of EPA’s administrative record.  However, the modeling data 
was completely omitted from the record.  CURE attempted to obtain the modeling 
data on July 3, 2008, however no one at Region 9 was available to provide the data.  
This omission begs the question whether EPA itself ever reviewed the modeling 
data.

II. 
THE EPA’S COMPLETENESS DETERMINATION WAS ISSUED 
PREMATURELY AND IS DEFICIENT  
On June 13, 2007, the EPA issued an application completeness determination 
(“Completeness Determination”) to the Applicant stating that the EPA received the 
initial PSD Application on May 8, 2007 and an update on June 22, 2007, which 
together would cover the pollutants NOx, CO, and PM2.5, and that the EPA deems 
the PSD Application administratively complete.8  The Completeness Determination 
was prematurely made and is thus invalid for several reasons.  
 
First, the Completeness Determination was issued prematurely because it 
did not address PM, one of the criteria pollutants subject to PSD review.9  On 
December 20, 2007, six months after the Completeness Determination was issued, 
the EPA requested information regarding PM and received a PM analysis from the 
Applicant on January 28, 2008.10 An analysis of PM is essential for the EPA’s 
review of the Project as PM is a regulated PSD pollutant.  Thus, this information 
was required to be available to the EPA before issuing a Completeness 
Determination.  EPA’s request for this information six months after issuing the 
Completeness Determination demonstrated that the Completeness Determination 
was issued prematurely because it omitted PM.   
 
Second, greenhouse gases are also pollutants subject to regulation under the 
Clean Air Act, as discussed in more detail in Comment IV.A and the EPA was 
required to address these pollutants in its review and ensure that the Applicant had 
provided EPA with all necessary information prior to issuing a Completeness 
Determination. Therefore, the Completeness Determination is invalid because it 
failed to address pollutants subject to regulation under the Act.  
 
Third, the Agency failed to set PM2.5 BACT limits, instead using PM10 
BACT as a surrogate.  As discussed below this approach violates federal law.

In sum, the EPA prematurely issued the Applicant a Completeness 
Determination even though the Application itself was deficient of critical 
information and analyses essential to the PSD Application.  
 
III. 
The Agency’s PM2.5 PSD Analysis Is Flawed 
 
The Statement of Basis identified PM2.5 as an attainment pollutant subject 
to PSD review.11  For purposes of PSD review of PM2.5, the Agency determined that 
the use of PM10 as a surrogate for PM2.5 is appropriate.12  Accordingly, the Project 
impact analysis of ambient air quality relied on modeling of estimated PM10 
emissions.13  For a 24-hour averaging period, maximum project impacts from all 
Project sources were estimated at 6.1 µg/m3 of PM2.5 (on a PM10 as a surrogate 
basis).  On an annual basis, maximum Project impacts were modeled at 0.3 µg/m3 of 
PM2.5 (on a PM10 as a surrogate basis).14,15  Based on these modeled maximum 
impacts, the Agency concluded that Project operation would not cause a violation of 
the PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) and would therefore 
not be significant.16  The Agency’s analyses violate federal law and are flawed. 
Therefore, the Agency’s conclusions regarding the significance of Project impacts 
are erroneous as shown below.  
 
A. 
The Use of PM10 as a Surrogate for PM2.5 Violates Federal 
Law and Relies on Guidance That Is In Conflict with Statutory 
Requirements and Is No Longer Technically Justified  
 
Contrary to the Agency’s assertions, PM10 cannot be used as a surrogate for 
PM2.5 for purposes of PSD review.  This surrogate approach violates federal law

and relies on guidance that is in conflict with statutory requirements, and is no 
longer technically justified.  
 
Using PM10 as if it were PM2.5 violates federal and state law.  The EPA 
since 1997 has distinguished PM2.5 from PM10, most importantly by setting 
different NAAQS for each pollutant based on their different health impacts.32  The 
Clean Air Act contains specific requirements regarding areas whose air quality 
violates the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS.31  Therefore, the 
EPA must determine directly whether the project will result in a significant 
emissions increase and significant net emissions increase of PM2.5 to ensure 
protection of the public health and compliance with the NAAQS.  
 
Further, the EPA based its decision to use PM10 as a surrogate for PM2.5 
emissions on its “October 23, 1997 transition memo guidelines, which authorize 
limits for PM10 as a surrogate for limits on PM2. 5 during the transition period 
lasting until final PSD PM2.5 regulations are issued…”17  Reliance on this memo 
was improper and invalidates the EPA’s analysis of PM2.5.  
 
First, the EPA cannot rely on guidance that does not have the force of law 
when that guidance, as here, is in conflict with statutory and regulatory 
requirements.  Further, a BACT limit is required “for each regulated NSR pollutant 
for which the source has the potential to emit in significant amounts.”18  A 
“regulated NSR pollutant” includes any “pollutant for which a national ambient air 
quality standard has been promulgated…” and any other “pollutant that otherwise 
is subject to regulation under the [Clean Air] Act...”19  Therefore, the Agency should 
have analyzed PM2.5 as a separate pollutant and issued a separate PM2.5 BACT 
limit.  
 
Second, the Agency’s recommended use of PM10 as a surrogate for PM2.5 
expired by its own terms when the EPA published the final PM2.5 implementation 
rule in September 2007.20  The 1997 memo cited above provided interim guidance

for implementing the new PM2.5 NAAQS.21  This ten-year-old memo stated that 
sources could use the PM10 surrogacy approach to meet NSR requirements until 
certain difficulties were resolved, most notably with respect to monitoring, 
emissions estimation, and air quality modeling.  A more recent EPA memo 
reaffirmed the surrogacy approach specifically for nonattainment NSR, but noted 
that EPA recommended using PM10 as a surrogate for PM2.5 “until [U.S. EPA] 
promulgate[s] the PM2.5 implementation rule.”22  As mentioned above, the final 
PM2.5 implementation rule has been published in September 2007. 
 
Third, technical difficulties in directly implementing the PM2.5 NAAQS that 
grounded the 1997 interim guidance have been resolved.  The EPA itself noted in 
the preamble to the November 2005 Proposed PM2.5 Implementation Rule that 
these technical concerns have been resolved: “As discussed in this preamble, those 
difficulties have been resolved in most respects, and where they have not been, the 
proposal contains appropriate provisions to account for it.”23  The EPA also has 
included the PM2.5 algorithms in the AERMOD air quality computer modeling 
program, the recommended model for short distance air quality assessment, thus 
formally resolving prior concerns about PM2.5 modeling capabilities.24  
 
B. 
The Agency Must Implement the Final Rule for 
Implementation of the New Source Review Program for PM2.5 
 
On May 8, 2008, EPA finalized its regulations to implement the NSR 
program for fine particulate matter, effective July 15, 2008.25  The new rule, 
entitled “Final Rule for Implementation of the New Source Review (NSR) Program 
for Particulate Matter Less Than 2.5 Micrometers (PM2.5),” requires all sources to 
determine Project impacts on a PM2.5 as PM2.5 basis.  The rule applies to all

projects except those where EPA had issued a valid completeness determination 
prior to the rule’s effective date.26 
 
As shown above, the EPA’s Completeness Determination was premature 
because the application is incomplete in numerous ways.  EPA must rescind the 
proposed PSD Permit, request a BACT analysis of greenhouse gases from the 
Applicant, and issue a new Completeness Determination once these BACT analyses 
have been submitted.  Because this new Completeness Determination will occur 
after July 15, 2008, the Agency must also include a PM2.5 BACT analysis based on 
the Final Implementation Rule’s requirements. 
 
C. 
Modeled PM2.5 Emissions from the Project’s Stationary 
Sources Exceed PM10 Significant Impact Levels  
 
The EPA was required to find significant impacts for PM2.5 emissions from 
the Project when using the PM10 surrogacy approach. The first step in determining 
whether a source would cause significant deterioration of air quality is to compare 
maximum modeled ambient air concentrations of attainment pollutants to 
established significant impact levels (“SILs”), also called significance levels. A SIL 
for a given criteria pollutant and averaging period is defined as the ambient 
concentration produced by a source’s emissions below which the source is assumed 
to have a less-than-significant impact on air quality.  The SILs for emissions of SO2, 
PM10, NOx, CO, and O3 in Class II areas can be found in the EPA’s NSR Manual,27 
Table C-4.28  The Class II SIL for PM10 established for a 24-hour period is 
5.0 µg/m3. The Class II PM10 SIL on an annual basis is 1.0µg/m3.29  The Class I SIL 
for PM10 established for a 24-hour period for areas located within 100 kilometers of 
a Class I area is 1.0 µg/m3.30  (The Project is located within 100 kilometers of five

The EPA opted to use the PM10 surrogacy approach for analyzing PM2.5 
impacts.  Under the PM10 surrogacy approach, PM10 is used as a surrogate for 
PM2.5.  Practically, this means that PM10 emissions are calculated and modeled to 
determine ambient PM10 concentrations and these are compared to PM10 
thresholds, in this case, the PM10 SILs.  The EPA did not mention the 24-hour and 
annual PM10 SILs and instead notes that SILs for PM2.5 have not yet been 
established.32  The EPA failed to identify that the modeled 24-hour PM10 ambient 
air quality concentrations of 6.1 µg/m3 by far exceed the Class II PM10 SIL of 5.0 
µg/m3 established for a 24-hour period.  
 
Because EPA followed the surrogacy approach for PM2.5, it must finish what 
it started.  The EPA must model 24-hour PM10 ambient concentrations with the 
24-hour PM10 SIL to determine the significance of the Project.  Using the 24-hour 
PM10 SIL to determine significance of maximum project impacts is analogous to the 
use of the PM10 significant emissions rate to determine whether PSD applies for 
PM2.5.  The EPA used the PSD significant emissions rate to determine PSD 
applicability for the Project,33 but failed to explain why the PM10 SILs are not 
equally applicable for determining significance.  
 
Under the PM10 surrogacy approach, EPA should have required the 
Applicant to conduct a full-impact analysis to determine if the Project plus existing 
sources would cause a significant ambient impact anywhere, including whether it 
would cause or contribute to a violation of any NAAQS or PSD increment, among 
others.  As the area where the Project is located is nonattainment for PM10, any 
increase in PM10 will contribute to a NAAQS violation and thus any increase in 
PM10 emissions is per se a significant impact.  Thus, the Application is incomplete. 
The EPA must rescind the Application Completeness Determination and require 
that the Applicant complete a full-impact analysis. 
 
Further, the EPA has recently proposed three different options for Class I 
and Class II SILs for PM2.5.34  The proposed Class II SIL options for a 24-hour 
period are 5.0, 4.0, and 1.2 µg/m3.  The modeled Project emissions exceed all three of

the proposed options for the 24-hour Class II SIL.  Therefore, Project emissions are 
significant no matter which option of the proposed SILs will be promulgated.  The 
corresponding annual SIL options are 1.0, 0.08, and 0.3 µg/m3.  If the latter option 
were promulgated, annual Project impacts, estimated at 0.3 µg/m3 would also be 
significant.  The proposed Class I SIL options for a 24-hour period are 0.08, 0.24, 
and 0.07 µg/m3.  Several maximum modeled concentrations would exceed the 
proposed 0.07 and the 0.08 µg/m3 SIL in the Cucamonga, San Gorgonio, and San 
Gabriel Wilderness Areas.35  Thus, when using the new PM2.5 SILs, Project 
impacts are also significant.  
 
Finally, as discussed below, the Applicant underestimated PM10 (as a 
surrogate for PM2.5) emissions because it failed to include in its emissions 
calculations fugitive dust emissions from wind erosion of the solar field and 
unpaved roads and from entrained road dust from operations and maintenance 
vehicles traveling on unpaved roads on site.  Thus, the PM2.5 emissions will likely 
exceed the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS.  
 
D. 
Fugitive Dust PM2.5 Emissions from the Project May Result in 
a Violation of the 24-Hour National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard for PM2.5  
 
In addition to PM2.5 emissions from the Project’s fossil-fuel powered 
stationary equipment and the cooling tower, the Project would also result in 
substantial fugitive dust particulate matter emissions due to wind erosion of the 
250-acre graded solar field during construction and operation of the Project and the 
two 20-acre and 30-acre graded construction laydown areas.  The Applicant intends 
to use a chemical dust suppressant on the graded areas during construction, but did 
not provide information on dust control of the graded solar field during its 
operational phase.36  Even if the use of dust suppressants were intended, they have 
been found to have little efficacy at suppressing small respirable dust particles. 
Further, while chemical dust suppressants have a relatively high initial efficiency,

estimated to vary between 40 and 98 percent, the control efficiency has been found 
to decay to zero within a few months.37  
 
In addition, fugitive dust emissions would result from entrained road dust 
emissions from operations and maintenance vehicles driving on the unpaved solar 
field, and entrained road dust from delivery and waste removal vehicles traveling 
on paved and unpaved roads off-site.  (The Applicant estimated that the Project 
would have 13 vehicles on site for operations and maintenance, which are estimated 
to drive a total of 79 miles per month on unpaved roads.) 
 
Major sources that belong to one of the 27 source categories under 40 CFR 
52.21 must include fugitive emissions, i.e. emissions that cannot reasonably pass 
through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent opening, in their 
potential to emit (“PTE”).  The source category “Fossil fuel-fired steam electric 
plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input” applies 
to the Project.38  Therefore, calculations of Project emissions must include fugitive 
emissions.39  The Applicant’s modeled Project PM2.5 emissions only accounted for 
the Project’s stationary emissions including the CTGs and duct burners, the 
auxiliary heater, the auxiliary boiler, the emergency diesel engine, and the cooling 
tower, but failed to account for fugitive dust particulate matter emissions.40 
 
As mentioned before, modeling of the Project’s stationary source PM10 (as a 
surrogate for PM2.5) emissions resulted in a maximum project impact of 
6.1 µg/m3.41 Added to the background ambient concentration of 26 µg/m3, this 
results in a total impact of 32.1 µg/m3, less than 3 µg/m3 lower than 24-hour NAAQS 
of 35 µg/m3.  If the PM2.5 fraction of fugitive dust emissions were included in the 
modeling, the NAAQS would likely be exceeded. Therefore, the Completeness 
Determination must be rescinded and the Applicant directed to estimate fugitive 
emissions and revise the dispersion modeling to include them.

IV.  
THE EPA FAILED TO DETERMINE THAT PM2.5 EMISSIONS FROM 
THE PROJECT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT 
 For purposes of the Project’s PSD review for PM2.5, the EPA determined 
that the use of PM10 as a surrogate for PM2.5 was appropriate.42  Accordingly, the 
analysis of Project impacts on ambient air quality relied on modeling of estimated 
PM10 emissions.43  For a 24-hour averaging period, maximum project impacts from 
all Project sources were estimated at 6.1 µg/m3 of PM2.5 (on a PM10 as a surrogate 
basis).  On an annual basis, maximum Project impacts were modeled at 0.3 µg/m3.44  
Based on these modeled maximum impacts, the EPA concluded that operation of 
Victorville II would not cause a violation of the PM2.5 NAAQS.45  There are a 
number of problems with the EPA’s analyses and conclusions and the Applicant’s 
supporting documents, as shown below. 
 
A.  
Modeled PM2.5 Emissions from the Project’s Stationary 
 
Sources Exceed the PM10 Significant Impact Level 
The first step in determining whether a source would cause significant 
deterioration of air quality is to compare maximum modeled ambient air 
concentrations of attainment pollutants to established significant impact levels 
(“SILs”), also called significance levels.  A SIL for a given criteria pollutant and 
averaging period is defined as the ambient concentration produced by a source’s 
emissions below which the source is assumed to have a less-than-significant impact 
on air quality.  
 
The SILs for emissions of SO2, PM10, NOx, CO, and O3 in Class II areas can 
be found in the EPA’s NSR Manual,46 Table C-4.47  The SIL for PM10 established

for a 24-hour period is 1.0 µg/m3 for areas located within 100 kilometers of a Class I 
area.48  The Project is located within 100 kilometers of five Class I areas, and just 
outside of 100 kilometers from Joshua Tree National Park.49  The PM10 SIL on an 
annual basis is also 1.0 µg/m3.50  The EPA failed to identify that the modeled 24-
hour PM10 ambient air quality concentrations of 6.1 µg/m3 greatly exceeded the 
PM10 SIL of 1.0 µg/m3 established for a 24-hour period.  The EPA made no mention 
of the 24-hour and annual PM10 SILs, but instead noted that SILs for PM2.5 have 
not yet been established.51  
 
Because EPA followed the surrogate approach for PM2.5, the EPA should 
have compared modeled 24-hour PM10 emissions with the 24-hour PM10 SIL to 
determine significance for impacts on ambient air quality from Project emissions. 
Using the 24-hour PM10 SIL to determine significance of maximum project impacts 
is analogous to the use of the PM10 significant emissions rate to determine whether 
PSD applies for PM2.5.  The EPA used the PSD significant emissions rate to 
determine PSD applicability for the Project,52 but failed to explain why the PM10 
SILs are not equally applicable for determining significance.

suppressants have a relatively high initial efficiency, estimated to vary between 40 
and 98 percent, the control efficiency has been found to decay to zero within a few 
months.54  
 
In addition, fugitive dust emissions will result from entrained road dust 
emissions from operations and maintenance vehicles driving on the unpaved solar 
field, and entrained road dust from delivery and waste removal vehicles traveling 
on paved and unpaved roads off-site.  (The Applicant estimated that the Project will 
have 13 vehicles on site for operations and maintenance, which are estimated to 
drive a total of 79 miles per month on unpaved roads.)  
 
Major sources that belong to one of the 27 source categories under EPA’s CAA 
regulations at 40 CFR 52.21 must include fugitive emissions, i.e. emissions that 
cannot reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally

Determination must be rescinded and the Applicant directed to estimate fugitive

V. 
THE PROPOSED PSD PERMIT’S BACT DETERMINATIONS ARE 
INCOMPLETE AND DEFICIENT  
Under the Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations, EPA was required 
to include in the proposed PSD Permit emissions limits consistent with “best 
available control technology” for each pollutant subject to regulation under the 
Act.59  As shown below, the proposed PSD Permit lacks a BACT analysis and permit 
limits for emissions of greenhouse gases.  Also shown below, the proposed BACT 
limits for criteria pollutants suffer from a variety of other errors such as the failure 
to follow the top-down BACT procedure.  Finally, the proposed emission limits for 
PM10 (as a surrogate for PM2.5) and for CO suffer from the same fundamental 
flaw, i.e. the failure to set a BACT limit based on the maximum degree of reduction 
that is achievable.  
 
A. 
The Proposed PSD Permit Lacks a BACT Analysis and Permit 
Limits for Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 
The Project will emit greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (“CO2”) and 
nitrous oxide (“N2O”) from combustion processes, and methane (“CH4”) from 
unburned natural gas due to leakage from the natural gas pipelines.  Other 
greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Project include sulfur hexafluoride 
(“SF6”), which is used as a gaseous insulator in the Project’s high-voltage circuit 
breakers, and hydrofluorocarbons (“HFCs”) and perfluorocarbons (“PFCs”), which 
are used in its refrigeration/chiller equipment.60  The Applicant estimated 2,020,664 
metric tons of annual CO2-equivalent emissions of these pollutants from the 
Project’s stationary sources and from circuit breaker leaks.61

It is now beyond dispute that greenhouse gases are pollutants subject to 
regulation under the Clean Air Act.62  Therefore, PSD permits must include a 
BACT analysis and a permit limit for greenhouse gas emissions.  The draft PSD 
permit contains neither.  Accordingly, the draft permit is deficient and must be 
revised because it omitted a BACT limit for these same polluta
 
 
Clearly, the Project will be a “major emitting facility” as defined by the CAA 
because it is a “fossil-fuel fired steam electric plant” of a size greater than the 
statutory threshold.63  Thus, because the Project will be a “major emitting facility” 
it must incorporate BACT for all regulated pollutants.  Accordingly, there is n
technical or legal justification for omitting greenhouse gases from the draft permit’s 
BACT analysis.  In fact, the applicant and EPA were required to identify, evaluate, 
and apply available technologies that would control greenhouse gas emissions, but 
the draft permit contains no greenhouse gas emission limits whatsoever.  EPA was 
required to impose emission limits for greenhouse gases, and was required to 
include a BACT limit, because Clean Air Act section 165(a)(4) requires BACT “for 
each pollutant subject to regulation” and emitted from regulated facilities such as 
the Project.64   
 
 
EPA has regulated CO2, a primary component of greenhouse gas, under the 
CAA since 1993 when the agency adopted regulations for CAA section 821 requiring 
monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting of facility’s CO2 emissions.  Then, in 2007, 
the Supreme Court held that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” under the CAA.65  
In short, greenhouse gases are now a regulated pollutant under section 821(a) of the 
CAA, and EPA is required to impose greenhouse gas BACT emission limits in any 
final PSD permit for the Project.  Under section 821(a) and its implementing 
regulations, a “regulated NSR pollutant” is defined as: 
 
(50) Regulated NSR pollutant, for purposes of this section, means the 
following:  
 
 
62 According to the Supreme Court, “greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act’s capacious 
definition of air pollutant.”  Massachusetts v. EPA, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 1460 (2007).

(i) Any pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard has been 
promulgated and any constituents or precursors for such pollutants identified 
by the Administrator (e.g., volatile organic compounds and NOx are 
precursors for ozone);  
 
(ii) Any pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 
111 of the Act;  
 
(iii) Any Class I or II substance subject to regulation under or established by 
title VI of the Act; or 
 
(iv) Any pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulations under the 
Act, except that any or all hazardous air pollutants either listed in section 
112 of the Act or added to the list pursuant to section 112(b)(2) of the Act, 
which have not been delisted pursuant to section 112(b)(3) of the Act, are not 
regulated NSR pollutants unless the listed hazardous air pollutant is also 
regulated as a constituent or precursor of a general pollutant listed under 
section 108 of the Act.66 
 
It is unclear whether EPA omitted greenhouse gas analysis from the SOB 
and an emission limitation in the draft permit simply because EPA has not 
established a major source threshold.67  Nevertheless, limiting BACT 
determinations to those air pollutants for which there is a separate, general 
numerical limitation effectively ignores section (iv) of the above regulation which 
unequivocally aims to encompass all pollutants that are “otherwise subject to 
regulation under the Act.”  Thus, as a matter of law, the draft permit and SOB 
which utterly omit any mention, much less analysis, of the project’s CO2 emissions, 
is in direct violation of the Clean Air Act.   
 
Based on the foregoing, EPA must perform a BACT analysis and set BACT-
based emission limits for CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions from the Project. 
The BACT analysis must include a discussion of available technologies that would 
 
66 40 C.F.R. § 52.21(b)(50) (emphasis added).  
67 BACT requirements encompass all pollutants subject to regulation under the CAA whether or not 
they are independently subject to NAAQS or other limits. See, e.g., Friends of the Chattahoochee v. 
Georgia Dept of Natural Resources, Docket No. 2008CV146398, p. 7 (June 30, 2008).

reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  For example, on a per-unit energy basis, the use 
of duct burners is far less efficient than using a larger turbine without duct burners 
or a small micro- or aeroderivative turbine for peaking power.  These options would 
produce far less greenhouse gas emissions than the proposed duct-fired system.  
The proposed “major emitting facility” is still the same kind of statutorily defined 
“facility” under the Clean Air Act whether it uses duct burners or not.  Accordingly, 
the Project should be prohibited from using duct burners because there is a more 
effective alternative for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The BACT analysis 
should therefore analyze Project efficiency on a unit-energy basis and potential 
options to increase efficiency such as abandoning the use of duct burners, use of 
thermally more efficient aeroderivative turbines instead of duct burners, requiring 
a higher percentage of solar power generation, use of CO2 capture and storage 
technologies, use of oxy-firing, and other innovative technologies.   
 
B. 
The EPA Failed to Follow Its Own Procedures in Establishing 
BACT Limits 
 
The Statement of Basis provided the definition of BACT under the Clean Air 
Act and outlined the mechanics of the five steps involved in a top-down BACT 
analysis.  EPA verified that the five-step top-down procedure has been consistently 
followed by the Environmental Appeals Board in adjudicating PSD permit 
appeals.68  
 
Unfortunately, beyond this generic explanation, the Statement of Basis did 
not follow the five-step top-down BACT analysis for the Project, but instead merely 
provided short summaries and conclusions for each of the Project’s emission units 
and pollutants.  Specifically, EPA omitted the required in-depth analysis and 
support for its conclusions, and as such did not follow the five steps for a Project-
specific top-down BACT analysis.69  As discussed in section I above, the Statement 
of Basis, did not cite to or reference the supporting documents; thus, the analytic 
path EPA traveled to derive its unsupported conclusions is entirely unclear to the 
public.   Perhaps, EPA simply relied on the BACT analyses contained in the 
Applicant’s PSD Application, and several later documents, as well as numerous 
documents contained on the California Energy Commission’s website including the 
Preliminary Staff Assessment, the Final Staff Assessment, and an unidentified

“Supplemental Information” document.  In any case, members of the public have no 
way of knowing.  
 
The problem is compounded by the Applicant’s own failure to follow the 
established five-step top-down BACT procedure, rendering the Applicant’s own 
BACT determination fatally flawed.  As shown below, there has been no top-down 
BACT analyses for: the CO BACT determination for the CTGs, the PM and PM2.5 
BACT determination for the CTGs, and the BACT determinations for the auxiliary 
boiler, the auxiliary heater, emergency diesel engine, and the firewater pump.   
 
C. 
The CO BACT Determination for CTGs Is Flawed  
 
The Statement of Basis contained the following paragraph as a CO BACT 
analysis for the CTGs:  
 
Carbon monoxide (CO) occurs due to incomplete combustion of natural gas in 
the gas turbine, and in the duct burners when they are operated. The 
applicant has proposed to install an oxidation catalyst to control CO. The 
application states that the facility will achieve 2.0 ppmvd CO over a 1-hour 
averaging period when it does not use duct burning, excluding startups and 
shutdowns. BACT for periods of startup and shutdown are discussed in 
Section 7.1.4. We believe 2.0 ppmvd CO is the lowest emission rate that has 
been included in a permit for a facility of this type. The application also 
requests a slightly higher 3.0 ppmvd CO emission rate when duct burning is 
used, due to higher CO concentrations from the duct burners. While the 
facilities we reviewed generally have higher emission rates, there are some 
facilities with a 2.0 ppmvd CO limit that applies at all times. We believe that 
the combination of emission rates proposed by the applicant falls within the 
stricter end of the range of emission rates acceptable as BACT for CO, based 
on our review of data in the RBLC. Replacing duct burning with solar energy, 
when available, will reduce the amount of time that the facility would use 
duct burning with the higher CO emission rates.70

Neither the EPA’s one paragraph CO BACT determination nor the CO BACT 
determination contained in the PSD Application for the Project’s CTGs included any 
of the five steps followed in a top-down BACT analysis, i.e. 1) identify available 
control options; 2) eliminate technically infeasible options; 3) rank the remaining 
control technologies; 4) evaluate the most effective control alternative; and, 5) select 
BACT.71  In fact, neither the Statement of Basis nor the PSD Application even 
mentioned which technologies are available to reduce CO emissions from the CTGs.  
 
Available control technologies that should have been analyzed include good 
combustion practices, alternatives to duct burning, catalytic oxidation, thermal 
oxidation, and SCONOX.  (Presumably, duct burning and the use of solar power 
would occur concurrently during periods of high demand.  Therefore, solar energy 
would not reduce the amount of time that the facility would use duct burning in the 
summer, contrary to the EPA’s suggestion.  Further additional solar could be 
added.)  Instead, the PSD Application’s CO BACT determination contained a “Top-
down Ranking of Achievable Control Levels,” which simply excerpted CO permit 
limits for a number of facilities from the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District’s BACT Guidelines and the EPA’s RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse.72  
This approach is inadequate.  The provided documents do not discuss which control 
technologies these facilities employ to comply with their CO permit limits.73   EPA’s 
approach was neither legally or technically consistent with the NSR Manual’s 
longstanding methodology.  
 
The Application’s CO BACT determination proposed CO limits and then 
concluded that the facility would use an oxidation catalyst to comply with the 
proposed limits.  As such, the Applicant’s CO BACT analyses omitted explanation of 
how it determined that the use of an oxidation catalyst would constitute BACT, and 
why other control technologies, or combinations of control technologies, would not 
be feasible.74  This “analysis” is insufficient to determine that the proposed permit

limits are indeed BACT for CO emissions from the CTGs, especially because the 
EPA erred in determining BACT for the CTGs.  The Permit and Statement of Basis 
must be revised.  
 
2. 
Lower CO Limits Have Been Permitted Under All Firing 
Conditions 
 
The Draft PSD Permit limits CO emissions from the CTGs to 2.0 ppm when 
the duct burners are not in use and to 3.0 ppm when the duct burners are firing 
based on the use of an oxidation catalyst and averaged over one hour.75   
 
Other similar combined-cycle projects that incorporate duct firing have been 
permitted at 2.0 ppm with no CO limit adjustment or a lower CO limit when duct 
firing.  (See attached Table A-2 for a partial list of these Projects.)  In fact, the 
Applicant’s summary of BACT determinations obtained from the EPA’s RBLC 
database shows 11 such determinations.76  The lowest CO limits were permitted for 
Kleen Energy Systems, CT, whose two Siemens SGT6-5000 F turbines were 
permitted at 0.9 ppm CO with the duct burners off and at 1.7 ppm CO when firing 
the 445 MMBtu/hr duct burners.77  The Applicant did not mention the permit limits 
for Kleen Energy Systems.  In addition, CPV Warren, VA, was permitted with two 
of either GE7FA, GE207FA, or Siemens STG6-5000F turbines at 1.8 ppm CO with 
the duct burners off and at 2.5 ppm CO with the duct burners firing.  Based on the 
Applicant’s RBLC summary table, ten power plants in Arizona, California, Georgia, 
Michigan, Oregon, and Washington have been permitted at 2.0 ppm CO with no CO 
limit adjustment for the duct burners.  These include COB Energy Facility, OR, 
Duke Energy Arlington Valley II, AZ, Vernon City’s Malburg Generating Station, 
CA, Magnolia Power Project, CA, and McIntosh Combined Cycle Facility, GA.  
Finally, the BP West Coast Products Cherry Point Cogeneration Project, WA, was 
also permitted at 2.0 ppm under all firing conditions.  Several power plants have 
demonstrated compliance with these low permitted limits as discussed below.

The Applicant’s CO BACT determination for the CTGs merely stated that 
duct burners would emit additional CO, increasing the uncontrolled emission levels 
entering the oxidation catalyst.  The Application failed to reasonably explain why 
the Project, with similar turbines, can not comply with the lower limits.78  The 
Statement of Basis, while recognizing that several facilities have been permitted 
with a lower CO limit of 2.0 ppm that applies at all times, including when the duct 
burners are firing, impermissibly rationalized the proposed higher CO limit for the 
Project of 3.0 ppm when the duct burners are firing, on grounds that “the 
combination of emission rates proposed by the applicant falls within the stricter 
range of emission rates acceptable as BACT for CO.”79  However, there is no 
justification for a higher CO limit while duct firing.  Clean Air Act section 169(3) 
defines BACT as “an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction 
… achievable for such source,” 80 not a “range of emission rates” as applied by 
the EPA. 
 
3. 
Lower CO Emissions Have Been Demonstrated in Practice 
 
Finally, basing BACT limits on previously permitted limits is a self-fulfilling 
prophecy that contravenes the technology-forcing nature of BACT.  A BACT limit 
must represent the lowest limit “achievable” for the source—not the lowest limit 
previously achieved by sources in the past.81  This forward-looking emphasis is the 
“most important” mechanism promoting the Clean Air Act’s “philosophy of 
encouragement of technology development.”82  The BACT standard is intended to 
require use of “the latest technological developments [in pollution control] as a 
requirement in granting the permit,” so as to “lead to rapid adoption of 
improvements in technology as new sources are built,” rather than “the stagnation 
that occurs when everyone works against a single national standard for new 
sources.”83

Here, the CO BACT determination impermissibly relied on emission levels 
that have been permitted in the past or demonstrated in the past at other sources. 
The record contained no evidence that an analysis was conducted to determine 
emission levels that are “achievable” with the selected BACT technology, as opposed 
to achieved.  The Applicant and the EPA should have collected and evaluated test 
data reported to the EPA under various regulatory programs, discussed technology 
performance and guarantees with vendors, and then made an engineering judgment 
based on physical and chemical principles using this data as to which limits are 
“achievable” for the Project to fulfill the technology forcing nature of BACT.  The 
permit limits for plants built in the past serve only as the starting point for the 
BACT analysis for what is achievable for a future plant.  Those limits cannot also be 
the end of the BACT analysis; limits achieved in the past are a floor, not the ceiling, 
for the BACT determination of what is “achievable” for a new source. 
 
For example, CO concentrations of 0.046 and 0.043 ppm at 15% oxygen were 
measured on the two GE Frame 7FA turbines at the Los Medanos Energy Center, 
at full load with duct burners on, during October 2001 compliance testing.84  
CO concentrations of 0.12 and 0.04 ppm were measured on the two SW 501FD 
turbines at the Sutter Power Project, at full load with duct burners on and power 
augmentation operational, during June 2001 compliance testing.85  Numerous such 
source tests demonstrate that much lower CO limits are routinely achieved at other 
similar facilities.  The EPA has access to this data and should collect and analyze it 
to make a fresh CO BACT determination that complies with the statutory and 
regulatory definition of BACT which require an emission limit based on the 
maximum degree of reduction that is achievable.

The PM and PM10 (as a Surrogate for PM2.5) BACT 
Determination for CTGs Was Flawed

particulate emission controls have been demonstrated in practice for this type of 
source, and that BACT for PM and PM2.5 emissions from this Project’s two General

particulate emissions.86  
 
1. 
The PM and PM2.5 BACT Determinations Did Not Follow 
the Top-down Procedure Established as Standard for 
BACT Analyses 
 
The EPA’s meager BACT analysis for PM and PM2.5 was presumably based 
on the Applicant’s equally short BACT analysis found in a supplement to the PSD 
Application for PM2.5.87  The Applicant’s PM and PM2.5 BACT determinations also 
did not follow the established five-step top-down BACT procedure.  (The additional 
supplement to the PSD Application for PM did not contain a BACT analysis, but 
rather relied on the PM2.5 supplement because PM emissions are assumed to be 
equal to the PM10/PM2.5 emissions.88)  Based on this scant data, the Statement of 
Basis and the Applicant’s PM2.5 BACT analysis concluded that BACT for both PM 
and PM10 (as a surrogate for PM2.5) emissions from the CTGs is 12.0 pounds per 
hour (“lb/hour”) without the duct burner firing and 18.0 lb/hour with the duct 
burner firing.89  There is no support in EPA’s administrative record for this 
conclusion, as neither the Statement of Basis nor the Applicant’s documents contain 
any discussion of achievable PM10 and PM2.5 emission levels, permitted PM and 
PM10 emission limits at similar facilities, or results of source tests.  As such, the 
entire analysis is deficient and flawed and must be redone.

2. 
Lower PM10 Emissions Limits Have Been Permitted  
 
A number of natural gas-fired power plants with substantially similar F-class 
turbines have been permitted by the EPA and licensed by the California Energy 
Commission with considerably lower PM10 emissions limits for the CTGs and 
associated duct burners than those EPA proposed here.  In California, these 
facilities include the Blythe Energy Project Phase II, the Cosumnes Power Plant 
Phase I, the Los Medanos Energy Facility, the Russell City Energy Center, the 
Moss Landing Power Plant Project, the Metcalf Energy Center, the Mountainview 
Power Plant Project, and the Inland Empire Energy Center.  Turbine and duct 
burner characteristics and permit limits for these facilities are summarized in 
attached Table A-1 and some facilities are discussed in more detail below.  
 
Particularly noteworthy is the Blythe Energy Project Phase II, which 
employed Siemens Westinghouse F-class turbines.  This facility was licensed by the 
Energy Commission in 2005 and permitted by the EPA in 2007 with an emission 
limit of 6.0 lb/hour of PM10 emissions per turbine with and without firing the duct 
burners and using natural gas with more than twice as much sulfur content as 
proposed for Victorville II.90,91,92  The Energy Commission required testing of the 
permitted PM10 limits based on EPA Methods 5 and 202,93 the same testing 
methods as proposed for this Project.94  On a unit energy-basis, the Blythe Energy 
Plant is permitted to emit 0.0034 lb/MMBtu of PM10 with the duct burners off and 
0.0031 lb/MMBtu with the duct burners firing, less than half of the PM10 emissions 
the EPA proposed here, i.e. 0.0069 lb/MMBtu with the duct burners on and 0.0083 
lb/MMBtu with the duct burners firing, and determined with the same test

the exhaust gases, why these lower emission levels cannot be achieved at this 
Project. 
 
3. 
Lower PM10 Emissions Have Been Demonstrated in 
Practice  
 
The Cosumnes Power Plant Phase I, which employed two GE 7FA turbines 
with no duct burners, was licensed by the Energy Commission in 2003 with an 
emissions limit of 9.0 lb/hr PM10 per turbine based on an emission factor of 0.00483 
lb/MMbtu.96  The Cosumnes Power Plant Phase I is operational and has 
demonstrated compliance with this emission limit.  The most recent stack tests 
measured average PM10 emission rates of 4.0 and 3.3 lb/hr from the two turbines, 
respectively, with EPA Methods 201A and 202.  On a unit energy-basis, average 
PM10 emissions were determined to be 0.00235 and 0.00195 lb/MMBtu, 
respectively, less than a third of the proposed PM10 emissions for this Project.97  
 
The Los Medanos Energy Center, which employed two GE S207FA turbines, 
was initially licensed with PM10 emission limits of 16.3 lb/hr per turbine train with 
and without duct burner operation.  In 2006, the project owner requested lowering 
the PM10 permit limits to 9.0 lb/hr based on stack tests repeatedly demonstrating 
PM10 emissions considerably below 9.0 lb/hr.  As a result, the Energy Commission 
approved revised turbine PM10 emission limits of 9.0 lb/hr or 0.0040 lb/MMBtu per 
turbine including when the 330 MMBtu/hr duct burner is firing.98 
 
95 Blythe II:  (6.0 lb/hr) / (1,776 MMBtu/hr turbine) = 0.0034 lb/MMBtu 
(6.0 lb/hr) / (1,776 MMBtu/hr turbine + 132 MMBtu/hr duct burner) = 0.0031 
lb/MMBtu;  
Victorville II: (12.0 lb/hr) / (1,736.4 MMBtu/hr turbine) = 0.0069 lb/MMBtu 
(18.0 lb/hr) / (1,736.4 MMBtu/hr turbine + 424.3 MMBtu duct burner) = 0.0083 
lb/MMBtu.

These examples and others given in Table A-1 for similar turbines, including 
other GE Frame 7FA turbines, demonstrate that the proposed PM10 (as a surrogate 
for PM2.5) limits of 12.0 lb/hr without and 18.0 lb/hr with duct burners firing are 
not BACT for the CTGs.  As shown for the CO BACT determination, the Applicant 
and the EPA should have collected and evaluated test data reported to the EPA 
under various regulatory programs, discussed technology performance and 
guarantees with vendors, and then made an engineering judgment based on 
physical and chemical principles using this data as to what limits are “achievable” 
for the Project to fulfill the technology-forcing nature of BACT.  The failure to fully 
employ the top-down BACT procedures rendered the entire analysis flawed.   
 
4. 
Demonstrated In Practice Is the Wrong Standard for 
Emission Control Technologies 
 
The Statement of Basis states without further discussion that no add-on 
particulate emission controls have been demonstrated in practice.  Demonstrated in 
practice is the LAER standard and does not apply to a BACT analysis.  A BACT 
technology need only be achievable.   
 
The NSR Manual sets out a process to determine the technical feasibility of a 
control technology that has not been installed and operated successfully on the type 
of source under review.  NSR Manual, Sec. IV.B.  If a technology is “available” and 
“applicable” it qualifies as a BACT technology that must be included in Step 2 of the 
top down process.  A technology is available if it can be obtained by the applicant 
through commercial channels or is otherwise available within the common sense 
meaning of the term.  An available technology is “applicable” if it can reasonably be 
installed and operated on the source type under consideration.  A technology that is 
available and applicable is technically feasible. 
 
There are a number of technologies that meet these criteria that should have 
been evaluated and required as BACT for PM10/PM2.5.  These include fabric filter 
baghouses, Pall filters, wet electrostatic precipitators (“Wet ESP” or “WESP”), 99

Determination must be revoked and the BACT analysis for PM2.5 redone to cure 
this serious deficiency.

Proposed Test Methods to Determine Compliance Require 
Lowering the PM and PM10 (as a Surrogate for PM2.5) 
BACT Limits 
 
The proposed PSD Permit requires determination of compliance with the PM 
and PM10 (as a surrogate for PM2.5) permit limits by measuring PM and PM10 
emissions using EPA’s Reference Methods 5 and 202.  In lieu of Method 202, the 
proposed PSD Permit allows the use of EPA Conditional Test Methods for 
particulate matter, i.e. CTM-039 or CTM-040.101 There are a number of problems 
with allowing the Applicant to choose from these test methods.  
 
First, EPA Conditional Test Method CTM-040 has been superseded by 
OTM27 on May 8, 2008.102,103  Thus, the proposed PSD Permit should be revised to 
refer to OTM27 and its successors, rather than CTM-040.

Second, the use of these test methods results in considerably different PM10 
measurements for the same source.  EPA Method 5 for filterable particulate matter 
and Method 202 for condensable particulate matter are known to overestimate 
PM10 emissions from gas turbines and other fired sources.104,105  Method 5 
measures total particulate matter, rather than PM10, thus overestimating actual 
PM10 emissions.  Method 202 overestimates condensable PM10 due to the 
formation of artifacts in the wet impinger train, such as the oxidation of SO2 to 
SO3.  The artifact problems with Method 202 can be minimized by selecting options 
listed in the method, such as nitrogen purge, which is required to determine 
compliance for Victorville II.106,107,108  To address these artifact problems, the U.S. 
EPA has developed alternative test method CTM-039 for total PM10, which employs 
a dilution tunnel method and measures both total PM10 and PM2.5, and is 
currently developing an alternate for Method 202.109  
 
Most stack tests at other facilities in the past used EPA Method 5 and 202 
without the nitrogen purge.110  Thus, the resulting measured emissions are 
artificially high and BACT determinations made using this data report emission 
limits are artificially high.  If these facilities were stack-tested with EPA Method 
202 using a nitrogen purge or with CTM-039, lower PM10 emissions rates would be 
measured.  These lower PM10 emissions should result in lower BACT emission 
limits.  Therefore, the proposed PSD Permit should have established separate 
permit limits for PM10 depending on the test method used to determine compliance.

In addition to the comments on the proposed PM10 BACT limits above, the 
Agency must revise its BACT determination to address the lower emission rates 
that would be achieved when using Method 5 with nitrogen purge or CTM-039. 
 
E. 
BACT Determinations for Auxiliary Boiler, Auxiliary, Heater, 
Emergency Engine, and Firewater Pump Are Flawed 
 
Most of the Applicant’s analyses for the auxiliary boiler, the heat transfer 
fluid (“HTF”) heater, the emergency diesel engine, and the firewater pump engine 
suffer from the same problems as the CO and PM and PM10 BACT analyses for the 
turbines, i.e. the failure to follow a top-down BACT procedure, resulting in failure to 
select proper BACT levels.  With the exception of the CO BACT determination for 
the auxiliary boiler and auxiliary heater, the Agency’s and the Applicant’s “BACT 
analyses” consist of one paragraph per unit with no further support for the 
conclusions in the docket.  
 
 
The EPA must revise the PM and PM10 (as a Surrogate for PM2.5) BACT 
Determination for CTGs and recirculate the analysis for public comment.  
VI. 
THE PROPOSED PSD PERMIT FAILS TO INCLUDE A PERMIT 
LIMIT FOR AMMONIA SLIP 
According to the Statement of Basis, the excess ammonia emissions from the 
CTGs’ selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) system, the so-called ammonia slip, 
would be limited to 5 ppmvd.111  Yet the proposed PSD Permit did not contain any 
restrictions on the ammonia slip from the SCR.  Because ammonia is a precursor to 
PM2.5 particulate matter emissions, the proposed PSD Permit must be revised to 
provide for monitoring and recordkeeping of the ammonia slip.   
VII. THE PROPOSED PSD PERMIT LIMITS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE 
The proposed permit limits must be enforceable as a practical matter to 
qualify as legitimate restrictions on emissions.  Practical enforceability means the 
source and/or enforcement authority must be able to show continual compliance (or 
 
111 Statement of Basis, p. 14.

noncompliance) with each limitation or requirement.112  The proposed PM/PM10 
limits are not practically enforceable because the proposed PSD Permit contains 
inadequate monitoring requirements. 
 
The EPA has substantial guidance on effectively limiting a source’s potential 
to emit through enforceable permit conditions.  Practical enforceability means the 
source must be able to show continuous compliance with each limitation or 
requirement.113  Adequate testing, monitoring, and record-keeping must be included 
in the permit.114  The permit conditions in the proposed PSD Permit provide no 
assurance that the proposed limits are enforceable as a practical matter.115  
 
 
The NSR Manual includes a chapter on “Effective Permit Writing.”  This 
chapter explains that emission and operational limits “must be clearly expressed, 
easily measurable, and allow no subjectivity… Such limits should be of a short term 
nature, continuous and enforceable.”116  In addition, an NSR Manual appendix 
further clarifies the meaning of enforceability: 
 
Compliance with any limitation must be able to be established at any given 
time. When drafting permit limitations, the writer must always ensure that 
restrictions are written in such a manner that an inspector could verify 
instantly whether the source is or was complying with the permit conditions. 
Therefore, short-term averaging times on limitations are essential. 
 
Emission limits should reflect operation of the control equipment, be short-
term, and, where feasible, the permit should require a continuous emissions 
monitor. Blanket emissions limits alone (e.g., tons/yr, lb/hr) are virtually 
impossible to verify or enforce, and are therefore not enforceable as a 
practical matter.  
 
 
112 See, U.S. v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. 682 F.Supp. 1122 (D. Colorado 1988).   
113 See, e.g., “Guidance on Limiting Potential to Emit in New Source Permitting,” from Terrell F. 
Hunt, Associate Enforcement Counsel, OECA, and John Seitz, Director, OAQPS, to EPA Regional 
Offices, June 13, 1989, attached as Exhibit 14. 
114 NSR Manual, pp. A.5-A.6; see Exhibit 1. 
115 In these comments, the terms “enforceable” and “enforceable as a practical matter” are used 
interchangeably.

When permits contain production or operational limits, they must also have 
requirements that allow a permitting agency to verify a source’s compliance 
with its limits. These additional conditions dictate enforceability and usually 
take the form of recordkeeping requirements.117 
 
As explained below, the proposed PSD Permit is not enforceable because it 
failed to specify monitoring requirements and did not contain adequate monitoring 
or record keeping to assure continuous compliance.  Some of the limits are also not 
enforceable because they are based on long averaging periods and/or do not include 
both an instantaneous limit and an emissions cap. 
 
A. 
The Testing for PM and PM10 Emission Limits for CTGs in the 
 
Proposed Permit Is Not Adequate to Assure Continuous 
 
Compliance 
The proposed PSD Permit limits PM and PM10 (as a surrogate for PM2.5) 
emissions from the CTGs to 12.0 lb/hr when the duct burners are off and 18.0 lb/hr 
when the duct burners are fired based on a 12-month rolling average to be verified 
with annual performance testing (stack test) and monthly natural gas fuel 
testing.118  This condition as written cannot ensure continual compliance with the 
permit limits.  According to the NSR Manual, “BACT emission limits or conditions 
must be met on a continual basis at all levels of operation (e.g., limits written in 
pounds/MMBtu or percent reduction achieved), demonstrate protection of short 
term ambient standards (limits written in pounds/hour) and be enforceable as a 
practical matter (contain appropriate averaging times, compliance verification 
procedures and recordkeeping requirements).”119  
 
A stack test normally lasts only a few hours (3 to 6 hours) and is conducted 
under ideal, prearranged conditions.  Staged annual or other periodic testing is not 
indicative of emissions during routine operation or startups and shutdowns on the 
other 364 days of the year, or 8,750-plus hours.  One 3-hour test per year over a 50-
year facility life at 85% capacity amounts to testing only about 0.04% of the 
operating hours.  Thus a stack test is not adequate to demonstrate continuous 
compliance.

Further, annual stack testing does not capture spikes caused by normal 
process operations.  It is well known that “[m]anual stack tests are generally 
performed under optimum operating conditions, and as such, do not reflect the full-
time emission conditions from a source.”120  A widely-used handbook on Continuous 
Emissions Monitoring (“CEMs”) notes, with respect to PM10 source tests, that:  “Due 
to the planning and preparations necessary for these manual methods, the source is 
usually notified prior to the actual testing.  This lead time allows the source to 
optimize both operations and control equipment performance in order to pass the 
tests.”121   
 
An annual stack test does not provide any method to assure that the BACT 
limits for PM and PM10 are met on a “continual basis.” The Permit must be revised 
to include an instantaneous permit limit in parts per million (“ppm”) and 
installation of a CEMS for PM and PM10 in the stack to address those periods when 
direct stack testing is not conducted.  Annual and quarterly stack testing of the 
CEMS should be performed to demonstrate its performance. 
 
As discussed, an annual stack test does not provide any method to assure 
that the BACT limits for PM and PM10 are met on a “continual basis.” The Permit 
should be revised to include an instantaneous permit limit (in, for example, 
lb/MMBtu) and installation of a CEMS for PM and PM10 in the stack to address 
those periods when direct stack testing is not conducted. Annual and quarterly 
stack testing of the CEMS should be performed to demonstrate its performance. 
 
B. 
The Proposed Permit Failed to Require Recordkeeping for 
 
Hours of Operation for Duct Burners 
The proposed PSD Permit restricted the combined hours of operation for both 
duct burners to 2,000 hours per year per 12-month rolling average in Condition 
C.2.122 Yet, the proposed PSD Permit failed to require any recordkeeping to ensure 
that the 2,000-hour limit for operation of both duct burners is not exceeded. The 
Proposed Permit must be revised to include a requirement for record keeping for 
operations of the two duct burners to be submitted annually to EPA.

C. 
The Proposed Permit Contained Insufficient Monitoring for 
 
Cooling Tower Emissions 
The proposed PSD Permit limited cooling tower PM emissions to 1.6 lb/hr 
based on a 0.0005% drift rate with a maximum circulation rate of 130,000 gallons 
per minute and a maximum total dissolved solids (“TDS”) content of 5,000 ppm.123  
The proposed PSD Permit required an annual source test for cooling tower PM 
emissions.124  To demonstrate continual compliance with the PM permit limit, the 
proposed PSD Permit required calculation of the mass emissions rate based on the 
TDS content determined by weekly testing of the blow-down water quality and the 
permitted circulation rate.125  The proposed PSD Permit further required that a 
maintenance procedure be established that shows how often and which procedures 
will be used to guarantee the integrity of the drift eliminators to ensure that TDS 
limits are not exceeded and to ensure compliance with recirculation rates.126  These 
requirements are insufficient to ensure continuous compliance with the proposed 
PM permit limit.  
 
The EPA must specify the proposed maintenance procedure for establishing 
the integrity of the drift eliminators in a plan subject to public review, as part of the 
permitting process and must require record keeping to assure that the procedure is 
followed.  To ensure continuous compliance with the proposed PM permit limit of 
1.6 lb/hr, it is essential to continuously monitor the cooling tower circulation rate 
and TDS in the circulating water, and to require periodic testing of PM emissions in 
the cooling tower drift rate.  
 
D. 
The Proposed Permit Contained No Restrictions on Hours of 
 
Operation and No Compliance Testing for Heater, Boiler, 
 
Emergency Use Engine, or Fire Water Pump 
The proposed PSD Permit required installation and maintenance of an 
operational non-resettable totalizing mass or volumetric flow meter in each fuel line 
for the heater (Unit D5) and the boiler (Unit D6).  In addition, the proposed PSD 
Permit required installation and maintenance of an operational non-resettable

elapsed time meter for the heater, the boiler, the emergency use engine (Unit D7), 
and the firewater pump (Unit D8).127  The proposed PSD Permit failed to restrict 
the operating hours for any of these units, thus rendering installation of the elapsed 
time meters meaningless.  
 
Emission estimates for the auxiliary boiler were based on maximum 
operation of 500 hours per year.128  Emission estimates for the auxiliary heater 
were based on maximum operation of 1,000 hours per year.129 Emission estimates 
for the emergency use engine and the fire water pump were based on maximum 
operation of 50 hours per year.130 These maximum hours of operation must be 
written into a permit condition to ensure that actual annual emissions from the 
Project do not exceed permitted annual emissions.  
 
Beyond requiring installation of the two meters, the Proposed PSD contained 
no monitoring or source testing requirements for any of these four emissions units.  
Installation of fuel and elapsed time meters alone is insufficient to ensure that 
emissions from these units would not exceed the proposed BACT limits. The 
proposed PSD Permit should be revised to contain a permit condition requiring at 
least an initial and annual source test for the heater, boiler, emergency use engine, 
and the firewater pump.  
 
VIII. THE PROJECT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE ENDANGERED 
 
SPECIES ACT 
 
 
In addition to issuing a PSD permit for the Project, EPA was also responsible 
for initiating formal consultation under the Endangered Species Act with the Fish 
and Wildlife Service (Service) for the federally threatened desert tortoise.  Under

ESA section 7, all federal agencies must initiate consultation under section 7 
whenever it undertakes an action that “may affect” a listed species or species’ 
critical habitat.131  Because the Project will affect desert tortoise, the Service’s 
formal consultation resulted in a biological opinion and incidental take statement 
issued on January 23, 2008.   
 
1. 
The Service Cannot Conclude Formal Consultation Until 
It Has Approved a Final Translocation Plan  
 
 
The biological opinion’s incidental take statement allows the City to “take” 
desert tortoise so long as the City complies with the measures described in the 
biological opinion.  The central component of the incidental take statement is the 
Service’s requirement that the City provide a translocation plan to the Service for 
its written approval prior to the onset of ground-disturbing activities.132  According 
to the biological opinion, the City can only avoid unlawful take in violation of ESA 
section 9 if it strictly adheres to a Service-approved translocation plan.133 
 
 
Unfortunately, the section 7 consultation process for the Project has been 
deeply flawed from start to finish.  First, the Service was asked and consented to 
conducting and completing the section 7 consultation process before the City even 
identified any proposed translocation site options, and well before the public 
comment period for the proposed PSD Permit.  This backward process led to the 
Service issuing its final biological opinion and the EPA issuing the proposed PSD 
Permit months before any specific translocation lands have been identified, 
approved and secured.  In this way, EPA in its PSD permitting capacity and the 
Service’s biological opinion’s cannot make a finding that only lawful take of desert 
tortoise will occur until the Serviced has a approved a final translocation plan.  The 
Service unlawfully allowed the Applicant to defer a final translocation plan until it 
begins project construction.  But the Environmental Appeals Board has held that 
ESA section 7 consultation must be concluded before issuance of the final PSD 
permit.134 This action unlawfully presupposed ESA compliance.

2. 
The Federal Agencies Are Required to Prepare NEPA Analysis  
 
 
for this Act 
 
 
Second, neither the Service nor EPA has performed any environmental 
analysis of the incidental take statement, and the decision to translocate a listed 
species.  The federal agencies must prepare an environmental impact statement 
(“EIS”) under National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  The EIS must look at 
the final translocation plan in connection with impacts to the recipient lands, 
impacts to translocated and residential desert tortoise, along with impacts to 
species and vegetation currently inhabiting the translocation lands.  Analyses of 
disease risk, site carrying capacities, food availability, and a guarantee of long term 
site management, are among the considerations that must be investigated, but are 
just examples of impact analyses required under federal law.  To date, the City has 
proposed federal, state and private land as potential translocation sites.  It is 
incumbent on the federal agencies to properly and fully evaluate all of the 
environmental impacts associated with the various options under consideration 
prior to approving a final translocation plan under ESA section 7. 
 
 
The concerns raised here are not abstract or insignificant.  On May 13, 2008, 
the Fish and Wildlife Service voiced concerns regarding the various types of 
translocation sites the City has proposed.  In effect, the Service rejected all of the 
City’s translocation options, requesting instead that the City consider translocating 
desert tortoise to areas of critical habitat within desert wildlife management 
areas.135  The problem with this option is it is directly contrary to the existing 
desert tortoise recovery plan which does not recommend translocating tortoises into 
critical habitat areas.  Given this contradiction, the Service acknowledged “that the 
existing recovery plan for the desert tortoise recommends against translocating 
desert tortoise into areas that are important for recovery (e.g., critical habitat)”.136  
Still, according to the Service, “the City of Victorville [should] strongly consider 
areas of critical habitat with desert wildlife areas as a translocation site.”137  The 
Service’s May 13 letter did not explain why it was reversing longstanding 
translocation policy, and what effect this about face may have on desert tortoise and

Supervisor, Fish and Wildlife Service, p.3  (May 13, 2008).

other environmental considerations for existing critical habitat sites.  It appears 
that the service’s translocating to critical habitat lands may be the least harmful 
option available. These issues must be investigated in an EIS subject to public and 
state agency notice and comment.  In addition, the staff biologists for the Energy 
Commission and California Department of Fish and Game also raised concerns 
regarding environmental impacts associated with the Service’s biological opinion.138 
 
 
An EIS must evaluate impacts associated with all of the various translocation 
options the City has proposed and also include a no action alternative.  The City’s 
draft translocation plan acknowledged that an EIS would be required were the 
Service to approve desert tortoise translocation to BLM lands.139  However, the 
draft translocation plan contains an impermissibly cramped interpretation of 
NEPA.  In reality, an EIS is required regardless of the particular land use 
designation of any proposed site because the Project is a major federal action under 
NEPA.140   
 
IX. 
CONCLUSION  
 
As shown above and in the supporting documents, the EPA issued its 
Completeness Determination prematurely, rendering the determination fatally 
deficient and thus invalid.  Also, the proposed PSD Permit and the supporting 
Statement of Basis must be revised to address the shortcomings described above 
and in the attached documents and re-circulated for public review.  The Fish and 
Wildlife Service cannot conclude its section 7 consultation until the Service has

Subject:  Comments Regarding the Proposed Victorville 2 Hybrid Power Project  
Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit Conditions 
 
Dear Ms. Lee, 
On behalf of the City of Victorville and Inland Energy, ENSR is submitting this letter which provides 
comments regarding the proposed Victorville 2 Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Permit for 
the Victorville 2 (VV2) Hybrid Power Project. 
1) Project Name 
In some places in the permit and the Statement of Basis and Ambient Air Quality Impact Report, the 
project is listed as the “Victorville II” project.  The project does not use a Roman numeral, and should be 
shown as the “Victorville 2 Hybrid Power Project”.   
2) Annual Facility Emission Limits 
Condition IX.A of the proposed PSD permit lists the project’s limited annual potential particulate (PM) 
emissions as 124.5 ton per year (tpy) and the particulate < 10 microns (PM10) emissions as 120.9 tpy.  
The annual facility PM and PM10 emission limits contained in the proposed PSD permit appear to be 
based on information provided in the original PSD application.  That application made the assumption 
that PM10 emissions from the cooling tower would equal 50% of the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) / PM 
emissions.  However, the supplement to the PSD application dated January 30, 2008, clarified that the 
project would assume that PM10 emissions from the cooling tower are equal to the calculated PM 
emissions.  Therefore, the PM10 emissions listed under Condition IX.A should be revised to equal 124.5 
tpy in order to be consistent with the information submitted to the EPA on January 30, 2008 and 
contained within the Final Determination of Compliance (FDOC) prepared by the Mojave Desert Air

3) Combustion Turbine Generator Emission Limits 
a. Condition IX.C.1 limits the emission rate of NOx from each combustion turbine generator (CTG) with 
duct burning to 14.6 lb/hr.  This emission rate is based on average temperature conditions, and the 
maximum rate associated with low ambient temperatures should be used for maximum hourly limits.  
Please revise this limit to 15.60 lb/hr which is the correct emission rate as presented in the FDOC. 
b. Condition IX.C.1 limits the emission rate of CO from each CTG with duct burning to 13.35 lb/hr.  
Please revise this limit to 14.25 lb/hr which is the correct emission rate as presented in the FDOC.

c. Condition IX.C.1 limits the emission rate of PM and PM10 from each combustion turbine generator 
(CTG) (no duct burning) to 12 lb/hr as a 12-month rolling average and the CTG (with duct burning) to 18 
lb/hr as a 12-month rolling average.  These limits are acceptable since they represent the approximate 
emission rates expected from the CTGs.  However, it is important to note the following items regarding 
the proposed PM10 emission limits: 
1) The proposed PM10 emission limits are lower than the CTG manufacturer’s guarantee; and 
2) The use of the Rapid Start Process (RSP) in association with the CTGs is a new technology 
and it is uncertain what impact it may have on the overall emission rates from the CTGs.  
We are not requesting a change in these limits but identifying some associated uncertainties should 
they need to be re-visited at a future date.   
d. Condition IX.C.1 limits the emission rate of CO from each CTG (no duct burning) to 7.65 lb/hr on a 
12-month rolling average.  The source of this emission limit could not be identified.  We believe that the 
correct emission rate should be 7.04 lb/hr as presented in the PSD permit application and the FDOC. 
e. Condition IX.C.2 states the following: “Combined hours of operation of both duct burners (D3 and D4) 
shall not exceed 2,000 hours per 12-month rolling average.”  The language proposed in this condition is 
not consistent with the information provided in the PSD application.  The emission calculations provided 
with the PSD application are based on each duct burner operating up to 2,000 hours per year.  In order 
to maintain maximum operational flexibility, we request that condition IX.C.2 be revised to read: 
“Combined hours of operation of both duct burners (D3 and D4) shall not exceed 4,000 hours per 12-
month rolling average.” 
4) Requirements during Gas Turbine (D1 and D2) Startup and Shutdown 
a. Condition IX.D.2 of the proposed PSD permit limits the duration of each transient event (startup and 
shutdown) associated with the CTGs.  The limits are presented in hours per event in the proposed draft 
permit.  It is requested that the limits be presented in minutes per event as shown in the following table: 
 
Duration 
Cold Startup 
110 minutes/event 
Warm and Hot Startup 
80 minutes/event 
Shutdown 
30 minutes/event 
 
 
b. Condition IX.D.2 of the proposed PSD permit proposes to limit the number of cold startups, warm and 
hot startups, and shutdowns that each CTG could perform per year.  The limit on the type of each 
operation per year appears to have been taken from the emissions calculations submitted as part of the 
original PSD permit application.  The number of each operation used in the emission calculations was 
intended only as a basis for estimating the expected transient operation emissions and should not be 
listed as limits on the operation of the facility.  The inclusion of limits on the number of these operations 
should not be required for the following reasons: 

Ms. Anita Lee, EPA Region 9 
July 7, 2008 
Page 3 
 
 
 
 
1) The facility is required to operate a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) during 
start-ups and shutdowns that will monitor the total emissions associated with these operations.  
Therefore the requirement for use of a CEMS and the inclusion of annual emission limits in the 
permit is sufficient to limit the facility’s emissions;  
2) The limit on the type of each operation unnecessarily limits operational flexibility.  For example, 
if during a given year the operating conditions dictate fewer cold startups and therefore more 
warm or hot startups, the overall facility emissions will actually be lower than estimate contained 
in the emission calculation included in the permit application; and  
3) Most permits for combined-cycle power plants within EPA Region IX do not contain such limits 
as they are an unnecessary restriction on the operation of the plant with no commensurate air 
quality benefit.   
Therefore, it is requested that the limits on the number of cold startups, warm or hot startups, and 
shutdowns be removed from the proposed permit. 
5) Auxiliary Combustion Equipment Emission Limits 
a. Condition IX.E of the proposed PSD permit limits NOx emissions from Unit D7 (2000 kW emergency 
generator) to 6.0 g/kW-hr and Unit D8 (135 kW firewater pump) to 3.8 g/kW-hr.  As presented in the 
PSD permit application, please revise Condition IX.E for Unit D7 to reflect the applicable California Tier 
2 NOx emission limit of 6.4 g/kW-hr (4.8 g/hp-hr) and Unit D8 to reflect the applicable California Tier 3 
NOx emission limit of 4.0 g/kW-hr (3.0 g/hp-hr). 
b. Condition IX.E of the proposed PSD permit for Unit D8 (firewater pump) lists Footnote 2 with the 
associated NOx emission limit.  Footnote 2 is not included in the copy of the proposed PSD permit 
provided for review. Please clarify if there is a footnote intended with this permit. 
c. Condition IX.E of the proposed PSD permit limits Unit D9 (Cooling Tower) to < 5000 ppm total 
dissolved solids (TDS).  Consistent with the PSD permit application and subsequent submittals, please 
revise this condition to read “≤ 5,000 ppm TDS”. 
d. Condition IX.E of the proposed PSD permit limits use of Unit D7 (2000 kW engine) to 50 hr/yr and 
Unit D8 (firewater pump) to “as required for fire safety testing” and “not to exceed 50 hr/yr”.  We believe 
that these restrictions do not clearly present that there cannot be restrictions on the use of the 
emergency generator or the firewater pump for emergencies.  To clarify this restriction, we request that 
the proposed language be revised to read: “Maintenance and fire safety testing shall not exceed 50 
hr/yr” for both Unit D7 and Unit D8. 
6) Cooling Tower Emission Limits 
Condition IX.F.2 states the following: The maximum hourly total PM emission rate from the cooling 
tower and the evaporative condenser shall not exceed 1.6 lb/hr.”  The proposed project does not include 
an evaporative condenser emission unit.  We request that this condition be revised to read as follows: 
“The maximum hourly total PM emission rate from the cooling tower shall not exceed 1.6 lb/hr.” 
 

Ms. Anita Lee, EPA Region 9 
July 7, 2008 
Page 4 
 
 
 
 
7) Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) for Units D1 and D2 
a. Condition IX.G.5 states the following: “The CEMS shall be certified and tested in accordance with 
Condition IX.G.7. We do not understand the reason for the inclusion of this condition.  We believe that 
Conditions IX.G.6 and IX.G.7 are adequate with regard to the certification and testing of the CEMS.  
Therefore, we request that condition IX.G.5 be removed from the proposed permit. 
b. We request that Condition IX.G.6 be revised as follows: “The initial certification of the CEMS may 
either be conducted separately, or as specified in 40 CFR 60.334(b)(1), or as part of the initial 
performance test of each emission unit.  CEMS must undergo and pass initial certification testing on or 
before the date of the initial performance test. 
c. Condition IX.G.9 requires that “The gas turbine CEMS shall be tested annually and quarterly in 
accordance with 40 CFR Part 60 Appendix F, Procedure 1.”  40 CFR Part 60 Appendix F, Procedure 1 
requires that a CEMS be audited quarterly with at least one Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) being 
completed every 4 quarters.  We believe that the proposed language should be clarified by revising it to 
read as follows: “The gas turbine CEMS shall be audited quarterly and tested annually in accordance 
with 40 CFR Part 60 Appendix F, Procedure 1. 
d. Condition IX.G.10 states that: “Permittee shall submit a CEMS performance test protocol to the EPA 
not later than 30 days prior to the test date…”.  We request that this portion of Condition IX.G.10 be 
revised to read: “Permittee shall submit a CEMS certification test plan to the EPA no later than 30 days 
prior to the test date…”. 
8) Performance Tests 
a. Condition IX.H.1.a.iii and iv of the proposed PSD permit requires that the 2,000 kW engine (Unit D7) 
and the firewater pump (Unit D8) complete initial and annual performance tests for NOx, CO, PM, and 
PM10 (as a surrogate for PM2.5).  We believe that the performance testing requirement contained in 
this condition is excessive for emission units that are limited to 50 hours per year of non-emergency 
operation and will be certified by the engine manufacturer to meet the emission standards.  Therefore, 
we request that the requirement for annual testing of these units be deleted.  Source testing would take 
additional time over what is needed for the normal testing (i.e., starting the engine to make sure that it is 
in operating condition, per Fire Department safety requirements), and hence if EPA does require such 
testing, it would require the engine to be run for more than 50 hr/yr for non-emergency purposes, which 
would then make the engine no longer exempt from California emission limits for diesel engines.   
b. Condition IX.H.1.a.v of the proposed PSD permit requires initial and annual PM testing from the 
cooling tower.  After submittal of the PSD application, the Applicant’s consultant, Ms. Sara Head, had 
several discussions with Mr. Ed Pike of the EPA.  Mr. Pike indicated that source testing of the cooling 
tower would only be required if an assumption that less than 100% of the TDS in the tower was 
assumed to be emitted as PM10.  Therefore, it was agreed that the PM10 (and PM2.5) emissions from 
the cooling tower would be assumed to equal the PM emissions (see comment 2 above).  This 
assumption was used in the subsequent supplemental submittals related to PM and PM2.5 emissions 
for the VV2 Project.  Therefore, the requirement to source test the cooling tower should be deleted from 
the permit.    
c. Condition IX.H.1.b of the proposed PSD permit states: “The annual performance tests shall be 
conducted in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 

Ms. Anita Lee, EPA Region 9 
July 7, 2008 
Page 5 
 
 
 
 
5.11.”.  Appendix F, Procedure 1 does not contain a Section 5.11.  In addition, we do not see the 
applicability of Appendix F, Procedure 1 (QA Requirements for CEMS) to the performance test 
requirements of Section H of the proposed permit.  We request that Condition IX.H.1.b be removed from 
the permit. 
d. Condition IX.H.1.f of the proposed PSD permit states: “The performance methods specified in 
Condition X.F.3 may be modified as follows:”.  The proposed PSD permit does not contain condition 
X.F.3. The language of Condition IX.H.1.f.i and ii appear to be similar to 40 CFR 60.4405 which is 
applicable to performance of the initial certification testing required by 40 CFR 60 Subpart KKKK for a 
CTG that has selected to install a NOx CEMS. Therefore, we believe that Condition IX.H.1.f should be 
revised to read: “The performance methods specified in Condition IX.H.1.d.i and ii may be modified as 
follows:” or removed from the proposed permit. 
e. Condition IX.H.3.a of the proposed PSD permit states the following: “Permittee shall take monthly 
samples of the natural gas combusted….”  The requirements of 40 CFR 60 Subpart KKKK allow the 
approval of custom fuel monitoring schedule approved by EPA for compliance with the fuel monitoring 
provisions.  We believe that the fuel data that will be provided by the gas supplier will be sufficient to 
provide the necessary information.  Therefore, we request that this condition be revised for consistency 
with the FDOC to allow that sulfur content of natural gas combusted at the facility shall be obtained by 
the Permittee through laboratory analysis or natural gas sulfur content reports from the natural gas 
supplier(s). 
We appreciate your consideration of these comments.  For your convenience, we have also provided 
these comments as a mark-up of the proposed PSD permit.  Please contact me at 805-388-3775 if you 
have any questions about these comments regarding the proposed PSD permit for the VV2 Project.

To Shaheerah Kelly, 
 
Thank you for speaking with me today regarding the COLUSA GENERATING STATION PSD 
Permit. I would like to submit comments (including these) but only recently discovered the 
action. I think that I have demonstrated an interest in PSD permits (see EAD remand 08-
01 et al) I have repeatedly asked to to be added to Region 9 interested parties list (below) 
I have no record of having received notice of the original permitting or this modification. 
Did you send me Notice of this action? I am presently preparing comments for the 
Humboldt Bay repower project PSD permit and the Avenal PSD permit.I do not have 
sufficiant time to promote participation and effectively comment on this action in the 
remaining time under the present notice. Please extend the comment period by 45 days so 
that I can participate. It appears that the intent of the notice was to accept comments only 
relative to the ""proposed permit revision"" is this correct? Can you direct me to the 
Authority for this limitation it feels picemeal or bifurcated. I would like to comment on the 
entire permit. Can you also inform me of, if this revision includes an extension of the 
permit term or when does the permit expire?  
 
Thank You,

Mr. Simpson (510-909-1800),  
 
Thank you for your patience in receipt of this summary.  
 
As mentioned, the following is my understanding of the information you expressed (regarding 
the Avenal Energy Project)  in your call to me this afternoon. If there are corrections or 
clarifications you would like to make to this information, please ""reply all"" so that my manager, 
Mr. Gerardo Rios (415-972-3974), also has the benefit of receiving that information.  
 
a) Process to file a complaint with EPA: You have a question - What is the process to file a 
complaint with the EPA? (You would like to file a complaint that addresses your issues of 
concern. See below.)  
 
b) Issues of concern: The concern you expressed is that the San Joaquin Valley Unified 
APCD, for the issuance of its PDOC, did not properly follow what you understand to be the 
requirements for public notification of the Clean Air Act requirements (e.g., 40 CFR Part 
51.166?). By not doing so, you noted that this did not provide for informed public participation. 
Furthermore, you also are concerned that the FDOC was not issued in a manner that makes it 
a valid document; therefore, the PSD process should not rely on the FDOC for information.  
 
c) Contact with San Joaquin Valley APCD - You have already contacted the APCD, and 
they are not going to reopen the DOC process.  
 
And as noted, we will add your name and email address to our notification list for PSD permits. 
 
 
Best regards,

To Shaheerah kelly, 
 
Regarding  Colusa PSD permit Modification.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Colusa PSD permit modification EPA-
R09-OAR-2009-0697 . As I mentioned in my previous communication I ""only recently 
discovered the action. I think that I have demonstrated an interest in PSD permits (see 
EAD remand 08-01 et al) I have repeatedly asked to to be added to Region 9 interested 
parties list (below) I have no record of having received notice of the original permitting 
or this modification. Did you send me Notice of this action? I am presently preparing 
comments for the Humboldt Bay repower project PSD permit and the Avenal PSD 
permit. I do not have sufficient time to promote participation and effectively comment on 
this action in the remaining time under the present notice. Please extend the comment 
period by 45 days so that I can participate.  It appears that this modification (while not 
disclosed in the public notice) appears to constitute an extension of the 18 month 
commencement of construction deadline found in 40 CFR 52.21 and so it should be 
disclosed as such in the public notice and be processed consistent with ""EPA Region IX 
Policy on PSD Permit Extensions Dated September 8, 1988 
 http://www.epa.gov/Region7/programs/artd/air/nsr/nsrmemos/extnsion.pdf 
 
This permit appears to be based upon a PSD application which was received by Region 9  
 on December 22,2006. This data appears to be outdated. It appears that comments were 
received from CARE then withdrawn on the original permit after some settlement with 
CARE.  I hereby submit those comments of CARE as my own at this time. It appears that 
greenhouse gases were not adequately analyzed for the original permit or the 
modification.   
 
 
BACT 
 
CO BACT WATER BATH HEATER 
 
       The Colusa Generating Station Water Bath Heater is expected to emit CO at 100 
parts per million by volume dry (ppmvd).   Seven sources have lower CO emission rates 
than the CGS's fuel gas heater, ranging from 27 to 72 ppmvd.1  The AES Puerto Rico 
Cogen application # PR-007 has a limestone dryer with an emission rate of 27 PPM @3% 
O2 for CO.   The BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc, Milne Point Production application 
Number AK-047 also  has an emission rate of 27 PPM @3% O2 for CO.  South Cal Gas 
application number SCAQMD AN: 347641 has an emission rate of 50 ppm @ 3% O2 for 
CO.  Norton Energy Storage, LLC application # OH-0264 has a CO emission rate of 53

ppm @ 3% O2 for CO which has been verified in practice.  The PSD permit must adopt a 
lower limit for CO emissions for the Water Bath heater.  
 
NOX BACT WATER BATH HEATER 
 
The Colusa Generating Station Water Bath Heater is expected to emit NOx at 30  parts 
per million by volume dry (ppmvd).  Based on a review of the EPA's 
RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, California Air Resources Board Statewide Best 
Available Control Technology (BACT) Clearinghouse, and the San Joaquin Valley Air 
Pollution Control Districts Best Available Control Technology (BACT) Clearinghouse 
there are  4 sources which report a lower NOx emission rate than the CGS WBH, ranging 
from 9 to 20 ppmvd of NOx.  NELCO Products, force circulation oil heater, application 
number SCAQMD AN: 371784 has a 12ppm @ 3% O2 emission rate.  South Cal Gas, 
heater, application # SCAQMD AN: 347641, has a 20 ppm @ 3% O2 emission rate for  
NOx.  The SJVUAPCD BACT clearinghouse lists tow BACT determinations of 9 ppm 
and 12 ppm as BACT for NOx emissions from a pre heater.2 
 
BASELINE EMISSIONS 
 
     According to Ambient Air Quality Impact Report for the Colusa Generating Station,  
Clean Air Act  Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit  Permit No. SAC 06-01 
dated May of 2008, the modification of the CGS triggers the adjustment of baseline 
emissions to include the adjacent Delevan compressor Station.  As stated in the 2008 
permit:  
 
       “As shown in Figure 4-1, CGS will be located near the Delevan Compressor Station 
(DCS), an existing natural gas compressor station that is also owned and operated by 
PG&E and located west of Glenn-Colusa Bridge and Dirks Road. The facility will be 
fueled by natural gas delivered from DCS to the site via a new 8 inch, 1,500-foot natural 
gas pipeline owned and operated by PG&E. Since CGS and DCS (1) will both be owned 
by PG&E (under common control), (2) have the same 2-digit Standard Industrial 
Classification (4911 for CGS and 4922 for DCS; Major Group 49, Electric, Gas, and 
Sanitary Services), and (3) will be located on contiguous or adjacent properties and 
physically connected by a pipeline, both facilities will be considered a single source for 
Title V purposes. Designation of these two facilities as a single source does not affect the 
current PSD evaluation. If the source is subsequently modified, however, the source’s 
“baseline actual emissions” under 40 CFR 52.21(b)(48) will comprise emissions from 
both facilities (CGS and DCS).”3

 Ambient Air Quality Impact Report  Colusa Generating Station  Clean Air Act  Prevention of Significant 
Deterioration Permit  Permit No. SAC 06-01  page 7 

  
 
      The PG&E Delevan compressor Station has NOx emissions of 356 tons per year.4  
That Delevan compressor Station combined with the CGS will emit 540 tons per year of 
NOx on adjacent parcels owned and operated by PG&E connected by a common 
pipeline.   That equates to 1.47 tons per day of NOx emissions from the same company 
PG&E.   The combined projects emissions must be included in the soils and vegetation 
analysis to determine if there are any significant impacts to biological and agricultural 
resources.  The original nitrogen deposition analysis did not include both facilities and 
did not include nitrogen deposition impacts from the projects 159 tons per year of 
ammonia emissions.  The ammonia emissions will have a larger impact than the project 
Nox emissions.   
 
 
 BIOLOGICLA IMPACTS 
 
The AMBIENT AIR QUALITY IMPACT REPORT  for the Colusa Generating 
Station PSD Permit No.: SAC 06-01 states on page 5: 
 
Because the proposed equipment changes will not result in any new construction outside 
the current footprint of the facility, and will reduce CGS’s facility-wide emissions of all 
pollutants covered by the Permit, EPA concludes that the proposed changes will not 
affect listed species in a manner that was not considered in the BO. By e-mail on August 
13, 2009, FWS confirmed that no additional ESA consultation is required for this 
project.5 
 
       The applicant has recently filed an amendment at the CEC to, “to request the CEC's 
approval to amend the CGS project description to allow slight modification of the size 
and layout of the switchyard and the electric transmission interconnection route.6   The 
CEC final decision approved a total of 12 new towers, four on site (within the 100 acre 
parcel and eight offsite.  The applicant’s new proposal will add a total of 20 new towers 
with eight on site and 12 offsite.   As stated on page 2-2 of the amendment, “Construction 
of the new towers has the potential to slightly increase permanent impacts to Swainson's 
hawk foraging habitat.”7   “The reconfigured switchyard/substation will result in an

additional 0.87 acre of disturbance of annual grassland. The two project component 
changes will result in a total of 1.15 acres of additional impacts to annual grassland 
beyond what was originally permitted in the CEC's Final Decision for the CGS project.” 8   
The Biological opinion did not include impacts and mitigation for the Swainson hawk.  
The May 2008 SOB states the conclusions of the Biological assessment: 
 
“On March 14, 2008, the Service issued its biological opinion. According to the biological 
opinion, the Service determined that the proposed project was likely to directly affect the 
federally-listed vernal pool tadpole shrimp (Lepidurus packardi) and vernal pool fairy 
shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi), and permanently affect the giant garter snake (Thamnophis 
gigas). In the biological opinion, the Service discusses various conservation measures 
proposed by PG&E, and the biological opinion also specifies PG&E’s conservation 
responsibilities, including purchase of vernal pool preservation and creation credits at a 
Service-approved conservation bank and purchase of giant garter snake habitat credits from 
a mitigation bank approved by the Service and the California Department of Fish and 
Game.”9 
 
 
     The original biological opinion did not consider impacts or provide mitigation for 
impacts to the Swainson hawk.   Neither the original biological opinion nor the current 
SOB has analyzed the impacts from the placement of six new transmission towers or the

“A natural-gas fired auxiliary boiler will be installed to facilitate plant starts.” 

removing the boiler the SOB needs to evaluate the impact and BACT for startup and 
shutdowns times and emissions.  The project startup and shutdown emissions create the 
largest air quality impacts for the project.  Current times for startup and shutdown do not 
meet BACT requirements for startup and shutdown emissions.  Combined cycle turbines 
are currently being permitted which can achieve cold, warm, and hot starts taking no 
longer than 1-hour to demonstrate compliance with normal steady state emission limits.13  
These fast start machines are now being utilized in most new power plant applications 
such as the new proposed Contra Costa Generating Plant, the Willow Pass Generating 
Station and the Marsh Landing Project.   The Contra Costa Generating Station utilizing a 
GE Model 7FA with fast start capability is capable of achieving cold starts in one hour 
with only 96 pounds of NO2 emissions as illustrated on page 5.1-9, table 5.16, of the 
AFC. 14    
     Similarly the Marsh Landing Facility employing Siemens Flex Plant 10 (FP10) 
technology is capable of startup times of less than 12 minutes and worst case startup 
emissions  of  38.7 pounds for NO2 and  279.8 pounds per hour for CO emissions for a 
cold start. 15     
      Also the Willow Pass Generating stations expected emissions associated with CTG 
Cold startup and shutdown event is 38.7 pounds of NO2 and 279.8 pounds of CO.  Based 
on vendor information, startup (i.e., the period from initial firing to compliance with 
emission limits) of the FP10 units is expected to occur within 12 minutes. During a 
shutdown event, the efficiency of the emission controls will continue to function at 
normal operating levels down to a load of 60 percent for the FP10 units; thus, shutdown 
periods and emissions are measured from the time this load is reached.16

projects PM 2.5 ambient air quality impact change from 2.73 ug/m3 in the original FDOC 
to 3.3 ug/m3 with the projects modifications triggering an assessment of the project PM 
2.5 impacts under the new EPA PM 2.5 regulations.   The May 2008 SOB states: 
“Consistent with existing EPA policy, PSD review of PM10 emissions will serve as a 
surrogate for review of PM2.5 emissions while EPA continues to work through the 
significant technical difficulties associated with integrating the new PM2.5 standard into 
the PSD program.”   EPA has decided to repeal its recently adopted provision in  
40 C.F.R. 52.21 (i) (1) (xi) that directs permitting agencies to use the so called surrogate 
approach in addressing PM 2.5 compliance issues.  The PSD analysis must now 
demonstrate that the facility will use BACT to control PM 2.5 emissions and conduct an 
Air Quality Impact Analysis showing that the facility will not contribute to an 
exceedance of the PM 2.5 NAAQS for annual and 24 hour standards.  
 
 
SHAM PERMIT 
 
The permit reduces hourly PM 2.5 emission form the project from 20 pounds per hour to  
13.5 pounds per hour.  This is an administrative change as no new pollution control 
equipment or operating changes are being proposed.  The permit fails to establish a basis 
for these reductions and they appear to lower the projects PM 2.5 emission to address the 
project’s exceedence of  the 5% FLAG level of concern for visibility at the Yolla Bolly-
Middle Eel Wilderness Area. 
 
 
 
 ""A Sham permit is when a source pursues a permit limit on the potential to emit (PTE) 
for a proposed project in order to limit the source to minor source levels as a means of 
circumventing the requirements of NSR. Most often this term applies to construction 
permits when a company wants to expedite commencement of construction so they are 
willing to take what they consider temporary limits on PTE such that the proposed project 
is a not required to undergo NSR, and therefore they can get their permit without any of 
the NSR associated delays. The company's intent in such cases would be to remove the 
limiting permit conditions prior to normal operation, or shortly thereafter (e.g., request a 
revision to the permit, appeal the permit). 
Another circumstance which may occur is when a major project is broken up into several 
smaller minor projects in order to avoid NSR requirements. 
The USEPA's has expressed that a company should fully address the means of both initial 
and future compliance in the pre-construction permit application, that a complete review 
be performed, and the means of compliance determined prior to the issuance of a permit. 
The means and costs of continuous compliance should be part of the company's business 
decision when determining whether or not to construct.

Colusa PSD comments
A recurring concern that I have with PSD permits is failure to provide for public 
participation.  My hope was that the Russell City Energy Center EPA 
Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) Remand provided guidance that would be 
followed in permitting polluters.  Environmental Appeals Judges Edward E. Reich,
Charles J. Sheehan, and Anna L. Wolgast held that:
(3) While the Board generally will not consider notice allegations in a
petition where the sole deficiency alleged is failure to give notice to
a particular person other than the petitioner, it nevertheless regards
it as appropriate to consider claims of failure of notice to other
persons within the scope of allegations of fundamental defects in the
integrity of the notice process as a whole that may be prejudicial to
the notice rights of the petitioner and others.
2
Furthermore, conferring standing in a restrictive manner would be at odds with clear
Congressional direction for “informed public participation,” see CAA
§ 160(5), 42 U.S.C. § 7470(5), and § 124.10’s expansive provision of
notice and participation rights to members of the public. This is
illustrated by the requirement for permitting agencies to implement
general outreach by compiling mailing lists of persons interested in
permitting actions, see 40 C.F.R. § 124.10(c)(1)(ix)(A)-(C), and the
statement elsewhere in part 124 that “any interested person may submit
written comments on the draft permit.” Id. § 124.11 (emphasis added).
26
Moreover, given the pivotal importance to Congress
of providing adequate initial notice within EPA’s public participation
regime under 40 C.F.R. part 124, see supra Part IV.B.,
38
I have found no evidence of a public Notice for this facility that includes the 
information needed for ""informed public participation"" which is a demonstration of 
the projects effects on air quality in relationship to the National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards. The amendment Notices that I have seen include no 
indication of the volume of pollutants. Original Notices for the facility appear to 
include a gross weight of pollutants but no basis in relationship to air quality. I 
found no evidence that Region 9 incorporated the interested parties lists from the 
CEC proceeding or the Air Districts proceeding. I found no evidence the Notice 
was provided to the County Supervisors or other required government officials. I 
have seen no evidence of outreach or development of lists of potentially 
interested individuals, organizations or agencies. 
I have found no evidence of greenhouse gas considerations. I would like to 
understand what greenhouse gases will be emitted, understand if the EPA 
considers them subject to regulation and comment.  I recall no response to my 
previous inquiries regarding this facility. This process would seem to discourage 
public participation. While the polluters appear to enjoy unbridled cooperation 
even the  Remand from the EAB has not encouraged regulators to respond to 
the public. If the public was aware of the effects of this plant they through some 

outreach they would likely be interested. After the Remand where the Air District 
claimed there was no interest or comments on the PSD permit the Air District has 
now received close to 1000 responses. I have been commenting on PSD permits 
but never recall receiving a substantive response to my comments. I certainly do 
not have the expertise or resources to participate to a degree that other 
organizations have in other PSD permits. If the other organizations that have 
participated in other PSD permits in the region received Notice of this proceeding 
they may participate. 
BACT
CO BACT WATER BATH HEATER
       The Colusa Generating Station Water Bath Heater is expected to emit CO at 
100 parts per million by volume dry (ppmvd).   Seven sources have lower CO 
emission rates than the CGS's fuel gas heater, ranging from 27 to 72 ppmvd.1 
The AES Puerto Rico Cogen application # PR-007 has a limestone dryer with an 
emission rate of 27 PPM @3% O2 for CO.   The BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc, 
Milne Point Production application Number AK-047 also  has an emission rate of 
27 PPM @3% O2 for CO.  South Cal Gas application number SCAQMD AN: 
347641 has an emission rate of 50 ppm @ 3% O2 for CO.  Norton Energy 
Storage, LLC application # OH-0264 has a CO emission rate of 53 ppm @ 3% 
O2 for CO which has been verified in practice.  The PSD permit must adopt a 
lower limit for CO emissions for the Water Bath heater. 
NOX BACT WATER BATH HEATER
The Colusa Generating Station Water Bath Heater is expected to emit NOx at 30 
parts per million by volume dry (ppmvd).  Based on a review of the EPA's RACT/
BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, California Air Resources Board Statewide Best 
Available Control Technology (BACT) Clearinghouse, and the San Joaquin 
Valley Air Pollution Control Districts Best Available Control Technology (BACT) 
Clearinghouse there are  4 sources which report a lower NOx emission rate than 
the CGS WBH, ranging from 9 to 20 ppmvd of NOx.  NELCO Products, force 
circulation oil heater, application number SCAQMD AN: 371784 has a 12ppm @ 
3% O2 emission rate.  South Cal Gas, heater, application # SCAQMD AN: 
347641, has a 20 ppm @ 3% O2 emission rate for  NOx.  The SJVUAPCD BACT 
clearinghouse lists tow BACT determinations of 9 ppm and 12 ppm as BACT for 
NOx emissions from a pre heater.2

     According to Ambient Air Quality Impact Report for the Colusa Generating 
Station,  Clean Air Act  Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit  Permit No. 
SAC 06-01 dated May of 2008, the modification of the CGS triggers the 
adjustment of baseline emissions to include the adjacent Delevan compressor 
Station.  As stated in the 2008 permit: 

       “As shown in Figure 4-1, CGS will be located near the Delevan 
Compressor Station (DCS), an existing natural gas compressor 
station that is also owned and operated by PG&E and located west of 
Glenn-Colusa Bridge and Dirks Road. The facility will be fueled by 
natural gas delivered from DCS to the site via a new 8 inch, 1,500-
foot natural gas pipeline owned and operated by PG&E. Since CGS 
and DCS (1) will both be owned by PG&E (under common control), 
(2) have the same 2-digit Standard Industrial Classification (4911 for 
CGS and 4922 for DCS; Major Group 49, Electric, Gas, and 
Sanitary Services), and (3) will be located on contiguous or adjacent 
properties and physically connected by a pipeline, both facilities will 
be considered a single source for Title V purposes. Designation of 
these two facilities as a single source does not affect the current PSD 
evaluation. If the source is subsequently modified, however, the 
source’s “baseline actual emissions” under 40 CFR 52.21(b)(48) 
will comprise emissions from both facilities (CGS and DCS) ).”3 The 
PSD regulations define a ""building, structure, facility, or 
installation,"" for source definition and emissions accounting 
purposes, as follows: "". . . all of the pollutant-emitting activities 
which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on 
one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the 
control of the same person (or persons under common 
control) . . . Pollutant-emitting activities shall be considered as 
part of the same industrial grouping if they belong to the same 
""Major Group"" (which have the same two-digit code) as 
described in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual . . .""

ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT  BIOLOGICAL IMPACTS
The AMBIENT AIR QUALITY IMPACT REPORT  for the Colusa Generating 
Station PSD Permit No.: SAC 06-01 states on page 5:
Because the proposed equipment changes will not result in any new construction outside 
the current footprint of the facility, and will reduce CGS’s facility-wide emissions of all 
pollutants covered by the Permit, EPA concludes that the proposed changes will not 
affect listed species in a manner that was not considered in the BO. By e-mail on August 
13, 2009, FWS confirmed that no additional ESA consultation is required for this 
project.4
       The applicant has recently filed an amendment at the CEC to, “to request the 
CEC's approval to amend the CGS project description to allow slight modification 
of the size and layout of the switchyard and the electric transmission 
interconnection route.5   The CEC final decision approved a total of 12 new 
towers, four on site (within the 100 acre parcel and eight offsite.  The applicant’s 
new proposal will add a total of 20 new towers with eight on site and 12 offsite. 
As stated on page 2-2 of the amendment, “Construction of the new towers has 
the potential to slightly increase permanent impacts to Swainson's hawk foraging 
habitat.”6   “The reconfigured switchyard/substation will result in an additional 
0.87 acre of disturbance of annual grassland. The two project component 
changes will result in a total of 1.15 acres of additional impacts to 
annualgrassland beyond what was originally permitted in the CEC's Final 
Decision for the CGS project.” 7   The Biological opinion did not include impacts 
and mitigation for the Swainson hawk.  The May 2008 SOB states the 
conclusions of the Biological assessment:
“On March 14, 2008, the Service issued its biological opinion. According to the biological 
opinion, the Service determined that the proposed project was likely to directly affect the 
federally-listed vernal pool tadpole shrimp (Lepidurus packardi) and vernal pool fairy 
shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi), and permanently affect the giant garter snake (Thamnophis 
gigas). In the biological opinion, the Service discusses various conservation measures 
proposed by PG&E, and the biological opinion also specifies PG&E’s conservation 
responsibilities, including purchase of vernal pool preservation and creation credits at a 
Service-approved conservation bank and purchase of giant garter snake habitat credits from

a mitigation bank approved by the Service and the California Department of Fish and 
Game.”8
     The original biological opinion did not consider impacts or provide mitigation 
for impacts to the Swainson hawk.   Neither the original biological opinion nor the 
current SOB has analyzed the impacts from the placement of six new 
transmission towers or the realignment of the original transmission towers. 
Consultation with the USFWS must be reinitiated and completed before approval 
of PSD permit per 50 CFR Section 402.1 (3).9
      The applicant’s addition of the WSAC Unit will increase operational water use 
by 21 Acre feet per year from 130 AFY to 151 AFY.   The applicant’s agreement 
with the Glen-Colusa Water District guarantees 130 AFY for the project but any 
additional water is subject to the water shortage provisions in Article 9A of the 
agreement.10  The implications of the additional water usage and its impact on 
the environment should be discussed in the SOB. 
REMOVAL OF THE AUXILLARY BOILER
    The original PSD permit included an Auxiliary Boiler.  According to the applicant, 
“A natural gas-fired auxiliary boiler rated at 44 million BTU/hr will be included to 
provide steam to shorten the time required for plant starts.”11  Since the applicant is 
removing the boiler the SOB needs to evaluate the impact and BACT for startup and 
shutdowns times and emissions.  Start up and shutdown The application describes 
emissions from facility start up and shutdown, but does not report the modeled 
impact of those operating conditions. Start up and shutdown conditions should be 
modeled to ensure no PSD increment or NAAQS is violated.     The projects 
startup and shutdown emissions create the largest air quality impacts for the project. 
Current times for startup and shutdown do not meet BACT requirements for startup and 
shutdown emissions.  Combined cycle turbines are currently being permitted which can 
achieve cold, warm, and hot starts taking no longer than 1-hour to demonstrate 
compliance with normal steady state emission limits.12  These fast start machines are now

being utilized in most new power plant applications such as the new proposed Contra 
Costa Generating Plant, the Willow Pass Generating Station and the Marsh Landing 
Project.   The Contra Costa Generating Station utilizing a GE Model 7FA with fast start 
capability is capable of achieving cold starts in one hour with only 96 pounds of NO2 
emissions as illustrated on page 5.1-9, table 5.16, of the AFC. 13   
     Similarly the Marsh Landing Facility employing Siemens Flex Plant 10 (FP10) 
technology is capable of startup times of less than 12 minutes and worst case 
startup emissions  of  38.7 pounds for NO2 and  279.8 pounds per hour for CO 
emissions for a cold start. 14    
      Also the Willow Pass Generating stations expected emissions associated 
with CTG Cold startup and shutdown event is 38.7 pounds of NO2 and 279.8 
pounds of CO.  Based on vendor information, startup (i.e., the period from initial 
firing to compliance with emission limits) of the FP10 units is expected to occur 
within 12 minutes. During a shutdown event, the efficiency of the emission 
controls will continue to function at normal operating levels down to a load of 60 
percent for the FP10 units; thus, shutdown periods and emissions are measured 
from the time this load is reached.15 
     The EPA in a recent consent decree with PG&E has required fast start

project to meet lower startup and shut down times and emissions since they are allowing 
removal of the auxiliary Boiler which was installed “to provide steam to shorten the time 
required for plant starts.”   Startup and Shutdown emission rates are much greater than 
steady state emissions for NOx and CO1  therefore, BACT FOR NOx emitted during 
startup and shutdown is not covered by the steady· state NOx Top-Down Analysis. Since 
BACT is triggered for NOx, an analysis of BACT for NOx during startup is required. The 
following possible control technologies could be utilized:
1. GE OpFlex Startup NOx
GE OpFlex Startup NOx and Startup Fuel Heating system is a series of
enhancements designed to expand the operating profile of gas turbines while
maintaining or lowering emissions. The OpFlex Startup NOx system uses 
proprietary GE advanced fuel scheduling technology to reduce startup and 
shutdown NOx emissions. This technology has been used to limit gas turbine 
emissions to less than 25 ppm at the turbine outlet (prior to controls).
2. GE Rapid Response Technology
GE offers its ""Rapid· Response"" technology that reduces startup time of the 
turbine and startup NOx and CO emissions. This system allows the gas turbines 
in a combined cycle plant to startup in a similar process as a simple cycle unit. 
The typical gas turbine at a combined cycle plant will initially fire and ramp up to
approximately 20% load. The turbine is then be held at 20% load while the steam
systems are slowly brought online. This method of starting up the system is slow,
since the operator must avoid ramping the temperature up to fast which can 
cause stress cracks in the system from thermal expansion. This hold at 20% load 
increases  the time that the system spends in startup mode.
Rapid Response accomplishes a faster startup by breaking the startup of the gas
turbine free of the steam cycle. The system is equipped with a steam bypass that
allows the hot exhausts to circumvent the steam cycle during startup, allowing 
the turbine to ramp up directly to nearly 100% load. This method of operating the 
unit allows the gas turbine to sync to the power grid within approximately 10 
minutes of ignition. The steam cycle is then gradually brought online while the 
unit is synched to the power grid.
The key elements of the GE Rapid Response package are:
a. A Power Island Integrated System Controller
b. An HRSG designed to handle loading ramp rate of the gas turbines
c. A hybrid steam bypass system designed to accept 100% of the gas turbine
load during startup

d. Steam control and valve modifications
e. Purge credit for gas turbines (purge cycle is activated on shutdown instead of
during startup)
f. A startup gas turbine fuel heating system that is independent of the HRSG
AIR QUALITY IMPACTS
      Page 4 of the SOB for the project states,” The PSD regulations require an 
ambient air quality impact analysis to determine the impacts of the proposed 
project on ambient air quality and nearby Class I areas. For all regulated 
pollutants emitted in significant quantities, the analysis must consider whether 
the proposed project will cause a violation of (1) the applicable PSD increments, 
or (2) the NAAQS. EPA conducted this analysis as part of our prior permitting 
action. See Sections 8 and 9 of the Ambient Air Quality Impact Report for the 
proposed PSD permit issued for public comment in May 2008 (AAQIR). EPA 
conducted these modeling analyses using “worst case assumptions” for all 
subject pollutants, e.g., startup and shutdown emission rates or maximum 
allowable annual emissions. Id. At 36. Because the proposed revisions to the 
Permit do not alter any of these assumptions and will reduce the facility-wide 
emission limits for all pollutants covered by the Permit, these changes do not 
require a reevaluation of our prior air quality impacts analysis.
       While the project has proposed a reduction in PM 2.5 emissions the change 
in the physical configuration has led to higher ambient air concentrations for PM 
2.5.16   The projects PM 2.5 ambient air quality impact changed from 2.73 
ug/m317 in the original FDOC to 3.3 ug/m3 with the projects modifications 
triggering an assessment of the project s PM 2.5 impacts under the new EPA PM 
2.5 regulations.   The May 2008 SOB states: “Consistent with existing EPA 
policy, PSD review of PM10 emissions will serve as a surrogate for review of 
PM2.5 emissions while EPA continues to work through the significant technical 
difficulties associated with integrating the new PM2.5 standard into the PSD 
program.”  Accordingly the EPA never examined PM 2.5 ambient air Quialty 
impacts in the 2008 SOB.  EPA has decided to repeal its recently adopted 
provision in  40 C.F.R. 52.21 (i) (1) (xi) that directs permitting agencies to use the 
so called surrogate approach in addressing PM 2.5 compliance issues.  The 
2009 PSD analysis must now demonstrate that the facility will use BACT to 
control PM 2.5 emissions and conduct an Air Quality Impact Analysis showing 
that the facility will not contribute to an exceedance of the PM 2.5 NAAQS for 
annual and 24 hour standards.

     The SOB relies on the applicant’s assessment for nitrogen deposition that 
was presented in the applicant’s 2006 PSD permit application.  A review of the 
applicant’s analysis demonstrates that the applicant did  not include nitrogen 
deposition impacts from the projects ammonia emissions which has much larger 
impacts than the NO2 or SO2 emissions.  Therefore the EPA analysis is 
defective since the projects 159 tons a year of ammonia emissions will create 
much larger nitrogen deposition impacts than the projects other NO2 and So2 
emissions. 
Applicant Compliance Record
     CCAPCD Rule 3.6 (c) 7 requires that “The owner or operator of a proposed 
new or modified source shall to the satisfaction of the APCO that all major 
stationary sources owned or operated by such person (or by an controlling,

with all applicable emission limitations and standards.  
      PG&E owns a facility in Contra Costa County the Gateway Generating 
Station that is currently undergoing compliance review at the California Energy 
Commission.  The project is the subject of an FNOV and a proposed consent 
decree which is undergoing a public comment period.18  At the present time the 
project is not in compliance with State and Federal Air Quality Regulations and 
will not be in compliance until the activities required by the consent decree are 
completed.  The project’s PSD permit cannot be approved until the project owner 
PG&E completes the requirements of the consent decree and comes into 
compliance with these new air quality requirements.

Re: 
Comments of Sierra Club on the Proposed Redesignation of Kewaunee 
County from Nonattainment to Attainment of the 8-hour National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard for Ozone 
 
 
These comments are submitted on behalf of the Sierra Club and its 
approximately 13,000 members in Wisconsin.  Sierra Club is concerned about air quality 
in Wisconsin, especially the nonattainment areas in the eastern and southeastern 
portions of the state.  EPA proposes to redesignate Kewaunee County, Wisconsin, as 
attaining the 8-hour ozone standard.  However, the proposal does not meet the 
standards of the Clean Air Act for the reasons set forth below.   
 
1. The Redesignation Request Violates Clean Air Act § 107(d)(3)(E): 
 
 
To approve a redesignation request the EPA must make the following findings: 
 

 
2
 The area has attained the national ambient air quality standard; 
 The area has a fully-approved state implementation plan; 
 That improvements in air quality is due to the permanent and enforceable 
reductions in emissions resulting from implementation of the applicable 
implementation plant and applicable Federal air pollutant control regulations 
and other permanent and enforceable reductions; 
 The Administrator has approved a maintenance plan meeting the requirements 
of 42 U.S.C. § 7505a; and 
 The area has met all requirements applicable to the area under 42 U.S.C. § 7410 
and Subchapter I, Part D of the Clean Air Act. 
 
42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3)(E).   
 
a) The area will not have an approved state implementation plan, pursuant to 
Clean Air Act §§ 110 and Subchapter I, part D, when the Administrator 
considers the redesignation request. 
 
1) The Act explicitly requires the SIP to mandate Reasonably 
Available Control Technology (RACT) for all VOC sources within 
the nonattainment area, including each category of VOC sources 
covered by Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. 42 
U.S.C. §7502(c)(1), 7511a(b)(2).  Wisconsin has not demonstrated 
that the SIP meets this requirement.  Examples of VOC source 
categories covered by EPA-issued CTG documents, include, but 
are not limited to: aerospace, synthetic organic compound 
manufacturing, reactor and distillations processes, shipbuilding, 
wood furniture, large petroleum dry cleaners, air oxidation 
processes in synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industries, 
equipment leaks from natural gas/gasoline processing plants, 
and a number of others.  The statute requires RACT for each 
category of VOC sources covered by CTG documents.   
 
2) Wisconsin has not revised or updated any of its existing VOC 
RACT rules since the area was designated as nonattainment.  
While some RACT rules for VOC were promulgated for the 1-
hour ozone standard, it is Sierra Club’s understanding that 
Wisconsin has not reviewed them after the 8-hour nonattainment 
designation to determine whether they are still valid and 

 
3
sufficiently stringent under the 8-hour standard.  There have been 
significant improvements in VOC controls developed over the 
past decade as demonstrated by the new controls in place in other 
nonattainment areas, such as the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District in California.  These controls include new 
measures for fuels, paints, and other consumer products. 
 
3) Wisconsin’s NOx RACT rule is not final.  While it has been 
adopted under state law, it is Sierra Club’s understanding that the 
RACT rules have not yet been approved by U.S. EPA into the 
Wisconsin SIP.  Therefore, the proposal to redesignate Kewaunee 
County does not meet 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3). 
 
4) Wisconsin does not have a fully-approved SIP in place because it 
has failed to submit a nonattainment SIP for the existing 8-hour 
ozone standard.  This plan was due on June 15, 2007.  Not only 
was it not submitted by Wisconsin before the deadline, but it is 
Sierra Club’s understanding that Wisconsin has not even 
prepared a nonattainment SIP submittal.  Unless Wisconsin has a 
fully approved nonattainment SIP in place for 8-hour ozone, the 
Administrator is prohibited from approving Wisconsin’s 
redesignation request.   
 
5) Clean Air Mercury Rule:  Wisconsin has not submitted a SIP 
program to control mercury.  Wisconsin’s SIP is required to 
include provisions to limit emissions of mercury.  This has not 
been done, which means that Wisconsin’s SIP is incomplete and 
EPA cannot redesignate any area as in attainment.     
 
6) Failure to ensure adequate funding and personnel.  42 U.S.C. § 
7410 (a)(2)(E).  The state lacks adequate funding and personnel to 
provide a user-friendly website for its permits, to respond to EPA 
comments regarding PSD permits, and maintain organized files 
accessible to the public.  These shortcomings were identified by 
EPA as part of its review of the state’s PSD program in 2006.  
Until the funding and resource issues are resolved, DNR may not 
approve the redesignation.    
 
7) Wisconsin has no contingency measures specified should 
Kewaunee County not attain the 8-hour standard in the future.  
Instead, Wisconsin proposes to “evaluate the sufficiency of 
control measures that have already been promulgated, but not 

 
4
fully implemented at the time of the violation, to return the area 
to attainment” and then, at an unspecified future time 
“determine[] that additional [unspecified] measures are necessary 
to return the area to attainment… from the list….”  See WDNR 
Response to Comments.  This is insufficient to satisfy 42 U.S.C. § 
7407(d)(3). 
 
8) Wisconsin does not have a fully approved SIP because it has not 
yet complied with the Credible Evidence Rule.  62 Fed. Reg. 8314. 
 
b) The reductions are not due to enforceable and permanent measures. 
 
 
Redesignation is only appropriate if the EPA Administrator determines that the 
improvement in air quality, between designation as nonattainment and the petition for 
redesignation as attainment, “is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in 
emission resulting…”  42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3)(E)(iii).  Wisconsin’s request for 
redesignation does not make this showing.  Instead, it shows a calculated reduction, 
which is neither real nor permanent and enforceable.   
 
Wisconsin’s redesignation request purports to show a decrease in actual 
emissions, through permanent and enforceable measures, between 2002 (a year of 
nonattainment) to 2005 (a year of purportedly “clean data”), claiming that “Wisconsin 
has documented specific permanent and enforceable programs responsible for emission 
reductions over this time period.” Wisconsin relies upon a number of claimed emission 
reductions between 2002 and 2005.  However, these claimed reductions appear to be 
either a result of a different metric to calculate emissions in 2002 versus 2005, or due to 
unenforceable and non-permanent reductions. 
1) In Appendix 4 there were different emission factors applied in 2002 and 
2005, or a different method of calculating emissions was used, with 2005 
emission factors or methods generally resulting in lower emissions than 
the factors or methods applied in 2002.  For example, the emission factors 
for fuel combustion in 2005 are much lower than the factors used to 
calculate 2002 emissions.  While emission factors may have been updated 
to be more accurate, the mere updating of emission factors fromyou’re 
year to another does not result in lower emissions.  If Wisconsin is to 
demonstrate that emissions actually decreases between 2002 and 2005, it 
must do so with an apples-to-apples comparison.  Specifically, the same 
emission factor must be applied in both reference years if Wisconsin is to 
show a “decrease.”   
2) The reduction in emissions between 2002 and 2005-- to the extent it exists 
if the same emission factor is applied in both years—is due to non-

 
5
permanent and non-enforceable variables.  For example, emissions from 
point sources and nonpoint sources in Appendix 4 are calculated based on 
variables such as vehicle miles traveled, amount of fuel combusted, and 
county employment.  These variables directly effect the emissions from 
year to year, but are neither permanent nor enforceable.  Indeed, EPA 
commented on a similar point to the Wisconsin DNR when it noted that 
local traffic congestion controls are not enforceable and cannot be relied 
upon by Wisconsin in the redesignation request.  Therefore, Wisconsin’s 
submission does not demonstrate that any such decreases are due to 
permanent and enforceable reductions. 
3) One of the most significant sources of ozone-causing pollution is fossil-
fueled electricity generation.  Wisconsin DNR calculates NOx emission 
reductions for these units from 1995 through 2005.  See Appendix 5.  
However, this determination of reduced emissions is not based on 
enforceable reductions.  Rather, it is based on a comparison of historical 
actual emissions.  For example, Wisconsin compares the actual emissions 
in 1995 to the actual emissions in 2005.  The problem with this comparison 
is that the actual emissions in 2005 are not the “enforceable” emission 
rates from the sources and do not represent a permanent and enforceable 
reduction.  The “enforceable” emission rates are those that are required by 
regulation or permit limit (i.e., the potential to emit).  Reductions due to 
unenforceable decreases in operating time and/or voluntary reductions in 
emission rates are not sufficient to satisfy 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3)(E)(iii).1  
Because the sources could have emitted significantly more in 2005, and 
could in the future, these facilities’ actual emissions cannot be used to 
show a permanent and enforceable reduction between 1995/2002 and 
2005.  The failure to rely on enforceable emission rates is unlawful and 
arbitrary.   
4) As noted above, EPA has not adopted Wisconsin’s RACT rules for electric 
generating units into the Wisconsin SIP.  Nevertheless, Wisconsin’s 
redesignation submission assumes that RACT rules for NOx are in place 
in the future as part of the demonstration that the purported historical 
improvement in ozone concentrations is due to enforceable reductions in 
emissions.  This reliance on future regulations as a basis for a historical 
improvement in air quality is unlawful and arbitrary.2  Moreover, even if 
                                                 
1 Since some voluntary reductions result in credits that can be used in future years, this could actually result in 
increased emissions in future years when those credits are used. 
2 Wisconsin DNR also points to “Measures in addition to Clean Air Act Requirements” in support of its showing 
required under 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3)(E)(iii).  Many, if not all of these measures occurred after the claimed 
attainment demonstration years.  For example, ultra-low sulfur diesel rules began having an effect, at the earliest, 
starting in October, 2006, the clean air nonroad diesel rules are being phased in currently, and the mobile source air 

 
6
future reductions in emissions could be used to make the demonstration 
in 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3)(E)(iii), Wisconsin’s reliance on RACT rules is 
nevertheless unlawful and arbitrary because the RACT rules are not final.  
See Wall v. EPA, 265 F.3d 426 (6th Cir. 2001) (remanding designation 
approval because failure to include final RACT rules).   
c) The maintenance plan is deficient. 
1) 
Failure to include all SIP measures:  Clean Air Act § 175A(d) requires 
that the maintenance plan submitted by Wisconsin “include a 
requirement that the State will implement all measures with respect to 
the control of the air pollutant concerned which were contained in the 
State implementation plan for the area before designation of the area 
as an attainment area.”  42 U.S.C. § 7505a(d).  Such “measures” include 
the New Source Review program, including the definition of a major 
source and major modification subject to the program, the requirement 
to comply with lowest achievable emission rates, the requirement to 
demonstrate that the benefits of the project outweigh the costs, and the 
requirement to off-set new and increased emissions.  These measures, 
contained in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 408, are not included in the 
maintenance plan being proposed by the Department.  As EPA has 
explained “[T]he State will be expected to maintain its implemented 
control strategy despite redesignation to attainment, unless such 
measures are shown to be unnecessary for maintenance or are replaced 
with measures that achieve equivalent reductions.”  However, upon 
redesignation, Kewaunee County sources would no longer be subject 
to Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 408—effectively removing the sources 
from the control strategy.  This is unlawful and redesignation cannot 
be approved unless and until Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 408 is 
redrafted such that it continues to apply in Kewaunee County after 
redesignation. 
2) 
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held in 
South Coast Air Quality Management District v. Environmental Protection 
Agency, 472 F.3d 882 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (hereinafter “SCAQMD”), that 
controls established in an area under the 1-hour ozone standard, 
including New Source Review requirements, must remain in place 
pursuant to the anti-backsliding provision, Clean Air Act § 172(e), 42 
U.S.C. § 7502(e).  Id. at 900-02. The court held that anything “designed 
to constrain ozone levels is a ‘control’,” pursuant to the anti-
                                                                                                                                                             
toxics rule, CAIR, and BART are not effective yet.  None of these regulations could have resulted in the reduction in 
ozone between 2002 and 2005 (to the extent there was a reduction). 

 
7
backsliding provision in § 172(e), and cannot be relaxed even when an 
area is reclassified as a lower non-attainment designation. Id. at 902. 
The existing nonattainment NSR program in effect for Kewaunee 
County Wisconsin is a “control,” which cannot be relaxed.  The 
redesignation would result in the nonattainment NSR provisions no 
longer applying to Kewaunee County sources—which is an unlawful 
relaxation of “controls” established in nonattainment areas of 
Wisconsin. This violates the anti-backsliding provision in § 172(e). EPA 
cannot approve the proposed redesitnation until Wis. Admin. Code ch. 
NR 408 is revised to ensure that it continues to apply to sources in 
Kewaunee County, which was designated as nonattainment for one 
hour ozone under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. 
3) 
Failure to conduct modeling to demonstrate maintenance:  Wisconsin’s 
plan does not demonstrate maintenance for ten years as required by 
sections 107(d)(3)(E)(iv) and 175A of the Act.   EPA rules explicitly 
require maintenance demonstrations to be supported by modeling.  40 
C.F.R. §§51.112.   See also 65 Fed. Reg. at 6711 (rejecting use of rollback 
analysis for making attainment and nonattainment predictions).  Until 
Wisconsin conducts such a modeling demonstration, it cannot approve 
the maintenance plan.   
4) 
As noted above, because of the way that Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 408 
is drafted, it would not apply to Kewaunee County after redesignation.  
Therefore, the proposal to redesignate Kewaunee County is effectively 
a proposal to remove the NSR provisions (inter alia: higher threshold 
for major sources, BACT instead of LAER, benefits outweigh costs, and 
no offsets) also violates Section 110(l), 42 U.S.C. § 7410(l).  This 
provision states that “the Administrator may not approve a revision of 
a plan if the revision would interfere with any reasonable applicable 
requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress … 
or any other applicable requirement of this chapter.”  Id. Creating large 
loopholes that increase the major source threshold, lower the control 
technology requirements, and removing the offset requirements all 
will result in increased air pollution and interfere with both attainment 
and reasonable further progress.

Dear Mr. Mcoaey: 
The EPA is proping to approve a request to redesignate the Kewaunee Colafity area to attainment of the %-hour 
ozone NAAQS, Plbam consider this Door County's comment. 
Door County does 
oppose Kewaufiee County's redtsigr.etion. Rather, this should be viewed..% a statement 
of observations as to EFA's focus. 
We'd like to call your attention ta some salient truths: 
6 
Upwind SOWCCS of ozone and irs constituents cause, or at the very least c~nrribute significantly to, 
downwind [e.g., Door County's] noncompliance with NAAQS, 
m 
rhcal and long-mge tramport of ozone and its constituents have and will continue to preclude 
downwind attainment of the NAAQS. 
e 
The overarching goal is to reduce emissions so that the NAAQS are universally met. 
e 
Reducing emissions ~~pwind 
is the only means to dacwase ozone concentrations downwind, 
Raiher than focus on redesignation, would it not make sense for the EYA to: 
r 
Find the upwind sourcas that came or contribute significantly to downwind non-co~npliance 
with ozone 
ambient air quality standards, 
s 
Regulate emissions corn [i,m., impose very stringeirt Pirnitarians an] upwitrd regions to &ddress the issue 
and allow downwind e g i ~ n s  
a fair opportunity to achi~ve som~liance. 
a 
Place a moratorium on upwind sources being deemed ta have attained NMQS, if impacted downwind 
areas continue to show monitored nonattainmeat of tlbs NAAQS. 
The foregoing appears to be a rationale approach that will ameliorate the problem.

RE:  Comments on U.S. EPA’s Proposed Redesignation of the Columbus Area to 
Attainment for Ozone, Docket ID No. EPA-R05-OAR-2009-0220 
 
Dear Mr. Mooney,  
 
 
On behalf of its more than 12,000 members in Ohio, the Natural Resources Defense 
Council (“NRDC”) hereby comments on U.S. EPA’s proposal to redesignate the Columbus area 
in Ohio as attainment for the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”), 
74 Fed. Reg. 27,973 (June 12, 2009).  Ohio EPA’s redesignation request fails to demonstrate 
compliance with the ozone NAAQS, does not ensure that compliance would be maintained in the 
future or provide for adequate contingency measures, and is improper due to the vacatur of the 
Subpart I non-attainment area classification.  As such, U.S. EPA cannot redesignate the 
Columbus area on this record.  
 
I. 
Legal Standards 
 
In order for an area to be redesignated from non-attainment to attainment, the U.S. EPA 
must find that five requirements are have been satisfied: 
 
1. the area has attained the NAAQS; 
 
2. the applicable implementation plan for the area has been fully approved under 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(k); 
 
3. the improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in 
emissions resulting from implementation of the applicable implementation plan,

federal air pollution control regulations, and other permanent and enforceable 
reductions; 
 
4. a maintenance plan for the area is fully approved as meeting the requirements of 
42 U.S.C. § 7505a; and  
 
5. the state has met all requirements applicable to the area under 42 U.S.C. § 7410 
and part D of subchapter I of the Clean Air Act.  
 
42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3)(E); Wall v. U.S. EPA, 265 F.3d 426, 430 (6th Cir. 2001).  At least the 
first, fourth, and fifth requirements have not been satisfied here.  
 
  
II. 
The Columbus Area Has Not Achieved the Ozone NAAQS 
 
In order for a non-attainment area to be re-designated as in attainment, the area must 
actually achieve compliance with the NAAQS for the pollutant in question.  The 1997 ozone 
NAAQS of which Ohio EPA is seeking to demonstrate attainment is 0.08ppm.  40 C.F.R. 
§ 50.10.  The Columbus area has not attained that standard because, as Ohio EPA’s own 
application shows, the Franklin County-New Albany monitor has a fourth highest three year 
average of 0.084ppm, which is higher than the 0.08ppm standard.  (Ohio EPA Request at 9).  
U.S. EPA contends that the relevant standard is complied with because the area has achieved 
average 8-hour ozone concentrations less than .085ppm. 74 Fed. Reg. at 27,976.  While 40 
C.F.R. pt. 50, app. I, purports to authorize such a rounding convention, its use here improperly 
inflates the 1997 standard from its actual value of .08ppm and would allow an area to be 
considered to be in attainment even though it has fourth highest three year average 
concentrations that exceed the actual ozone NAAQS.  Such rounding approach has been rejected 
by U.S. EPA’s own scientific advisory committee in developing the 2008 ozone NAAQS as 
permitting ozone concentrations that exceed the NAAQS to the detriment of the public health.  It 
would be arbitrary and capricious for U.S. EPA to use it here to find an area to be in attainment 
when, in reality, it is not.  
 
Redesignation is also foreclosed because the evidence is clear that the Columbus area is 
out of attainment of the 2008 ozone standard, which is currently set at 0.075ppm.1  40 C.F.R. 
                                                 
1 The adequacy of the 2008 ozone NAAQS has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, 
State of Mississippi v. U.S. EPA, Case No. 08-1200 and consolidated cases (Ozone NAAQS Litigation), because, as 
U.S. EPA’s own scientific advisory committee (“CASAC”) unanimously concluded, the “overwhelming scientific 
evidence” supports substantially reducing the ozone standard to .060 - .070 ppm. 73 Fed. Reg. 16,436-01, 16,449.  
Such a lower ozone NAAQS has been found necessary not only by CASAC, but also by U.S. EPA staff scientists, 
state governments, national health and environmental organizations, the WHO, and numerous medical societies 
including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the International Society for 
Environmental Epidemiology and the American Thoracic Society.  See Comments submitted by Caroline Baier-
Anderson et al., American Lung Association, Environmental Defense, & Sierra Club, Document ID EPA-HQ-OAR-
2005-0172-4261.1.  A standard of .060 ppm would more effectively “protect the public health with an adequate 
margin of safety,” as required by 42 U.S.C. § 7409(b)(1).   
U.S. EPA has recently filed an unopposed motion to hold the State of Mississippi case in abeyance so that 
the agency can determine whether it thinks the 0.075ppm ozone standard should be revised.  The inadequacy of the 
2008 standard and the likelihood that it will be changed further demonstrates that, even if the Columbus area had 
 
2

§ 50.15.  Ohio EPA has recommended that the Columbus area be designated non-attainment 
under the new 2008 ozone standard.  (Letter from Chris Korleski to Lynn Buhl, Mar. 9, 2009, 
at 2).  In addition, the 2006 to 2008 monitoring data provided by Ohio EPA demonstrates that 
five out of the eight monitors in the area have fourth highest three year averages that exceed the 
0.075ppm standard.  As such, the Columbus area has not demonstrated compliance with the 
currently applicable NAAQS and, therefore, cannot be considered in attainment with Clean Air 
Act ozone standards.   Redesignation to attainment under the 1997 standard would suspend RFP 
requirements and other measures that would enable the Columbus area to make progress toward 
attainment of the 2008 standard.  As a result, redesignation to attainment now would be 
counterproductive and contrary to the aims of the Clean Air Act. 
 
The ruling in Wall v. EPA, 265 F.3d 426 (6th Cir. 2001), does not compel a different 
conclusion.  In that case, redesignation for the Cincinnati area was challenged because, inter alia, 
another rulemaking proceeding had found that the area was certain or highly likely to require 
additional emission reductions.  Id. at 437. The court rejected the challenge because the other 
proceeding was not an attainment rulemaking and its data were outdated.  Id.  In this case, 
however, Ohio has made a non-attainment recommendation under the 2008 standard using data 
that are not out of date, and thus redesignation to attainment here would not be reasonable. As 
the Wall court stated, “[A]ny final determination regarding the adequacy of a maintenance plan 
[i.e. redesignation to attainment] will be made ‘in light of the particular circumstances facing the 
area proposed for redesignation and based on all relevant information available at the time.’” Id. 
at 431 (quoting Calcagni Memorandum at 8) (emphasis added). A pending designation of non-
attainment is certainly relevant information that forecloses redesignation to attainment at this 
time. 
 
 
III. 
Ohio EPA Has Not Provided an Adequate Maintenance Plan 
 
In order for the U.S. EPA to approve redesignation for the Columbus area, the agency 
must find that the Ohio EPA has presented a maintenance plan, including contingency measures, 
that will ensure that the area will remain in compliance with the ozone NAAQS for at least the 
next 10 years.  42 U.S.C. § 7505a.  While Ohio EPA purports to have submitted such a plan, it 
falls short in at least two areas.  
 
First, Ohio EPA has not provided any information showing that it has adequate resources 
to enforce the steps relied on in the maintenance plan.  Such information is required by 42 U.S.C. 
§ 7410(a)(2)(C), which requires that each plan “include a program to provide for the 
enforcement of the measures” described in the plan,” and 40 C.F.R. § 51.280, which requires a 
“description of the resources available to the State and local agencies . . . and any additional 
resources needed to carry out the plan” for the next five years.  Ohio EPA, however, has simply 
asserted that it “has the legal authority and necessary resources to actively enforce any violations 
of its rules or permit provisions.”  (Ohio EPA Request at 29).  The agency has not identified 
what those resources are, or explained how they are purportedly adequate to ensure enforcement 
                                                                                                                                                             
achieved compliance with the 1997 ozone standard the area should not be found in attainment for ozone because it is 
clear that the area exceeds both the existing 2008 ozone NAAQS and the more stringent limit that should be 
established.   
 
3

of the plan.  This shortcoming is especially troublesome given that Ohio faces a $3.2 billion 
budget deficit and will likely be cutting agency budgets to try to close that gap.   
 
Second, Ohio EPA has failed to fully satisfy the requirement that it include contingency 
measures for ensuring continued attainment that can take effect “without further action by the 
State or EPA.”  42 U.S.C. § 7402(c)(9).  The U.S. EPA interprets that provision as requiring that 
the State or U.S. EPA need not take any “further rulemaking activities” in order for the 
contingency measure to be carried out.  U.S. EPA, State Implementation Plans; General 
Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 57 Fed. 
Reg. 13,498, 13,512 (Apr. 16, 1992); Greenbaum v. U.S. EPA, 370 F.3d 527, 541 (6th Cir. 
2004).   While Ohio EPA has identified a series of possible contingency measures and triggers 
for possible implementation of those measures, the agency also notes that “adoption of any 
additional control measures is subject to the necessary administrative and legal process . . . 
required by Ohio law for rulemaking.”  (Ohio EPA Request at 31).  U.S. EPA must ensure that 
Ohio EPA can adopt such additional control measures without the need for additional 
rulemaking before any redesignation for the Columbus area can be made.  
 
IV. 
The Record Does Not Demonstrate Compliance With the Subpart 2 Provisions 
Applicable to Ozone Non-Attainment Areas. 
 
In order for a non-attainment area to be redesignated, the state must have adopted in its 
State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) all applicable requirements of part D of subchapter I of the 
Clean Air Act.  42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3)(E)(v).  For areas that are out of attainment with the ozone 
NAAQS, applicable requirements include those found in 42 U.S.C. § 7511a, which requires a 
detailed reasonable further progress requirement, installation of reasonably available control 
technologies (“RACT”), implementation of gasoline vapor recovery and motor vehicle 
inspection and maintenance programs, and an emission offset requirement.  Such requirements 
must be applied to volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) where, as 
here, there is no NOx disbenefit.  42 U.S.C. § 7511a(b), (f).  There has been no demonstration 
here, however, that Ohio’s SIP includes such requirements for the Columbus area. 
 
U.S. EPA proposes that it can approve Ohio EPA’s request to redesignate the Columbus 
area because that area is classified as a Subpart 1 non-attainment area, to which only the less 
stringent requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 7502 apply, rather than a Subpart 2 area to which 42 
U.S.C. § 7511a(b),(f) applies.  74 Fed. Reg. at 27,975.  This argument fails, however, because 
the Subpart 1 classification has been vacated by the D.C. Circuit.  South Coast Air Quality Mgmt. 
Dist. v. EPA, 472 F.3d 882 (D.C. Cir. 2006), reh’g denied, 489 F.3d 1245 (2007) (clarifying the 
earlier holding).  In the wake of the SCAQMD vacatur, U.S. EPA is proposing to redesignate 
Subpart 1 non-attainment areas as moderate Subpart 2 non-attainment areas, but this proposed 
rule has not been finalized. 74 Fed. Reg. 2936.  Because the current classification has been 
vacated, however, U.S. EPA cannot make use of that classification’s requirements to avoid the 
stringent VOC and NOx controls that are required before the Columbus area can be redesignated 
to attainment. 
 
U.S. EPA contends that it can redesignate Columbus to attainment under Subpart 1 now, 
and then classify the area later as moderate non-attainment under Subpart 2 when the proposed 
 
4

rule is finalized.  74 Fed. Reg. at 27975.  The agency attempts to justify this proposal by saying 
that its policy is to evaluate requests for redesignation according to requirements in place at the 
time the request is submitted, rather than to retroactively impose requirements on an area.  Id.  
U.S. EPA’s argument, however, ignores the fact that judicial decisions “must be given full 
retroactive effect.”  Harper v. Va. Dep’t of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86, 97 (1993); see also Hatchett v. 
United States, 330 F.3d 875, 882-83 (6th Cir. 2003); Crawford v. Falcon Drilling Co., 131 F.3d 
1120, 1124 & n.4 (5th Cir. 1997) (listing cases applying Harper to non-Supreme Court 
decisions).  The SCAQMD court’s decision to “vacate” the unlawful Subpart 1 classifications 
demonstrates that the decision to exempt such non-attainment areas from Subpart 2 requirements 
was never valid or effective and “restores the status quo before the invalid rule took effect. . . .”  
Envtl. Def. v. Leavitt, 329 F. Supp. 2d 55, 64 (D.D.C. 2004) (citing Indep. U.S. Tanker Owners 
Comm. v. Dole, 809 F.2d 847, 854 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).  As such, U.S. EPA can allow 
redesignation of the Columbus area only under the applicable Subpart 2 requirements, not the 
less stringent and vacated Subpart I classification.    
 
 
V. 
Conclusion 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the U.S. EPA must reject Ohio EPA’s proposal to redesignate 
the Columbus area as attainment for ozone.

Dear Mr. Barrett:
The Association
of Electric Companies of Texas
(AECT)
is a trade
association
representing electric companies in Texas.
Our members serve over half of the customers in the
state and generate a majority of the electricity generated in Texas. This letter is in behalf of the
following members of AECT: AEP Swepco; AEP Texas; CenerPoint Energy; EI Paso Electric;
Entergy; Luminant; NRG Texas; Oncer; PNM Resources; Reliant Energy; TXU Energy and Xcel.
On October 19, 2010, EPA Region 6 proposed to partially approve and partially
disapprove a Texas State Implementation Plan (""SIP"") revision that implements a mandate from the
Texas Legislature that has already achieved reductions in NOx and S02 in Texas. 75 Fed. Reg.
24235 (Oct. 19, 2010). EPA proposes to partially disapprove one integral portion of the proposed
revision, despite expressly stating that the portion at issue does not interfere with attainment or
maintenance of the relevant NMOS, nor cause or contribute to any increase in PSD increments. Id
at 64,238 and 64,240.
AECT requests an extension of the comment period for EPA's proposal by at least 30
days to allow AECT companies to thoroughly review the proposal and to provide meaningful
comments to the agency. This SIP revision was submitted to EPA over ten years ago. EPA's
October 2010 proposal is the first mention of the agency's intention to disapprove any of the
proposed SIP revision. In light of the length of time it took EPA to review the pending revision and
because of the importance of this rule as applied to AECT companies and other sources in Texas,
AECT believes that a 30-day extension is more than reasonable. Allowing this limited additional
time will not prejudice any party interested in the proposal, nor should it unreasonably delay EPA's
issuance of its final decision, and it should improve the decision-making process by allowing for
more thoughtful participation in this process by interested persons.
Please notify me directly of your decision on this request and do not hesitate to contact
me if you have any questions.
Very truly yours,
John W. Fainter

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
On October 19, 2010, EPA proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove 
revisions to Texas’s State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) submitted by the Texas Commission on 
Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) on January 3, 2000, and July 31, 2002.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 
64,235 (Oct. 19, 2010).  Below is a summary of Luminant’s comments on EPA’s proposed 
partial approval and partial disapproval. 
 
• 
EPA’s proposed disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) is not supported 
and is an arbitrary change in EPA’s position on Pollution Control Project (“PCP”) 
Standard Permits (“SP”) in Texas. 
 
• 
EPA’s disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) is contrary to Clean Air Act 
(“CAA”) § 110(l)’s requirement that EPA approve a SIP revision unless it makes a 
determination that “the revision would interfere with any applicable requirement 
concerning attainment and reasonable further progress” in light of EPA’s 
acknowledgement that collateral CO emissions from PCP SPs does not threaten 
attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”). 
 
• 
EPA’s reliance on New York v. EPA to support its disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code 
§ 116.911(a)(2) is not appropriate because the Texas PCP SP is not an exemption, is 
subject to notice and comment, and subjects the recipient to a CO limit. 
 
• 
EPA should follow its established position that PCP SPs are acceptable under the CAA. 
 
• 
EPA incorrectly concludes that its prior disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617 
necessitates disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2).  Rather, EPA must 
independently justify its disapproval of these provisions relating to the Texas Senate Bill 
No. 7 (“SB7”) permitting program. 
 
• 
EPA’s disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) would affect only sources 
that have already obtained PCP SPs under SB7 and therefore would have only a 
retroactive effect, which EPA described as an “inequitable” result in New York v. EPA. 
  
• 
The plants identified by EPA in its Technical Support Document are not in retroactive 
violation of New York v. EPA.  The D.C. Circuit’s decision did not address any 
retroactive application, a person cannot “violate” a court decision like New York I, and 
EPA has not demonstrated that Luminant’s plants would have exceeded major 
modification thresholds.

Luminant1 submits these comments on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 
(“EPA”) proposed rule to partially approve and partially disapprove revisions of the Texas State 
Implementation Plan (“SIP”) submitted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 
(“TCEQ”) related to application and permitting procedures for grandfathered and electing 
electric generating facilities (“EGFs”).  75 Fed. Reg. 64,235 (Oct. 19, 2010) (“proposed 
approval” or “proposed disapproval”).  Luminant is specifically concerned with EPA’s proposed 
disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2), which requires EGFs proposing to use new 
control methods to comply with certain requirements of the Texas Standard Permit (“SP”) for 
Pollution Control Projects (“PCP”) in order to be granted an electric generating facility permit 
under Texas Senate Bill No. 7 (“SB7” or “Senate Bill 7”).  See id. at 64,237 (citing 30 Tex. 
Admin. Code §  116.617).  Luminant’s specific comments are provided below.2 
I. 
Background 
A. 
Grandfathered Facilities and Texas Senate Bill 7 
In 1971, the State of Texas began permitting new and modified sources of air emissions 
under Texas’s New Source Review (“NSR”) state implementation program.  Texas’s first major 
                                                 
1 As used herein, “Luminant” refers collectively to Luminant Generation Company LLC 
and Big Brown Power Company LLC. 
  
2 Further, Luminant is a member of and adopts and supports the comments filed by The 
Association of Electric Companies of Texas and the Gulf Coast Lignite Coalition.

clean air law grandfathered existing plants and plants under construction from the requirement to 
obtain NSR air permits.  In 1999, the Texas State Legislature passed SB7, which amended the 
Texas Utilities Code (“TUC”) and, among other things, required the TCEQ to establish a 
program to implement the requirements of TUC § 39.264.  That provision required EGFs that 
existed on January 1, 1999 (and were previously grandfathered) to apply for a new permit 
(referred to herein as an “SB7 permit”) covering emissions of NOx and SO2.  EGFs that were not 
grandfathered could elect to obtain an SB7 permit to participate in the emissions banking and 
allowance trading program established by SB7.  Applications for SB7 permits were due by 
September 1, 2000. 
To implement the requirements of TUC § 39.264, TCEQ adopted rules in January 2000.  
These rules consisted of (1) a new 30 Tex. Admin. Code Chapter 101, Subchapter H, Division 2 
implementing the mass cap and trade requirements of SB7, and (2) a new 30 Tex. Admin. Code 
Chapter 116, Subchapter I implementing the SB7 permitting program.  TCEQ’s revisions to 30 
Tex. Admin. Code Chapter 116 established “an allowance and permitting program for regulating 
grandfathered EGFs.”  75 Fed. Reg. at 64,237.  Chapter 116, Subchapter I set out the 
requirements for EGFs to apply for SB7 permits.  One portion of that subchapter, 
§ 116.911(a)(2), requires an SB7 permit applicant to comply with certain requirements of 
Texas’s SP for PCPs in 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617.  TCEQ submitted these rules to EPA as 
revisions to the SIP on January 3, 2000.  In June 2002, TCEQ adopted amendments to its 30 Tex. 
Admin. Code Chapter 116 air permitting rules, including Subchapter I.  TCEQ submitted these 
rules to EPA as revisions to the SIP on July 31, 2002.

B. 
Texas’s Standard Permit Program and Standard Permit for Pollution 
Control Projects 
 
Texas’s SP for PCPs (30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617) was originally submitted by 
TCEQ for approval by EPA on December 9, 2002, with its general regulations for SPs.  See 68 
Fed. Reg. 64,543, 64,547 (Nov. 14, 2003).  The general SP regulations were approved by EPA in 
2003 as meeting the Minor NSR SIP requirements; however, at that time, EPA did not approve 
Texas’s proposed SP for PCP, 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617.  Id.    TCEQ submitted a new 
revision to its PCP SP on February 1, 2006, to limit the PCP SP for purposes of Minor NSR.  
EPA published a final rule disapproving this version of the PCP SP on September 15, 2010.  75 
Fed. Reg. 56,424 (Sept. 15, 2010).  EPA concluded that the PCP SP did “not meet the 
requirements of the Texas Minor NSR Standard Permits Program,” because “[i]t does not apply 
to similar sources,” and therefore “lacks the requisite replicable standardized permit terms 
specifying how the Director’s discretion is to be implemented for the case-by-case 
determinations.”  Id. at 56,447.3   
C. 
EPA’s Proposed Action on Texas’s SIP Revisions Related to Application 
Procedures for Grandfathered and Electing EGFs 
 
On October 19, 2010, EPA proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove 
revisions to portions of Texas’s SIP implementing SB7 and the EGF permitting program.  75 
Fed. Reg. 64,235 (Oct. 19, 2010).  EPA proposed to approve all of TCEQ’s January 3, 2000 
submittal except for 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2).  As grounds for its proposed 
                                                 
3 Several parties, including Luminant, have filed petitions for review with the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court seeking to set aside EPA’s September 15, 2010 Final Rule 
disapproving revisions to portions of Texas’s SIP, including the PCP SP.  See Petition for 
Review, Texas v. U.S. Envtl. Protection Agency, No. 10-60891 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2010); Petition 
for Review, Luminant Generation Co. v. U.S. Envtl. Protection Agency, No. 10-60891 (5th Cir. 
Nov. 12, 2010); Petition for Review, Tex. Ass’n of Bus., Tex. Ass’n of Mfrs., Tex. Oil and Gas 
Ass’n, Chamber of Commerce of U.S. of Am. v. U.S. Envtl. Protection Agency, No. 10-60891 
(5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2010).

disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2), EPA cites only its recent disapproval of 30 
Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617 and the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit 
in New York v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“New York I”).  EPA also declined to take 
action on TCEQ’s revisions to Chapter 101, Subchapter H, relating to the Emissions Banking 
and Trading Allowance (“EBTA”) program, stating that it would consider those provisions in a 
separate rulemaking.  On November 16, 2010, EPA took direct final action to approve the EBTA 
program, explaining that EPA has determined that these changes to the SIP comply with the 
Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and EPA regulations and are consistent with EPA policies.  Furthermore, 
EPA determined that the EBTA will improve air quality.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 69,884 (Nov. 16, 
2010). 
II. 
Luminant’s Interest in EPA’s Proposed Disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 
116.911(a)(2) 
 
Luminant is the largest competitive power generation company in Texas.  It operates 
lignite mines and generates electricity with 12 solid fuel-fired units, 35 natural gas-fired units, 
and 2 nuclear units.  Luminant has units that were grandfathered from Texas’s NSR SIP program 
in 1971 and that obtained SB7 permits and were required by 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 
116.911(a)(2) to comply with the requirements in 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617.  Luminant 
also has units that elected to obtain SB7 permits in order to participate in the EBTA program 
under SB7 and also complied with 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617.  These include units for 
which low NOx burners were proposed as new control methods to meet the new emission limits 
set forth in the SB7.  Such units were required by 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) to meet 
the requirements in 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617 for collateral CO increases resulting from 
the operation of low NOx burners.  In the proposed rule, EPA identifies by name two facilities 
where collateral CO emissions increases, occurring only as a result of installing new NOx 

 
 
7 
 
controls, were alleged to be above the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) 
significance levels.  See Technical Support Document C at 2.  The facilities identified were 
Luminant’s4 Big Brown Steam Electric Station (for low NOx burners and over-fired air on Units 
1 and 2) and Stryker Creek Steam Electric Station (for low NOx burners and separated over-fired 
air on Unit 2).  Thus, Luminant has a direct interest in this rulemaking.  Although EPA 
acknowledges that Luminant obtained these permits prior to the D.C. Circuit’s decision in New 
York I, EPA contends that Luminant is nevertheless “in violation retroactively of the court 
decision.”  Id.  Luminant strongly disagrees with EPA’s assessment of these two facilities and 
their compliance status and also disagrees with EPA’s proposal to disapprove 30 Tex. Admin. 
Code § 116.911(a)(2).   
III. 
Luminant’s Comments on EPA’s Partial Approval and Partial Disapproval of 
Texas’s SIP Revisions Related to Application and Permitting Procedures for 
Grandfathered and Electing EGFs 
 
Luminant’s comments on EPA’s October 19, 2010 proposal relate primarily to EPA’s 
proposal to disapprove 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2)—the section that requires 
grandfathered and electing EGFs to comply with certain requirements of 30 Tex. Admin. Code 
§ 116.617.  EPA’s proposed disapproval is not supported by the CAA or by caselaw.  Moreover, 
the effect of EPA’s disapproval would be to unfairly and arbitrarily apply permitting 
requirements retroactively to sources that appropriately met SB7 requirements and installed new 
pollution control equipment to reduce emissions.  EPA agrees that there would be no benefit to 
air quality in Texas resulting from its disapproval of this section.  See 75 Fed. Reg. at 64,238 
(“EPA believes that all of the resultant collateral CO increases across the State of Texas 
                                                 
4 The permits originally issued to Texas Electric Company and TXU Generation 
Company were transferred to Luminant Generation Company LLC.  Big Brown Power Company 
LLC is the owner of Big Brown Steam Electric Station and Luminant Generation Company LLC 
is the owner of Stryker Creek Steam Electric Station. 

 
 
8 
 
(including those from the two plants) do not interfere with attainment or maintenance of the 
NAAQS for CO, et al., nor cause or contribute to increase in PSD increments, much less a 
violation of any NAAQS.”).  In fact, as noted above, EPA has determined that the EBTA 
associated with SB7 permitting will improve air quality.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 69,884 (Nov. 16, 
2010). 
A. 
EPA’s Proposed Disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) 
In response to SB7, TCEQ adopted Chapter 116, Subchapter I, which implements the 
applicability and permitting requirements for grandfathered and electing EGFs, and submitted 
these SIP revisions to EPA on January 3, 2000.5  Subchapter I requires the owner or operator of a 
grandfathered EGF to apply for a permit to operate—the SB7 permit.  See 30 Tex. Admin. Code 
§ 116.910.  Section 116.911 requires owners or operators of grandfathered or electing coal-fired 
EGFs to “submit an application to authorize [NOx] emissions and, if applicable, [SO2] and [PM] 
emissions.”  30 Tex. Admin Code § 116.911(a).  In order for an owner or operator to have 
received an SB7 permit, it had to submit information to TCEQ to demonstrate that all of the 
following were satisfied: 
1) 
propose monitoring and reporting for the measurement of emissions and 
demonstration of performance consistent with § 116.914; 
 
2) 
if the applicant proposes the use of new control methods these must comply with 
the requirements in § 116.617(1), (3), (4)(A), and (B) and (5)—(9) (relating to 
Standard Permit for Pollution Control Projects); 
 
3) 
when required, provide computerized air dispersion modeling and/or ambient 
monitoring where there is an increase in emissions to determine the air quality 
impacts from controls proposed in section (2); and 
 
4) 
for coal-fired grandfathered and electing EGFs, demonstrate that it meets the 
opacity limitations of §111.111. 
 
                                                 
5 These revisions were adopted by TCEQ on December 16, 1999. 

 
 
9 
 
See 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(1)—(4).  An application for an SB7 permit must have 
been submitted by September 1, 2000.  See id. § 116.911(c).  Thus, as EPA recognized in its 
Technical Support Document, “[t]his subsection regards only initial applications.”  Technical 
Support Document A at 9 (emphasis added).  
 
EPA has proposed to disapprove 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) because of its 
requirement for SB7 permit applicants to comply with the requirements in 30 Tex. Admin. Code 
§ 116.617(1), (3), (4)(A), and (B) and (5) - (9) relating to the SP for PCPs.  75 Fed. Reg. at 
64,237.  EPA’s proposed disapproval in this instance is based on its disapproval of the Texas 
PCP SP program on September 15, 2010, and on the D.C. Circuit’s decision in New York I 
vacating EPA’s PCP exclusion for Major NSR requirements.  Id. at 64,238.  However, 
disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) at this time would have only the effect of 
retroactively removing a permitting procedure and authorization relied upon by sources when 
they applied for SB7 permits over ten years ago and reduced emissions.  This would unjustly call 
into question these properly obtained emission reduction permits and has no prospective 
application.  EPA’s proposal to disapprove 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) is not required 
by the decision in New York I and is not supported by CAA § 110(l); therefore, EPA should 
instead approve 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) along with the other revisions it has 
proposed to approve. 
1. 
EPA’s proposal to disapprove 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) is 
contrary to Clean Air Act Section 110(l). 
 
Under CAA § 110(l), EPA may disapprove a SIP revision only if it determines the 
revision would “interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable 
further progress . . . or any other applicable requirement.”  42 U.S.C. § 7410(l).  The courts, 
including the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, have 

 
 
10 
 
further elaborated on the standards for EPA review of proposed SIP revisions.  As the Fifth 
Circuit explained: 
[The CAA] requires the Agency to “approve any revision of an implementation 
plan” if it “determines that it meets the requirements” of § 110(a)(2).  On its face, 
this provision applies to any revision, without regard either to its breadth of 
applicability, or to whether it is to be effective before or after the attainment date; 
rather, Agency approval is subject only to the condition that the revised plan 
satisfy the general requirements applicable to original implementation plans.  Far 
from evincing congressional intent that the Agency assume control of a State’s 
emission limitations mix once its initial plan is approved, the revision section is to 
all appearances the mechanism by which the States may obtain approval of their 
developing policy choices as to the most practicable and desirable methods of 
restricting total emissions to a level which is consistent with the national ambient 
air standards. 
 
Fla. Power & Light Co. v. Costle, 650 F.2d 579, 587 (5th Cir. Unit B June 1981) (quoting Train 
v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 421 U.S. 60, 80 (1975)) (alteration and emphasis in original).  
As the court further explained:  “Under the [CAA], therefore, states may provide for 
‘ameliorative revisions’ of an established pollution control scheme as long as national clean air 
standards are not compromised.”  Id. (citing Train, 421 U.S. at 98). 
Texas’s choice to achieve emissions reductions through SB7 permits and to require 
permit applicants to comply with requirements in 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617 when 
proposing to install pollution control equipment more than satisfies the court’s test for mandatory 
approval.   For one thing, 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) is part of a larger permitting 
scheme to reduce emissions of SO2, and NOx.  That Texas initiative has been extremely 
successful.  With respect to NOx emissions from electric generating facilities, Texas now ranks 
among the cleanest in nation.  The NOx emission rate from Texas electric generating facilities is 
now 11th cleanest in the U.S., which is the result of a 64% reduction in NOx tons per year 
emissions from 1997 through 2009.  See EPA Acid Rain Database 2010.  Moreover, any 
collateral increases in other pollutants resulting from the installation of pollution control 

 
 
11 
 
equipment (such as increases in CO after the installation of low NOx burners) are demonstrably 
and admittedly not interfering with attainment of air quality standards.  In fact, EPA itself has 
affirmatively found that 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) is protective of NAAQS and that 
such standards have not been compromised in the ten years that the provision has been 
implemented in Texas.  75 Fed. Reg. at 64,238.  As EPA stated, it “believes that all of the 
resultant collateral CO increases across the State of Texas (including those from the two plants 
[that obtained a PCP SP rather than a Major NSR permit]) do not interfere with attainment or 
maintenance of the NAAQS for CO, et al., nor cause or contribute to increase in PSD 
increments, much less a violation of any NAAQS.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Moreover, as EPA 
recognizes, Texas has revised its PCP SP program so that it prospectively only applies to Minor 
NSR and therefore could not be construed to run afoul of federal statutory NSR requirements.  
75 Fed. Reg. at 56,444.  EPA’s proposal to disapprove 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) is 
therefore contrary to the CAA, and any action to disapprove that section would step outside the 
“narrow role to be played by EPA” in the SIP revision process.  Fla. Power & Light Co., 650 
F.2d at 587.  
2. 
EPA over-reads the D.C. Circuit’s opinion in New York I to require 
disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2). 
 
EPA is improperly relying on the D.C. Circuit’s decision in New York I to support its 
disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2).  75 Fed. Reg. at 64,238 (citing New York 
v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3 (D.C. Cir. 2005)).  That case has nothing to do with PCP permits and 
requirements to meet emission limits like those contained in Texas’s SB7 permits.  In New 
York I, the D.C. Circuit was considering EPA’s definition of “modification” in its NSR 
regulations, specifically, a 2002 rule that entirely exempted “environmentally beneficial” PCPs 
from NSR “by excluding them from the definition of ‘modification.’”  New York I, 413 F.3d at 

 
 
12 
 
40.  The Court held that “EPA lacks authority to create PCP exemptions from NSR.” Id. at 41 
(emphasis added).   
The D.C. Circuit’s decision on EPA’s 2002 rule does not apply to the requirement in 30 
Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) nor to Texas’s PCP SPs in general.  Unlike the federal PCP 
exclusion that was vacated by the D.C. Circuit, the Texas PCP SP is not an exclusion—it is a 
permitting requirement, subject to notice and comment, that imposes emissions limitations.  This 
type of permit program was not considered, much less invalidated, by the D.C. Circuit.  Despite 
this fundamental difference, in light of New York I, Texas submitted a revised version of 30 Tex. 
Admin. Code § 116.617 on February 1, 2006, for EPA approval to prospectively limit the use of 
the State’s PCP SP to Minor NSR.  See 75 Fed. Reg. at 56,444.  Thus, for at least two reasons, 
the D.C. Circuit’s decision in New York I relating to PCP exclusions for Major NSR is irrelevant 
to a decision on a PCP standard permit for Minor NSR. 
 
Accordingly, even after New York I, EPA has not interpreted or applied the decision to its 
actions or permits under the Texas SIP.  For example, EPA has repeatedly reviewed PCP 
emission limits established pursuant to 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) as part of its Title 
V permit review process in Texas and, even after the New York I decision, has never, to 
Luminant’s knowledge, concluded that such limits were not proper or were illegal.  EPA’s 
decision to suddenly apply New York I retroactively to the Texas SIP is contrary to the agency’s 
established practice post-New York I. 
3. 
EPA’s disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617 does not justify or 
require disapproval of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2). 
 
The only reason other than the New York I decision that EPA gives for its proposal to 
disapprove 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) is that EPA has recently disapproved 30 Tex. 
Admin. Code § 116.617.  Luminant believes EPA’s action in disapproving 30 Tex. Admin. 

 
 
13 
 
Code § 116.617 was contrary to law in its own right and has filed a petition for review with the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit seeking to set aside that action.  That final rule suffers 
from many of the same flaws as EPA’s proposal here—there is simply nothing about Texas’s 
PCP SP or the requirements in the SP that interferes with attainment of air quality standards or 
runs afoul of the NSR provisions of the Act.  Moreover, 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) 
does not simply incorporate by reference 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.617, as EPA suggests.  
Instead, the SB7 permit rules, which EPA is otherwise proposing to approve, require a permit 
applicant “to comply with the requirements” of those certain cited provisions of 30 Tex. Admin. 
Code § 116.617.  30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2).  The obligation thus originates from the 
SB7 permit rules, and EPA has an independent obligation to justify its disapproval of the 
substance of those requirements in this rulemaking and not simply rely on a prior one that did not 
involve the SB7 permit program. 
4. 
EPA is wrong that Luminant’s units are “in violation retroactively of the 
court decision” in New York I. 
 
 
In its Technical Support Document, EPA baldly asserts that Luminant’s units that 
“obtained their PCP SP before the court decision [in New York I] was issued” “are in violation 
retroactively of the court decision.”  Technical Support Document C at 2.  EPA is flat wrong 
about this, and there is no support in the law or the facts for such a statement. 
 
First, the D.C. Circuit expressly stated that its decision did not decide the retroactive 
effect of its decision.  In denying EPA’s request for clarification as to any retroactive effect of 
the ruling on the PCP provision, the D.C. Circuit explained that “no specific retroactive 
application of the provision is before the court.”  See Order on Rehearing, New York v. EPA, No. 
02-1387 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 9, 2005).  Instead of respecting the court’s ruling in this regard, EPA 
takes it upon it itself to presume that the decision has some retroactive application.  The court did 

 
 
14 
 
not say that.  EPA’s decision to disapprove 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) and to attempt 
to do so retroactively to state permits that have already been issued is directly contrary to the 
D.C. Circuit’s ruling on rehearing and is not supportable.   
EPA’s action is also contrary to its own position with respect to retroactive application of 
the ruling.  EPA itself recognized the inequity in applying the court’s decision retroactively:  “It 
would be inequitable to penalize sources that voluntarily installed environmentally beneficial 
pollution control equipment based on their good-faith reliance on EPA’s regulations and 
guidance.”  EPA’s Petition for Rehearing or Petition for Rehearing En Banc and Request for 
Clarification at 14, New York v. EPA, No. 02-1387 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 8, 2005).  EPA’s Request for 
Clarification of the court’s decision sought to “ensure that all sources that [had] relied on the 
PCP exclusion are treated equally.”  Id. at n.5.  Further, EPA urged that “the vacatur should not 
be applied to permitting decisions that are no longer subject to review.”  Id. (citing Reynoldsville 
Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514 U.S. 749, 758 (1995)).  Nothing in the D.C. Circuit’s decision prevents 
EPA from carrying out this previously-adopted policy on how to apply the decision, and, in fact, 
the court’s Order on Rehearing leaves that avenue plainly open to the agency. 
Second, a person cannot “violate” a court decision like New York I.  The court decision 
interprets and applies statutory law—it does not create new legal requirements that could be 
“violated.”   
Third, the allegation that Luminant’s two units should have obtained a Major NSR permit 
for increases in CO emissions following the installation of pollution control equipment is not 
supported by the facts in the record.  EPA has not addressed whether or not Luminant could have 
claimed some other exclusion, i.e., routine maintenance, repair, or replacement, or whether 
Luminant could have utilized the netting provisions if needed.  EPA has not offered sufficient 

 
 
15 
 
data in the record to support its suggestion that Luminant’s plants violated Major NSR 
requirements when installing pollution control equipment. 
B. 
EPA’s Proposed Approval of Texas’s January 2000 and July 2003 SIP 
Revisions 
 
Luminant supports EPA’s proposed approval of the balance of TCEQ’s January 3, 2000 
and July 31, 2002 submittals.  Additionally, Luminant supports EPA’s November 16, 2010 direct 
final rule to approve the EBTA program.  
IV. 
Conclusion 
EPA’s proposal should be revised to approve all of the revisions to the Texas SIP 
submitted to EPA on January 3, 2000, and July 31, 2002.  A decision by EPA to disapprove 30 
Tex. Admin. Code § 116.911(a)(2) would be unsupported by the record, arbitrary and capricious, 
and contrary to law.  At a minimum, EPA should clarify that its action on § 116.911(a)(2) applies 
prospectively only and does not affect existing permits issued under the SB7 program. 
Any replies or correspondence related to these comments should be sent to William A. 
Moore, General Counsel, Luminant, 500 N. Akard Street, Dallas, Texas 75201, or faxed to (214) 
875-9478, attention William A. Moore."

75 Fed. Reg. 64,235 (October 19, 2010)
Docket 10 No. EPA-R06-0AR-2005-TX-0031
Dear Mr. Barrett:
The Association of Electric Companies of Texas (AECT) is a trade
association representing electric companies in Texas.
Our members serve over
half the customer in the state and generate the majority of the electricity generated
in Texas.
On October 19, 2010, EPA proposed to partially approve and partially
disapprove revisions to Texas' SIP submitted by the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (""TCEQ"") on January 3, 2000, and July 31, 2002. See 75
Fed. Reg. 64,235 (Oct. 19,2010). Below is a summary of AECT's comments on
EPA's proposed partial approval and partial disapproval.
•
EPA's
proposed
disapproval
is
not
supported
in
light
of
EPA's
acknowledgement that collateral CO emissions authorized by the Pollution
Control Project (""PCP"") Standard Permit (""SP"") do not threaten attainment or
maintenance of any national ambient air quality standards (""NAAQS"").
•
EPA should follow its established position that Pollution Control Project
permits are acceptable under the Clean Air Act.
•
EPA's disapproval of 30 TAC § 116.911(a)(2) would affect only electric
generating facilities CEGFs"") that have already installed emissions controls
and achieved emission reductions under the PCP SP and, therefore, would
have only a retroactive effect.

AECT is specifically concerned with EPA's proposed disapproval of 30
TAC §116.911(a)(2), which required that each grandfathered EGF that had
proposed use of a new control method to meet the SB 7 emissions reduction
requirements also had to include in the application that was required by
§116.911(a) information to demonstrate that the new control method complied
with the requirements of Texas' PCP SP in order to be granted an electric
generating facility permit (""EGFP"").
In 1999, the Texas State Legislature passed Senate Bill 7 (""SB 7"") which
amended the Texas Utilities Code (""TUC"") and required the TCEQ to establish a
program that required grandfathered EGFs that were still in existence on January
1, 1999 to apply for a EGFP to authorize continued emissions of NOx, S02, and
PM from the EGFs. Applications for EGFPs were due by September I, 2000.
To implement the requirements of Senate Bill 7, TCEQ established a
permitting program for regulating grandfathered EGFs.
75 Fed. Reg. at 64,237.
On January 3, 2000, and July 31,2002, TCEQ submitted its revisions to the Texas
SIP to EPA wmch related to the applications and permitting procedures for
grandfathered EGFs.
On October 19,2010, EPA proposed to partially approve and partially
disapprove revisions to portions of Texas' SIP implementing SB7 and the
grandfathered EGF permitting program. In the proposed rule, EPA identifies two
facilities where collateral increases in CO emissions as a result of installing new
10w-NOx burner control methods were alleged to be above the PSD significance
levels.
We strongly disagree with EPA's assessment of these two facilities and
also disagree with EPA's proposal to disapprove ofthese already issued permits
The effect of EPA's disapproval of 30 TAC §116.911(a)(2) would be to
unfairly and arbitrarily apply permitting requirements retroactively on sources
that legitimately relied on the EGFP process and installed new pollution control
equipment to reduce emissions. EPA agrees that there would be no benefit to air
quality in Texas resulting from their disapproval of this section. See 75 Fed. Reg.
at 64,238 (""EPA believes that all of the resultant collateral CO increases across
the State of Texas (including those from the two plants) do not interfere with
attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS for CO, et aI., nor cause or contribute
to increase in PSD increments, much less a violation of any NAAQS."").
The SB 7 program is an important part of a successful permitting scheme
to require emission reductions of S02 and NOx, and achieve air quality
improvements in Texas.
Moreover, any collateral increases in other pollutants
resulting from the installation of pollution control equipment (such as increases in
CO after the installation of low NOx burners) are demonstrably not interfering

with attainment of air quality standards, as EPA has concurred. (See 75 Fed. Reg.
64238)
EPA's proposal should be revised to approve all of the revisions to the
Texas SIP submitted to EPA on January 3, 2000, and July 31, 2002. A decision
by EPA to disapprove 30 TAC §116.9ll(a)(2) would be unsupported by the
record, arbitrary and capricious, and contrary to law. At a minimum, EPA should
clarify that its action applies prospectively only and does not affect the validity of
any existing permit already issued under the SB7 program
As a practical matter, however, the Proposed Disapproval has a chilling
effect on much-needed economic investment and makes it even more difficult for
companies to create jobs and provide for economic growth.
The SB 7 program
has achieved
substantial
emission reductions
while
providing a fair
and
predictable regulatory framework that is protective of human health and the
environment.
EPA's concerns about Texas' SB 7 permitting program are misplaced
given the substantial improvements in air quality that have been achieved by
Texas' SB 7 permitting program, Further, if the Agency believes that any SB 7
permits may need to be revised, then there must be a fair and predictable
prospective process for making those revisions without causing undue harm to
companies that relied, in good faith, on the only program in place to permit
grandfathered EGFs - the SB 7 program that has been successfully implemented
by TCEQ.

hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

(Docket EPA-R06-0AR-2oo~TR-0031)
Dear Mr. Barrett:
On October 19, 2010, EPA Region 6 proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove a Texas
State Implementation Plan (""SIP"") revision that implements a mandate from the Texas Legislature that has
already achieved reductions in NOx and SO, in Texas. 75 Fed. Reg. 24235 (Oct. 19, 2010). EPA proposes to
partially disapprove one integral portion of the proposed revision, despite expressly stating that the portion at
issue does not interfere with attainment or maintenance of the relevant NAAQS, nor cause or contribute to any
increase in PSD increments. Id at 64,238 and 64,240.
Lurninant requests an extension of the comment period by at least 30 days to thoroughly review EPA's
proposal and to provide meaningful comments to the agency. This SIP revision was submitted to EPA over ten
years ago. EPA's October 2010 proposal is the first mention of the agency's intention to disapprove any of the
proposed SIP revision. In light of the length of time it took EPA to review the pending revisions and because of
the importance of this rule as applied to Lurninant and other sources in Texas, a 3O-day extension is more than
reasonable. Allowing this limited additional time will not prejudice any party interested in the approved rule,
nor should it unreasonably delay EPA's issuance of its final decision, and it shoUld improve the decision-
making process by allowing for more thoughtful participation in this process by interested persons.
Please notify me directly of your decision on this request and do not hesitate to contact me if you have
any questions.

Dear Administrator Jackson:  
 
As President and CEO of Memphis Light, Gas and Water, I am writing to echo the 
comments of the National Conference of Mayors and express my strong opposition to 
the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule to regulate Coal 
Combustion Residuals (CCR) as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C of the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). 
 
If EPA labels CCR as hazardous waste, costs for the management, disposal and 
transportation of these products from power generators would increase significantly, 
causing the electric rates for consumers in Memphis and Shelby County to increase 
dramatically.  Such a label would severely impact or cripple the market for beneficial 
use of these by-products in concrete and drywall, among other uses, which would 
further increase electricity costs.  
 
Treating CCR as hazardous waste would also create a financial burden and potential 
liability problems for cities and towns that operate landfills or use landfills to dispose of 
waste that might include coal ash.  The City of Memphis has a Tennessee Valley 
Authority coal-fired electric generation plant within the city limits.  
 
I believe that the other option available to EPA – regulating CCR as a non-hazardous 
waste under Subtitle D of RCRA – will provide adequate protection to public safety and 
the environment.  
 
Thank you for considering these comments.  
 
Sincerely,

Electing Electric Generating Facilities
Docket ID No. EPA-Ro6-0AR-2005-TX-0031, FRL 9215-1
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) provides the following comments on the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed rule referenced above. The proposed rule
was published in the October 19, 2010, issue of the Federal Register (75 FR 64235).
I. Background
In the October 19, 2010, proposal, the EPA proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove the
changes to Title 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter u6, Control of Air Pollution by Permits
for New Construction or Modification, submitted by the State of Texas to the EPA on January 3, 2000,
as revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The January 3, 2000, submittal included ncw
and amended rules in Subchapter A: ""Definitions,"" § U6.1S; and Subchapter I: ""Electric Gencrating
Facility Permits,"" §§ u6.910-914, 116.916, u6.920-922, 116.930, and u6.931. The EPA proposed to
fully approve all of the 2000 submittal but for the severable refcrence in 30 TAC § u6.911(a)(2) that
rcquired, for new control methods in initial applications, compliance with portions of the Pollution
Control Project Standard Permit (PCP SP) in 30 TAC § u6.617. The EPA proposed to disapprove 30
TAC § 116.9u(a)(2) which allowed the use of a PCP SP for the collateral carbon monoxide (CO)
emissions that were affiliated with the new controls. The EPA also proposed to fully approve certain
ncw and amended rules in 30 TAC Chapter 116 submitted by the State of Texas on July 31, 2002. The
July 31, 2002, submittal included new and amended rules in Subchapter A: ""Definitions,"" §§ 116.10
and u6.IS; and Subchapter I: ""Electric Generating Facility Permits,"" §§ u6.91O, 116.911, u6.913,
u6.917, u6.91S, u6.921, u6.926, u6.92S, and u6.930.
The TCEQ adopted these rcvisions on
December 16, 1999, and May 22, 2002, respectively.
II. Commcnts
Section u6.911(a)(2) was adopted by the commission to provide a means of authorizing collateral
cmissions increases for grandfathered electrical generating facilities (EGF) that were required to
reduce and permit sulfur dioxide (SOo), nitrogen oxide (NO,), and particulate cmissions (PM) under
Senate Bill 7, 76th Legislature (1999). The PCP SP provides a metbod to expedite the authorization
process for certain pollution control projects that do not necessitate a full case-by-case new source
review (NSR) permit review.
These SO"" NO"" and PM emission reductions from sources that had
been previously exempt from permitting bad the effect of improving air quality and supporting the
attainment of federal air quality standards. The collateral CO emissions increases did not result in any
increase in Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increments or a violation of the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards.
The EPA states in its October 19, 2010, notice that the PCP SP is not part of the Texas SIP and that the
EPA has disapproved it as a part of the Texas SIP. The commission acknowledges that the court's
opinion in New York v. EPA, 413 F.3d (D.C. Cir. 2005) disallowed the use of PCP SPs for major new
NSR requirements and left the EPA little choice in disapproving paragraph (2) of the rule. However,
at the time of adoption, this paragraph was in compliance with all applicable state rules and federal
regulations and policies.
Additionally,
paragraph (2) applied only to
initial applications of
grandfathered EGFs. These applications were required to be submitted by September I, 2000. This
section of the rule has no current application since this date has long passed and there will be no new
initial applications from grandfathered facilities.

f)(Jcf...el ,Vo
1~P.-I-R()(j-().-IR-2()()5-T\·-(}()31
Page:; 0/2
On September 23, 2009, the EPA proposed disapproval of 30 TAC § 116.617 (74 FR 48467), as
adopted by the commission effective February 1, 2006, and subsequently disapproved the rule (75 FR
56424, September, 15 2010).
This disapproval was several years after adoption of the rules to
implement Senate Bill 7 and the deadlines for the required permit applications.
The disapproval
concerned the version of the rule after amendments to 30 TAC § 116.617 were adopted in 2006 to
address prior comments from the EPA after the New York v. EPA opinion. The court ruled that the
EPA's rules that exempted pollution control projects from PSD review by defining ""modifications"" to
exclude collateral emission increases associated with those projects did not meet the requirements of
the Federal Clean Air Act.
Specifically, the amendments adopted in 2006 clarified that any project
that eonstitutcs a new major stationary souree or major modification as defined in 30 TAC § 116.12,
Nonaltainment and Prevention of Signifieant Deterioration Definitions is subjeet to the requirements
of 30 TAC Chapter 116, Subchapter B, rather than the requirements of 3D TAC Chapter 116.
Subehapter F. The eommission amended § 116.617 to eontinue the program to assist with the efficient
authorization method for installation of pollution control equipment for projects that do not trigger
major NSR federal review.
In its disapproval action, the EPA acknowledged that § 116.617 (as adopted in 2006) explicitly
prohibits the use of the PCP SP for new major sources and major modifications, thus addressing the
court's decision in New York v. EPA.
The EPA has not adopted any rules that provide detailed
requirements for this type of permit, nor any rules prohibiting it.
In fact, the applicable rule in 40
CFR § 51.160 is broadly written and has been interpreted by the EPA to provide states discretion to
tailor their own minor NSR permit programs.
As noted earlier, the commission's standard permit
program is part of the approved Texas SIP, and the EPA has determined it meets 40 CFR Parts!.
The TCEQ has proposed a new non-rule PCP SP and has received comments from the EPA regarding
that proposal. The executive director will present his response to those comments to the eommission
for consideration of a new non-rule PCI' SP.
In the interim, the TCEQ maintains its position that
9 116.617 is an efficient and legally supportable authorization for pollution eontrol projects in Texas.
The TCEQ PCP Standard Permit has been used to implement control technologies required by
regulatory changes; statutory changes, such as those in Senate Bill 7; and EPA consent decrees. As
such, control devices may be applied to numerous different facility types and industry types, ranging
from storage tanks to fired units. The TCEQ understands the EPA's comments and will work with the
EPA to develop an approvable authorization that will achieve the same goals and emission reductions."

the Texas Legislature that has already achieved reductions in NOx and S02 in Texas. 75 Fed.
Reg. 24235 (Oct. 19, 2010).
EPA proposes to partially disapprove one integral portion of the
proposed revision, despite expressly stating that the portion at issue does not interfere with
attainment or maintenance of the relevant NAAQS, nor cause or contribute to any increase in
PSD increments. Id at 64,238 and 64,240.
The Texas Mining and Reclamation Association (TMRA) is a Texas non-profit trade
organization comprised of approximately 100 mining, electric utility and supplier members. We
support coordinated, rational and consistent federal, state and local policies to assure the
economic recovery and use of this state's minable resources in an environmentally sound and
responsible manner.
TMRA requests an extension of the comment period by at least 30 days to thoroughly
review EPA's proposal and to provide meaningful comments to the agency. This SIP revision

Allowing this limited additional time will not prejudice any party interested in the approved rule
nor unreasonably delay EPA's issuance of its final decision.
Moreover, it will improve the
decision making process by allowing for more thoughtful participation in this process.

Docket No. EPA-R06-0AR-2005-TR-0031
Request for Extension of Comment Period
Dear Mr. Barrett:
EPA Region 6 has proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove the above-
referenced, decade-old proposed Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision that has
achieved significant reductions in S02 and NOx from Electric Generating Facilities (EGFs). The
permitting program at
issue was
initially implemented by the
Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) in response to a mandate from the Texas Legislature over 10
years ago. EPA is proposing this disapproval even though EPA acknowledges that the program
at issue has not interfered with attainment or maintenance of any NAAQS and has not caused or
contributed to any increase in any PSD increments. See 75 Fed. Reg. 64,238, 64,240.
The Gulf Coast Lignite Coalition (GCLC) requests an extension of the comment period
by atleast 30 days in order to adequately respond to the EPA's proposal, review EPA's data, and
gather additional data and information to support its comments. GCLC is a coalition of entities
that own or operate lignite and coal-fired power plants in Texas, LouisillIlJl, and Mississippi. In
Texas alone, these industries represent over 10 billion dollars in annual expenditures and over
33,000 permanent jobs.
A comment period extension for this matter will not prejudice any party interested in the
proposed rule, will not unreasonably delay EPA's issuance of its final decision, and will improve
the decisionmaking process by allowing for more thoughtful participation by interested parties.
GCLC believes this extension request is appropriate, particularly given the fact that EPA has not
previously indicated its intention to disapprove this proposed SIP revision.

Mr. Stanley Spruiell
Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ)
is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ1s current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal-fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global-warming
emissions and to make sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to continue polluting with global-warming emissions.
Please help us.
Our State government has been a pawn of the Coal
industry for too long.
It is clear that they are not going to help
us.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
Sincerely,
Dr.

Visiting other states and viewing the issues they face from long term
use of coal will run chills up your spine. Texas does not need to
consider putting any proposed coal useage in place.  We need to
consider cleaning up what we already have in use. Just the fact that
the State of Texas is in a drought prone area, and after the last year
this state just suffered, the water usage of coal operated plants
should be enough to make you rethink coal usage.  That water can be
used in a must more serviceable way for the peoples of our state.

plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all

requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.  Texans deserve better.  We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.  Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA1s proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal-fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean 'Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global-warming
emissions and to make sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to continue polluting with global-warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
I
am surprised that plans are on the drawing board to build 12 new
coal-fired power plant.
Older plants profit from littel or no
enforcement of clean air regulations.
This should stop, all plants
need to follow strict clean-air regulations.
We need to keep in mind
that investments in renewable energy is the best way to a strong
economic future.

Comments on EPA's Proposed Disapproval of Various Texas SIP Amendments - 
EPA Docket ID Nos. EPA-R06-OAR-2006-0133; EPA-R06-OAR-2005-TX-
0032; EPA-R06-OAR-2005-TX-0025 
Dear Mr. Spruiell: 
 
Bracewell & Giuliani LLP, counsel to the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council 
(ERCC), appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the three proposals referenced 
above.  ERCC is a group of companies that are committed to providing reliable and affordable 
power to American consumers and businesses.  Its members include electric utilities, mining, and 
transportation companies, and it focuses its public education and advocacy efforts on major 
legislative and regulatory issues arising under the Clean Air Act, as well as issues related to coal 
ash and climate change policy.  ERCC member companies provide electricity to millions of 
consumers and have spent billions of dollars in achieving beneficial environmental goals over 
the last decade.  
 
 
As a technical matter, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is 
simply proposing to disapprove certain revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
that the State of Texas would like to make.  As a practical matter, however, these proposals (the 
""Proposed Disapprovals"") have sent a signal that EPA may want to dismantle the comprehensive 
permitting program that Texas has developed and successfully implemented over the last decade 
– a program that has achieved substantial emission reductions while providing a fair and 
predictable regulatory framework that is protective of human health and the environment.   
 
These recent EPA proposals to disturb long-standing state rules have created enormous 
uncertainty -- not only in Texas but in other parts of the country as well.  This type of uncertainty 
has a chilling effect on much-needed economic investment and makes it even more difficult for 
companies to create jobs and provide for economic growth.  We urge EPA and the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to work together to resolve any legitimate 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 2 
 
DC\261792.1 
concerns regarding public health or welfare in a way that removes this uncertainty as soon as 
possible – and minimizes any uncertainty in the meantime.  
 
As discussed below, EPA’s concerns about the Texas permitting program are largely 
misplaced.  Given the substantial improvements in air quality that have been achieved in Texas 
over the last decade – in large measure because the State has been implementing the permitting 
programs now under dispute – it is hard to believe that these programs could actually be shown 
to interfere with Texas's ability to achieve the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).  
Most, if not all, of EPA’s concerns can be resolved through simple clarifications to the Texas 
programs – for example, by making it clear that the Texas programs do not supersede federal 
permitting requirements for new major sources and major modifications.  
 
We urge EPA to work with the TCEQ to ensure than any clarifications or changes are 
made and approved expeditiously.  TCEQ has laid out an effective framework for resolving 
EPA’s approval concerns, and ERCC supports these on-going efforts.  We also believe that EPA 
must keep the following points in mind: 
  
(1) The state program has created an incentive for companies to install pollution controls and 
implement other pollution reduction measures by giving them additional operational 
flexibility and reducing permitting delays.  These incentives are important, fully 
consistent with the Clean Air Act, and should be maintained. 
 
(2) EPA should take immediate steps to reassure companies that have projects already in the 
permitting process that they can continue under the current program.  If companies 
believe that EPA’s actions may be applied retroactively to projects that have already 
applied for permits, there is a substantial risk these projects will be put on hold, which 
will stifle much needed economic activity and cause irreparable harm. 
 
(3)  EPA should also affirmatively recognize and reaffirm the validity of permits already 
issued.  Any retroactive application of the Proposed Disapprovals to already-issued 
permits would create crippling uncertainty and manifestly unjust revocation of properly-
obtained government authorizations.  If the Agency believes that any such permits may 
need to be revised, then there must be a fair and predictable prospective process for 
making those revisions without causing undue harm to companies that relied, in good 
faith, on the only program in place – the program that has been successfully implemented 
by TCEQ.

I. 
EPA Has Failed to Demonstrate that the Proposed Revisions Interfere with Texas’ 
Ability to Achieve the NAAQS 
 
Unlike many other states, Texas state law requires that all air emissions from stationary 
sources receive authorization from the state.  TX HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.0518(a).  
Because of this absolute requirement for authorization of air emissions, together with the 
numerous and varied emission sources that must be authorized across the state in rural, urban, 
industrialized, agricultural, ozone attainment and nonattainment areas, Texas has developed an 
extensive program to meet the permitting and resource challenges.  See 30 T.A.C. § 116.110(a), 
which lists the required authorizations for all new sources and modifications. 
 
 
Texas' minor source program must also meet the statutory Texas Clean Air Act 
requirement for authorization of all emissions.  As EPA recently stated in its final Flexible Air 
Permitting Rule, states have discretion under the Federal Clean Air Act to implement the state 
minor source program as long as it does not 
 
interfere with attainment of the NAAQS. Aside from this requirement, which is 
stated in broad terms, the Act includes no specifics regarding the structure or 
functioning of minor NSR programs… As a result, SIP-approved minor NSR 
programs can vary quite widely from State to State. 
 
Operating Permit Programs; Flexible Air Permitting Rule; Final Rule, 74 Fed. Reg. 
51,418 at 51,421 (Oct. 6, 2009).   
 
 
Based upon those EPA-adopted principles that the state SIP must not interfere with 
attainment and that state flexibility is inherent in the NSR minor source permitting program, we 
respectfully request that EPA re-evaluate and withdraw the Proposed Disapprovals.  As 
discussed below, not only has Texas air quality shown dramatic improvement because the very 
measures proposed for disapproval have been in place, but the Proposed Disapprovals fail to 
recognize that the measures under review are similar to other approved state minor NSR 
programs. 
 
A. 
EPA's Proposed Disapprovals Do Not Meet Congress’ or the Courts’ Documented 
Standards for SIP Disapproval 
 
The Clean Air Act grants EPA the authority to disapprove a SIP revision if such revision 
""would interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further 
progress.""  42 U.S.C.A. § 7410(l).  Both legislative history and court interpretations tie EPA's 
determination of a revision that ""interferes"" with a state SIP to the ability of the SIP provision to 
achieve the National Air Ambient Air Quality Standard.  See S. Rep. No. 101-228, at 9, 1990 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 3385, 3395, ""The requirement that the States … submit [SIPs] to EPA for review 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 4 
 
DC\261792.1 
allows for federal oversight of the States' efforts to achieve and maintain the required level of air 
quality""; See also Train v. NRDC, 421 U.S. 60, 79 (1975) stating that ""EPA's most basic 
responsibility in reviewing air quality plans under the Act is to determine whether ""the ultimate 
effect of a State's choice of emission limitations is compliance with [NAAQS].""  EPA suggests 
that somehow this burden is placed on the State submitting a proposed SIP program.  This is 
simply incorrect.  If EPA were to actually promulgate the Proposed Disapprovals, it must explain 
how the state programs it is disapproving interfere with compliance with the NAAQS.  Without 
such findings and justifications, EPA's proposed disapproval would be arbitrary and capricious. 
 
 
Applying this review standard to both initial plans and SIP revisions, courts have 
recognized that ""in each instance the Agency must measure the existing level of pollution, 
compare it with the national standards, and determine the effect on this comparison of specified 
emission modifications.""  Hall v. United States EPA, 273 F.3d 1146, 1158 (9th Cir. Cal. 2001) 
citing Train v. NRDC, 421 U.S. 60 at 93 (1975).  In other words, ""EPA's analysis must 'rationally 
connect[]' its approval of particular plan revisions before it to its assessment of an area's 
prospects for meeting current attainment requirements. Hall v. United States EPA, 273 F.3d 
1146, 1161 (9th Cir. Cal. 2001) citing  Ober v. Whitman, 243 F.3d 1190, 1195 (9th Cir. 2001).  
Likewise, EPA must ""rationally connect"" any proposed SIP disapproval with an interference to 
achieving the NAAQS.  The Proposed Disapprovals fail to make that connection; rather, Texas 
air quality data demonstrates a consistent and strong improvement in air quality despite a 
growing population and economic development.   
 
 
B. 
Far from Interfering with NAAQS Achievement, the State’s Rules have 
Significantly Reduced Statewide Emissions  
 
The proposed SIP revisions subject to disapproval have been submitted for EPA review 
on a staggered basis since 1994.1  Since that time, the Texas' permitting program has 
implemented substantial emission reductions that have led to dramatic improvements in air 
quality.  These improvements can be demonstrated by reviewing both the records of emission 
reductions, and more importantly, the reductions measured by Texas ambient air quality 
monitors:  
 
                                                 
1 The Proposed Disapprovals report that the state provisions subject to the proposed 
actions were submitted to EPA for review during the following time periods: Flexible Permits 
(Nov. 29, 1994 to Sept. 11, 2000); Qualified Facilities (various provisions from March 13, 1996 
to Sept. 4, 2002); PCP Standard Permit (February 2, 2006); and Chapter 116 Rule Revisions 
(February 1, 2006).

Emission Reductions 
 
Houston Galveston Brazoria Ozone Precursor Emission Reductions. Despite population 
growth, vehicle and industrial expansion in the Houston-area, the largest and only severe 
ozone nonattainment area in the state, a key ozone-forming pollutant-- nitrogen oxide-- 
has been reduced by 57%, to 475 tons per day, since 2000.  Point sources alone have 
reduced the bulk of the NOx reductions in the Houston area by over 500 tons per day 
during the same time period.  
 
Electric Generating Units Emission Reductions.  Electric Generating Units in Texas have 
consistently been below the nation's average emission in lb/mmBtu for Sulfur Dioxide, 
Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Dioxide.  (Data from the Acid Rain Score Card (1995 – 
2002) and Clean Air Markets Division Database (2003 – 2006).) 
 
Electric Generating Units Emissions Rank Among the Lowest in the Country.  As of 
2008, EPA's Acid Raid Database reported that Texas' EGUs had the 9th lowest emission 
rate state average in the nation for NOx and the 19th lowest emission rate for SO2 in the 
nation.  (EPA Acid Rain Database, 2008.) 
 
Monitored Ozone NAAQS Reductions2 
 
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria Area Ozone Reductions. 2009 data places the Houston-
Galveston region's 8-hour design value at 84 ppb, below the 85 ppb 8-hour NAAQS 
standard.    That level represents a 25 percent reduction in from the 1994 design value of 
110 ppb, the year of the first SIP proposal.   
 
Dallas-Fort Worth  Ozone Reductions.  The Dallas area currently meets the one-hour 
ozone standard of 125 ppb and the 2009 8-hour design value currently measures 86 ppb, 
just slightly above the 85 ppb 8-hour standard.  
 
Beaumont Port Arthur Ozone Reductions.  The Beaumont Port Arthur area meets both the 
eight-hour and one-hour ozone standards and has since 2007.  
 
Statewide Ozone Reductions. The HGB, Dallas and BPA areas have all seen declining 
ozone design values consistently since at least 2003.   
 
 
 
As demonstrated by this snapshot of emission reductions and improving ozone data, it is 
clear that the revisions submitted and implemented over the course of the past decade have not

interfered with ozone attainment.  Quite the contrary, the specific programs have improved air 
quality, do not interfere with NAAQS attainment, and otherwise meet the requirements of Title I 
of the Clean Air Act and therefore should be approved.   
 
II. 
EPA's Proposed Disapprovals are Not Rationally Supported by Case Law and are 
Inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.  
 
In addition to EPA's failure to assess the single most important factor in the Texas 
permitting program, the promotion of continued air quality improvement, the Proposed 
Disapprovals are also inconsistent with case law and the Clean Air Act.  Because Congress 
placed the primary responsibility for developing SIPs upon the states, permitting programs 
among states can vary greatly.  It is left EPA to determine if the respective state SIP satisfies the 
minimum statutory criteria required by the CAA.  Union Electric Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246 
(1976), rehearing denied 429 U.S. 873 (1976); Train v. NRDC, 421 U.S. 60 (1975); Florida 
Power and Light Co. v. Costle, 650 F.2d 586 (5th Cir. 1979.)  Most recently the 5th Circuit 
recognized that ""the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a State's choice of emission 
limitations if they are part of a SIP that otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. 
§ 7410(a)(2).""   CleanCOAlition v. TXU Power, 536 F.3d 469, 472 Fn.3 (5th Cir. Tex. 2008). 
 
 
EPA has also recognized the State's role in crafting minor source NSR programs.  EPA's 
stated goal was to ""establish a flexible preconstruction permitting program for minor stationary 
sources…in order to create a more level regulatory playing field.""  Proposed Rules 17 Fed. Reg. 
48700/3 (August 21, 2006). This proposal also recognizes that ""outside of Indian Country there 
is a great variation among State minor NSR permitting programs."" Proposed Rules 17 Fed. Reg. 
48700/3 (August 21, 2006).  The following sections demonstrate Texas' respective permitting 
programs are based upon the recognized Minor Source NSR flexibility and consistent with prior 
EPA approvals of other state SIPs.  
 
 
ERCC has performed limited research of other SIP-approved programs throughout the 
United States.  It is incumbent on EPA to thoroughly review other state programs it has approved 
to ensure that Texas industries are not placed at a competitive disadvantage from industries in 
other states.  As described below, EPA is proposing to disapprove Texas programs that are more 
stringent than or consistent with other state programs and EPA's own proposal for minor sources 
on tribal lands.  EPA's Proposed Disapprovals are inconsistent with EPA's long-standing policy 
to allow States flexibility in developing permitting programs to address minor modifications.  It 
is not clear that EPA has invoked its SIP consistency process, but it must do so in this instance 
given this deviation from national policy.  See Memorandum from John Seitz, Director, Office of 
Air Quality Planning and Standards, State Implementation Plan (SIP) Consistency Process, dated 
April 4, 10, 1996.  EPA's Proposed Disapprovals could have dramatic impact on industries in 
Texas.  EPA should solicit comments from all EPA Regions on whether the proposed actions are 
inconsistent with other State SIPs and compare the stringency of the Texas programs to those of 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell

DC\261792.1 
other States.  ERCC is confident that EPA will realize that the Texas programs are consistent and 
possibly more stringent than other permitting programs throughout the United States.    
 
 
A. 
The Pollution Control Project Standard Permit Meets the State Minor Source 
Program Requirements (EPA-R06-OAR-2005-TX-0032) 
 
The statutory basis for the minor source program is section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act, 
which provides for the enforcement of the emission limitations in 110(a)(2)(A).  This provision 
provides the state with great discretion to establish Minor Source permitting programs.  Pollution 
Control Project (PCP) authorizations are not unique to Texas and provide an efficient 
authorization to allow pollution reduction measures to proceed quickly and without burdening 
the limited resources of the state permitting staff.  Additionally, EPA's concern that the PCP 
Standard Permit is too broad is misplaced and fails to recognize the regulatory restrictions in 
place, not to mention the benefits that allow efficient emission reduction projects to proceed in 
the state.  
 
There are at least two states with pollution control exemptions from the definition of 
modification, which allow pollution control projects to proceed with significantly fewer 
limitations than the Texas PCP imposes.  
Ohio.  EPA has approved Ohio's state definition of ""Modification"" that excludes pollution 
control or pollution prevention projects that the executive director has determined 
environmentally beneficial.  OHIO ADMIN. CODE 3745: 31-01 (VV) (iv).  68 Fed. Reg.

Oregon.  Pollution control projects that are determined by the Department to be 
environmentally beneficial are not considered major modifications.  OR. ADMIN. R. 340-
200-0020(66)(d)(B) (July 1, 2001) (EPA effective date, March 24, 2003). 
 
 
Neither one of the above referenced programs limits the pollution control exemption from 
permitting by a category of pollution control techniques or industrial sources.  In fact, both SIP-
approved provisions fail to provide any guidance for an application, executive director review, 
recordkeeping or monitoring requirements.  Ironically, it seems that the Texas PCP program is 
highlighted for disapproval because it placed too much emphasis on the requirements and 
limitations of the PCP program.  This attention to detail should not unfairly subject the 
authorizations to disapproval where other, broader, PCP authorizations are approved.  The Texas 
PCP program actually has more safeguards than the Oregon and Ohio programs.  Moreover,  
those programs seem to apply to the definition of ""major modification"" as used in the states' 
major NSR programs, which is a much more important aspect of the regulations than the minor 
modification program.   Texas' PCP program is solely a minor modification program.  It appears 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell

DC\261792.1 
that EPA is proposing to apply to Texas a vastly more stringent approach that is designed to 
judge Texas in a way that EPA has not proposed for any other state. 
 
 
EPA approved the general Standard Permit regulations in  the Texas SIP, which 
are the bases for the PCP program currently under review.  (30 T.A.C. Chapter 116, 
Subchapter F Sections 601-606; 610-611; 614; 615 (""Standard Permit General 
Provisions"")). Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans, Texas, Final 
Rule, 68 Fed. Reg. 64543 (Nov. 14, 2003); 40 C.F.R § 52.2270(c).  The state PCP 
Standard Permit meets the Standard Permit General Provisions and therefore has been 
approved by EPA.  There is now no rational basis to disapprove this particular Standard 
Permit program, especially when it is more stringent than programs EPA has approved in 
other states. 
 
 
The following chart outlines the key factors that EPA discussed in the approval of 
the Standard Permit General Provisions.  The right hand column delineates how the PCP 
Standard Permit meets these factors.

§ 116.615); and 
5. 
Public Notice provisions, including a 
30-day notice and comment provision 
for the Standard Permit (30 T.A.C. 
§ 116.603). 
The PCP Standard Permit was published in 
the Texas Register for public comment.  See 
31 Tex. Reg. 515 (January 27, 2006) for the 
final rule. 
 
 
Because the PCP Standard Permit was promulgated in strict accordance with EPA's SIP-
approved Standard Permit program, EPA has no basis to now second-guess and retract its 
previous approval, which was properly promulgated under the SIP-approved program. 
 
Furthermore, in no way is the PCP Standard Permit similar to the Pollution Control 
Projects exclusions to major NSR promulgated by EPA in its 2002 NSR Reform Rules.  67 
Fed. Reg. 80186 (December 31, 2002), vacated in New York v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3 (D.C. Cir. 
June 24, 2005).  Unlike the vacated EPA rule, the Texas PCP Standard Permit does not 
exempt from major New Source Review requirements those pollutants that may actually 
increase as a result of the installation of a pollution control device.  Nowhere in the PCP 
Standard Permit program does such an exclusion exist, and EPA has not identified any 
provision in the PCP program that would run afoul of the D.C. Circuit's opinion on this issue.  
The PCP Standard Permit is a minor modification program and within the discretion of the 
State of Texas' authority to address such modifications.  
B. 
Texas BACT Meets Federal SIP Standards and the Cited Deficiencies are not 
Sufficient to Propose Disapproval of the Entire PSD Program in Texas (R06-
OAR-2005-TX-0032) 
EPA's proposal to disapprove the of Texas's NSR program is based upon the Agency's 
proposed disapproval of Texas' SIP revision that deletes the reference to the PSD definition of 
""best available control technology"" (""BACT"").   74 Fed. Reg. 48467, 48472 (Sept. 23, 2009).  
Texas has an adequate and legally defensible definition of BACT, which is allowable under case 
law, EPA guidance and rulings from the Environmental Appeals Board.  Contrary to EPA's 
statements in the Proposed Disapprovals, States have flexibility in their definition of BACT and 
implementation of BACT as long as the statutory factors in the BACT definition are present in 
the state’s analysis.   
 
EPA has made no finding that Texas' BACT definition is contrary or less stringent than 
the Federal definition of BACT.  Accordingly, there is no legitimate substantive concern. 
Nonetheless, EPA is proposing the drastic action of disapproving the entire Texas PSD program.  
Such a disapproval would also discard all the benefits of the 2002 NSR Reform Rules.  EPA 
would place Texas permittees at a severe disadvantage to all other permittees throughout the 
country that have the benefit of the 2002 NSR reforms rules.  At a minimum, EPA should not 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 10 
 
DC\261792.1 
disapprove the entire PSD program and should simply work with Texas to address its concerns 
relating to the BACT definition.   
 
The proposed deficiencies fall far short of demonstrating an interference with achieving 
the national standard.  In addition, TCEQ has already committed to remedy the superficial 
deficiencies identified by EPA. Letter from Mark R. Vickery (TCEQ) to Lawrence E. Starfield 
(EPA 
Region 
6) 
(June 
5, 
2009), 
available 
at 
http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/assets/public/permitting/air/Announcements/tceq_airpermitting_epa.p
df.   See also Hall v. United States EPA, 273 F.3d 1146, 1160 (9th Cir. Cal. 2001) stating that  
EPA must consider anticipated revisions in determining whether the State will achieve 
attainment.  
 
The mere removal of a reference to the federal definition of BACT does not create a 
permitting deficiency or interfere with attainment.  The mere statement that the Texas BACT 
definition differs from the federal regulation fails to explain how it interferes with the state SIP.  
Many States have BACT definitions in their EPA-approved SIPs that do not conform, word for 
word, to the BACT statutory language.  See Connecticut - CONN. AGENCIES REGS. § 22a-174-1 
(EPA effective date, February 27, 2003); Maine  -  06-096 ME. CODE R.  § 100-17 (EPA 
effective date, November 21, 2007); New Hampshire – N.H. CODE ADMIN. R. ANN. ENV-A: 
§101.13 (EPA effective date, August 14, 1992); and Oklahoma – OKLA. ADMIN. CODE § 
252:100-1-3 (EPA effective date, January 7, 2000). 
 
Both EPA's and Texas' BACT definitions require the consideration of technical 
limitations, such as energy and environmental concerns, as well as the economic reasonableness 
of the emissions limitation, in order to determine BACT.   Compare 40 C.F.R. 51.166(b)(12) 
with 30 T.A.C. § 116.111(2)(C).  Further, both processes address the same fundamental concepts 
as expressed in the Clean Air Act.  The key question is whether the ""state permitting program 
provides a framework for adequate consideration of regulatory criteria and consistency within 
the PSD program.""   In re ConocoPhillips Co., PSD Appeal 07-02 slip op. at 30 (EAB June 2, 
2008) (quoting In re Cardinal, FG Co, 12 E.A.D. 153 at  161 (EAB 2005). 
 
Given the apparent equivalency of the result in applying the federal and Texas 
approaches to BACT analysis, it is unclear what basis EPA has to identify the “BACT 
Definition” as an issue sufficient to disapprove the SIP revision.  To the extent EPA is asserting 
that the TCEQ staff was required to follow the exact “top down” approach to BACT analysis, 
such an argument has already been disclaimed by EPA and the Environmental Appeals Board 
and rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.  As stated by EPA when it actually approved the Texas 
PSD program in 1992,  
 
“The EPA did not intend to suggest that Texas is required to follow EPA’s 
interpretations and guidance issued under the Act in the sense that those 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 11 
 
DC\261792.1 
pronouncements have independent status as enforceable provisions of the Texas 
PSD SIP, such that the mere failure to follow such pronouncements, standing 
alone, would constitute a violation of the Act.”  57 Fed. Reg. 28095 (June 24, 
1992) (Exhibit ED-16). 
 
During this same approval promulgation, EPA expressly confirmed that the State of 
Texas is not required to follow the EPA “top down” approach to BACT.  Id. at 28095-6.  
Likewise in the case of Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U.S. 
461, 476 n. 7 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court wrote:  “Nothing in the act or its implementing 
regulations mandates top-down analysis.” 
 
The ability to deviate from the top-down analysis is also supported by the Environmental 
Appeals Board, which has recognized in prior rulings the permitting authority's ability to vary 
from the NSR review manual as long as all regulatory criteria are considered and applied 
appropriately.  ConocoPhillips, PSD Appeal 07-02 slip op. at 30 (EAB June 2, 2008) (citing In 
re Knauf Fiber Glass GmbH, 8 E.A.D. 121 at 129-30 n. 14, 135 n.25.) 
 
Absent a showing from EPA that the Texas definition of BACT somehow inescapably 
leads to failure to consider and apply the appropriate regulatory criteria,  or inexorably leads to 
the NAAQS are not being protected, EPA must defer to the State's authority under the Clean Air 
Act to address air quality issues.  In fact, as explained above, Texas' air quality has substantially 
improved.  Furthermore, Texas' BACT definition has resulted in some of the most stringent 
pollution control emission rates in the United States.  EPA has not identified one instance where 
application of Texas' BACT definition resulted in less pollution control than if EPA's 5-step top 
down analysis was used.  The issue that EPA has identified is non-substantive and solely one of 
semantics.  There is no reasonable basis for EPA to disapprove Texas' BACT definition. 
C. 
The Qualified Facility Program Satisfies the Minor NSR Permitting Requirements 
(EPA-R06-OAR-2005-TX-0025). 
 
The qualified facility program meets the requirements of 40 C.F.R part 51 subpart I as a 
legally enforceable, protective of air quality, minor source authorization that was subject to 
public notice and comment.  In place since 1996, this minor source program has provided 
regulatory incentives to implement pollution reduction measures at existing facilities.  While 
EPA's proposed disapproval focuses on textual questions that allegedly fail to limit the program 
to minor modifications, it does not provide any evidence that this authorization is actually used 
for major modifications or in fact interferes with air quality improvements.   
 
 
Contrary to the purpose of the Clean Air Act, discontinuance of this program could deter 
or delay many pollution reduction measures because the cost and resources associated with a full 
notice and comment case-by-case permit would outweigh the economic benefits of the additional 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 12 
 
DC\261792.1 
controls.  Upon further review and consideration, EPA should determine that the qualified 
facility program satisfies the federal Clean Air Act requirements for a state minor source 
program and retract the SIP disapproval and finally approve this SIP revision.    
 
 
1. 
The Qualified Facility Program is Limited to the State Minor Source 
Program  
 
The qualified facility program mandates compliance with 40 C.F.R. §§ 51.165 and 
51.166, which requires any new major source or major modification to be permitted under PSD 
or NNSR requirements, by clearly stating that any change authorized by the qualified facility 
program shall not ""limit the application of otherwise applicable state or federal requirements.""  
TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.0512(c).  TCEQ regulations support this limitation by 
requiring that qualified facility changes must be documented minor source modifications. See 30 
T.A.C. § 116.117(a)(4) which requires compliance with NNSR and PSD regulations; see also 30 
T.A.C. § 116.117(d) stating that ""Nothing in this section shall limit the applicability of any 
federal requirement.""  EPA's dismissal of Section 116.117(a)(4) as a recordkeeping provision is 
unjustified.  74 Fed. Reg. 48450, 48457/1.  This qualified facility regulatory reference to the PSD 
and NNSR programs requires the regulated entity to document that the change is in compliance 
with the federal major source permitting programs and in compliance with state and federal law.  
 
2. 
The Qualified Facility Program is Protective of Air Quality 
 
The minor source qualified facility projects are limited in application and only authorized 
if the change does not result it 1) a net increase in allowable emissions of any air contaminant; 
and 2) the emission of any air contaminant not previously emitted.  30 T.A.C. § 116.116(e).     
The use of the qualified facility authorization is further restricted by the requirement that any 
facility eligible for the qualified facility minor source change must have received a 
preconstruction permit, which requires BACT review, within the past 10 years or uses pollution 
controls as effective as the BACT in effect 120 months before the change occurs. 30 T.A.C. §  
116.10 (11)(E).   
 
 
Like the qualified facility program, EPA's proposed Indian Country minor source 
program is based upon an increase of allowable and not actual emissions.  EPA stated that the 
use of allowables in the minor source program was based upon discretion provided ""in defining 
[modification] as [EPA] thinks best for the minor NSR program.”  71 Fed. Reg. 48701/2 (August 
21, 2006).  The EPA-developed minor source program also utilized emission rates in lieu of air 
quality impacts to determine exemptions from the minor source definition of modification 
because ""applicability determinations based on projected air quality impacts would be 
excessively complex and resource intensive.""  Id. at 48701/3.  Texas’ qualified facility program 
protects and improves air quality by limiting the use of this authorization to minor source 
modifications and providing incentives to implement emission reductions.

DC\261792.1 
 
 
3. 
The Qualified Facility Program is Enforceable 
 
In addition to the statutory and regulatory project emission thresholds and limitations 
discussed above, the regulations include enforceable registration and recordkeeping 
requirements.  Documentation must be maintained for all qualified facility changes that describes 
the change, demonstrates compliance with the qualified facility program as well as state and 
federal law.  30 TAC  § 116.117(a).  TCEQ regulations also require that, at a minimum, an 
annual submission is made to the agency documenting any qualified facility changes not 
incorporated into a facility permit.  30 T.A.C. §  116.117(b).   Additional notification and review 
requirements are imposed to assure appropriate state review and oversight of the qualified 
facility changes: 
 
• 
Pre-change qualification and approval is required for certain BACT 
determinations or where a MAERT is not available. 30 T.A.C. § 116.118 
• 
Pre-change qualification and approval required for certain intra-plant trading 
authorizations.  30 T.A.C. § 116.117(4). 
• 
Pre-change notification if a change will affect compliance with a permit 
condition.  30 T.A.C. § 116.117(3). 
  
 
EPA's general comments questioning the proper permit application or registration for  
qualified facility authorization are unclear given the minor source nature of the program and its 
function as an exemption from a preconstruction permit.  74 Fed. Reg. 48450, 48462.  The 
Program adequately imposes recordkeeping, reporting, notification and approval regulations to 
satisfy the minor NSR enforceability requirements.   
 
4. 
The Qualified Facility Program was subject to Public Review 
 
Finally, the public review requirements have also been met.  Although authorized by 
statute, the implementing regulations were subject to notice and comment.  Proposed on 20 Tex. 
Reg. 8308 (October 10, 1995) finalized on 21 Tex. Reg. 1569 (February 27, 1996).  EPA, in fact, 
commented on the proposed rule and agreed that it ""adequately addresses the applicability of 
major sources and major modifications with respect to PSD and NA permitting requirements""  
 
21 Tex. Reg. 1569 (February 27, 1996).   
 
D. 
The Texas Flexible Permit Program is Consistent with Federal NSR (EPA-R06-
OAR-2005-TX-0032) 
 
EPA should approve the Texas flexible permit program because it is consistent with the 
Federal NSR programs.  Texas' flexible permit program is a permitting ""bubble"" program that 
consolidates all emission limitations into a single permit and in no way allows circumvention of 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 14 
 
DC\261792.1 
major NSR permitting as suggested by EPA.  The concepts embedded in the flexible permit 
program have been part of the NSR program for many years and were upheld as consistent with 
the Clean Air Act by the U.S. Supreme Court in Chevron v. NRDC, 467 S.C. 837 (June 25, 
1984).  Texas' flexible permit program is actually more stringent than EPA's interpretation of the 
NSR program upheld by the Supreme Court. 
 
 
In defining a source for purposes of PSD permitting, EPA defined a ""modification"" as a 
significant new increase in emissions at a source.  See 45 Fed. Reg. 52676, 52747 (August 7, 
1980).  EPA later promulgated a plantwide definition of the term stationary source where it 
stated: 
 
Since the PSD definition defines 'source' in the essence as a plant, 
only new increases occurring at the entire plant need a PSD permit.  
For example, if a plant increased emissions at one piece of process 
equipment, but reduced emissions by the same amount at another 
piece of process equipment at the plant, then there would be no net 
increase in emission at the plant, and therefore no modification to 
the 'source.' 
 
46 Fed. Reg. 50766 (October 14, 1981).  The question before the Supreme Court was ""whether 
EPA's decision to allow States to treat all of the pollution-emitting devices within the same 
industrial grouping as though they were encased within a single 'bubble' is based on a reasonable 
construction of the statutory term 'stationary source.'  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 838.  EPA's decision 
to allow States to issue these types of permits was upheld by the Court.  EPA is now proposing 
an about-face that would ignore the discretion it gave States in the 1980's and that was upheld in 
the same case that EPA's relies upon so heavily in its defense of its own rulemakings to this day.  
As matter of fact, EPA's approved SIP for the State of Oregon includes a very similar and 
possibly less stringent program than Texas' flexible permit program.  Oregon implements a 
program called the Plant Site Emission Limit (PSEL) program.  The PSEL program could be less 
stringent that the Texas' Flexible Permit program in that the term ""major modification"" in the 
Oregon SIP is triggered only where there is an increase in the PSEL by an amount equal to or 
more than the significant emission rate over the netting basis.  OR. ADMIN. R. 340-200-
0020(66)(a) (July 1, 2001) (EPA effective date, March 24, 2003).  Once again, ERCC calls for 
EPA to perform a detailed analysis of approved SIP programs throughout the United States and 
initiate the SIP consistency process within EPA to ensure fairness to Texas industries. 
 
 
Texas flexible permitting program is explicit in that any new source or major 
modification to a source must go through major NSR and the Flexible Permit must be altered. 30 
T.A.C. § 116.805.  When a flexible permit is issued for a new source or major modification, all 
PSD requirements must be fulfilled, including installation and operation of BACT.  The fact that 
at the end of the day, the emission rates are reflected in a ""bubble"" permit is of no consequence 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 15 
 
DC\261792.1 
and is consistent with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements under the Clean Air Act.  
EPA concludes that the flexible permit program does not incorporate emissions limitations and 
other requirements of the Texas SIP, including monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements.  This conclusion is false.  The emission limits and other requirements in the 
flexible permit program are derived from underlying Texas SIP programs, whether it is a PSD or 
a minor source authorization.  The use of flexible permits is a well-established regulatory tool 
under the Clean Air Act and EPA should allow Texas, like other states, to exercise its discretion 
in development of its air permitting programs in this manner. 
 
 
III. 
EPA Should Recognize the Validity of Permits issued under the Texas Permitting 
Program and Refrain from Taking Enforcement Actions To Address EPA Concerns 
 
EPA has expressed in the past that it may consider addressing its concerns with the Texas 
permitting program through enforcement actions.  Any such enforcement initiative would create 
grave uncertainty by questioning past projects that were permitted in good faith and by stalling 
pending projects, which would seriously hinder job creation in Texas.  To avoid these 
consequences, EPA should issue a statewide enforcement discretion for sources that obtained 
government authorization in good faith and as required by TCEQ, the primary permitting 
authority in Texas.    
 
EPA should adhere to its own guidance on enforcement during pending SIP revisions.  
Michael S. Alushin and John Rasnic, Revised Guidance on Enforcement During Pending SIP 
Revision, March 1, 1991.  There is recognition that EPA has the ability to bring enforcement 
actions alleging violations of approved SIP provisions during review of SIP revisions.  General 
Motors Corp. v. United States, 496 U.S. 530 (June 14, 1990).  EPA guidance, however, explains 
certain criteria for EPA to consider in whether to bring enforcement actions during a SIP review 
process.  EPA must consider the following factors: 
1. Need for injunctive relief; 
2. For purposes of penalty-only cases, period of noncompliance in comparison to the 
length of Agency delay; 
3. Probability that the proposed SIP revisions will be approved; and 
4. Existence of a collateral suit compelling Agency action on the proposed SIP revisions 
indicating prejudice, and the degree of prejudice to potential Defendants. 
 
 
Applying these factors to the pending proposed Texas SIP disapproval justifies statewide 
enforcement discretion.  First, enforcement actions brought by EPA would not require any 
injunctive relief, as there is no evidence or demonstration that the proposed Texas SIP provisions 
excuse major NSR.  As discussed above, the proposed SIP programs provide sufficient 
protections of air quality and have resulted in valid permitting of minor modifications and major 
sources.   

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 16 
 
DC\261792.1 
 
 
Second, to the extent that EPA may consider penalty-only cases, EPA's substantial delay 
in addressing the SIP programs presents a great decree of prejudice to sources, and implicates 
due process concerns.  Sources have been authorized under these programs, in some cases well 
over a decade ago, yet EPA only recently started to comment adversely on permits and the 
permitting program.  Furthermore, complying with the proposed SIP provisions for the past 10-
plus years has not created any economic benefit to sources in Texas or presented any 
environmental harm.  The programs have actually improved air quality in the State and have 
resulted in the installation of pollution controls throughout the State that have benefitted, not 
harmed, the public health and welfare. 
 
 
Third, EPA cannot justify enforcement on these SIP issues based on the probability that 
the proposed SIP revisions would be disapproved, because as discussed herein the law does not 
support disapproval.  The SIP revisions before EPA are reasonable and consistent with case law 
and other EPA approved-SIPs throughout the country.    Any EPA action to disapprove these 
long-standing lawful programs would be counter to furthering air quality progress in Texas.  The 
proposed SIP revisions programs appropriately implement the statutory requirements by placing 
regulatory burdens on sources, such as emission limitations, recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements, and enforcing mandates to comply with state and federal laws.   The proposed 
revisions to the Texas SIP are lawful, and were reasonably expected by TCEQ to be approved by 
EPA.  EPA's Proposed Disapprovals were unexpected, untimely, manifestly unjust and 
prejudicial to one state, and are therefore not properly justified. 
 
 
Finally, because of the uncertainty and prejudice to Texas industries caused by EPA's 
unreasonable delay in addressing these Texas SIP programs, the BCCA Appeal Group has 
commenced a collateral suit compelling EPA action.  Under EPA guidance, this lawsuit 
demonstrates actual prejudice from EPA's delay on the SIP provisions.  Revised Guidance on 
Enforcement During Pending SIP Revision at 5.  Given the years of EPA's delayed response and 
years of sources being permitted in good faith under the Texas programs, EPA would have 
unclean-hands in any enforcement action to address these SIP issues.  Sources that have operated 
in compliance with the only applicable regulations on the books --  the Texas SIP programs -- 
should not be prejudiced as a result of EPA's inaction.   
 
 
Furthermore, EPA's involvement with the Texas SIP is a regulatory function and is not an 
appropriate opportunity for enforcement.  EPA enforcement should adhere to EPA's guidance 
against commingling enforcement and regulatory actions.  See Memorandum from Gary S, 
Guzy, General Counsel, to Steve A. Herman, Due Process Considerations Raised by Agency 
""Commingling"" of Enforcement and Regulatory Functions, September 21, 1999. 
 
 
While EPA may be tempted to address enforcement on a case-by-case-bases, most, if not 
all, of Texas' sources are in the same position.  One enforcement action against a particular 

 
Mr. Stanley M. Spruiell 
November 23, 2009 
Page 17 
 
DC\261792.1 
source for failure to comply with the Texas SIP regulations in place prior to the SIP Revisions  at 
issue would impose regulatory uncertainty and an inconsistent application of federal 
enforcement.   EPA should recognize that the SIP issues are best addressed through consistent, 
programmatic solutions and not patchy litigation.  The Proposed Disapprovals present unique 
issues in that the prejudice against Texas industries would be so significant.  Given the amount 
of prejudice and the impact any one enforcement case could have in the State of Texas, EPA 
should provide statewide enforcement discretion and commit to not bring enforcement actions 
against sources that have been in good-faith compliance with state authorizations over the years.   
**************************** 
We believe that EPA’s concerns about the Texas permitting program are largely 
misplaced, and that most, if not all, of them can be resolved through simple clarifications to the 
Texas programs.  EPA proposals to disturb long-standing state rules have created enormous 
uncertainty, which is having a chilling effect on much-needed economic investment.  We urge 
EPA and the TCEQ to work together to resolve any issues in a way that removes this uncertainty 
as soon as possible – and minimizes any uncertainty in the meantime.  
 
Thank you for thoughtful consideration of these comments.  If you have any questions 
regarding this submittal, please contact me at (202)828-5852.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA1s proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ1s current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal-fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean 'Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global-warming
emissions and to make sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to continue polluting with global-warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong
rul~s in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.Get the coal out of
Texas!

Mr.

We need air and clean energy today,
but business thinks differently.
You as the regulator have the responsibility to put in place strong
rules and the responsibility to enforce them.
Business is directed to
the bottom line and not necesarily for the right thing to do for their
constituents.
What are they doing to our water supply?
The world is moving towards clean energy technology.
Will Texas
follow?

Introduction
The Group strongly supports full approval of the Texas NSR reform provisions 
and definitions, including 30 TAC Chapter 116, Subchapter C regarding plant-wide applicability 
limits (“PALs”).  The Group further supports full approval of the minor NSR state pollution 
control project (“PCP”) standard permit codified at 30 TAC § 116.617.  The Texas air quality 
permitting program is stringent, comprehensive and protective of both the environment and 
public health.   
Under Texas’s integrated air permitting regime, air quality in the state is 
demonstrating strong, sustained improvement.  Between 1999 and 2005, NOX emissions in the 
Houston-Galveston area decreased from almost 1,200 tons per day, to under 600 tons per day.1  
Ozone as measured under the one-hour standard in the Houston-Galveston area has declined 
from 220 parts per billion (“ppb”) in 1991 to 127 ppb in 2009.2  Under the eight-hour standard, 
ozone in the Houston-Galveston area has declined from 119 ppb in 1991, to 84 ppb in 2009.3  
Moreover, between 1988 and 2008, there has been an 80% reduction in VOC compound 
indicators in the Houston area.4  There has been a similar improvement in toxic air emissions.  
Between 2003 and 2008, there has been a 50% decrease in highly reactive volatile organic 
compounds (“HRVOCs”) in the Houston area.5  Similarly, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, ozone

as measured under the one-hour standard declined from 140 ppb in 1991 to 115 ppb in 2009.6  
Ozone for the Dallas-Fort Worth area under the eight-hour standard has declined from 105 ppb 
in 1991 to 86 ppb in 2009.7  Notably, according to recent TCEQ review, all areas of Texas are in 
attainment for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.8
Further, the data show that stationary sources have contributed more substantial 
emissions reductions than any other category during the period of most dramatic air quality 
improvements.  In the Houston-Galveston area between 1993 and 2008, NOX emissions from 
stationary sources declined from 695 tons per day (“tpd”), to 156 tpd, a decrease of 539 tpd.9  
During that same period, emissions from on-road source declined from 416 tpd to 175 tpd, a 
decrease of 241 tpd.10  Similarly, stationary sources made significant decreases for VOC.  
Between 1993 and 2009 in the Houston-Galveston area, VOC emissions from stationary sources 
decreased from 411 tpd, to 170 tpd, a decrease of 241 tpd.11  On-road sources from that same 
period decreased from 199 tpd, to 86 tpd, a decrease of 113 tpd.12  As the figures indicate, 
stationary sources in Texas have made the most significant strides in reducing emissions.
The submitted revisions strengthen a previously SIP-approved Texas program. 
Under the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “Act”), SIP revisions are approved when those 
revisions do not interfere with the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(“NAAQS”).  States have the primary responsibility for developing plans for the attainment and 
maintenance of the NAAQS.  In fact, as the Fifth Circuit recently explained:
Although EPA is required to approve SIPs that provide for the timely 
attainment and subsequent maintenance of primary and secondary ambient 
air standards as well as satisfy other CAA general requirements, see 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(a)(3), the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a 
State’s choices of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that 
otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(2).13
Rather, the proper test for determining whether a SIP revision can be approved is whether the 
revision interferes with attainment of the NAAQS (i.e. that the plan does not make air quality 
worse).14  The last ten years have seen an unprecedented improvement in Texas air quality.  The 
submitted revisions have been fully integrated components of the Texas air quality permitting

program for all that time.  Because the current SIP submittals function to strengthen the existing 
SIP, such submittal does not raise interference concerns, and should be fully approved.
The Texas NSR rules track closely the federal NSR rules.  In instances where the 
Texas provisions depart from the exact wording of the federal rules, Texas has justified those 
departures.  The Texas NSR rules and associated rules are equivalent to the federal rules and 
should be approved.
II.
Substance of Asserted Deficiencies NSR Reform
EPA’s concerns on specific aspects of the Texas NSR reform are reproduced and 
addressed below.  Headings are for convenience only—all comments are intended to address all 
aspects of EPA’s proposal.
A.
PAL Provisions
1.
A PAL should only apply to existing sources with two years of 
operation.
EPA Comment:

“The submittal lacks a provision which limits applicability of a 
PAL only to an existing major stationary source, and which 
precludes applicability of a PAL to a new major stationary 
source.”
Group Response:
The absence of a reference to “existing” facilities is not grounds for disapproval 
of the Texas PAL rules.  Even absent a reference to existing facilities, the Texas PAL rules are 
substantively similar to and closely track the federal PAL regulations, as the TCEQ explained in 
adopting the Texas PAL program.15  The Texas PAL rules’ applicability provisions are 
consistent with the federal PAL program in 40 CFR Part 51, and should be approved as part of 
the Texas SIP on that basis.  
Moreover, the federal scheme contemplates that “new” units may be included 
when calculating the baseline actual emissions for a PAL.  In the 2002 preamble to the NSR 
reform rulemaking in which the final PAL rules were introduced, EPA explained how a PAL is 
to be determined:  “You must first identify all your existing emissions units (greater than 2 years 
of operating history) and new emissions units (less than 2 years of operating history since 
construction.)”16  The preamble goes on to provide, “For any emission unit . . . that is constructed 
after the 24-month period, emissions equal to its PTE must be added to the PAL level.”17

Additionally, EPA issued PALs before NSR reform and these PALs showed a 
degree of flexibility tailored to the specific sites.  For example, in its flexible permit pilot study, 
EPA examined a hybrid PAL issued to the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee.18  This permit 
consisted of PSD permit for a major expansion with permitted emissions based on projected 
future actual emissions in combination with a PSD permit for existing emissions units with 
allowable emissions based on current actual emissions at the existing emissions units.  According 
to EPA, that plant’s hybrid PAL permit enabled Saturn to add and modify new lines “in a timely 
manner, while ensuring that best available pollution control technologies are installed and that air 
emissions remain under approved limits.”19  
Texas’s PAL provisions are consistent with the federal PAL provisions, and so 
should be approved.  EPA concerns regarding the TCEQ’s implementation of the Texas rules are 
properly addressed through comments on individual permits, and not through a disapproval of 
the SIP revision.
2.
PAL provisions should track the federal PAL reopening 
requirements.
EPA Comment:

“The submittal has no provisions that relate to PAL re-openings, 
as required by 40 CFR 51.165(f)(8)(ii), (ii)(A) through (C), and 
51.166(w)(8)(ii) and (ii)(a).” 
Group Response:
The current provisions of 30 TAC § 116.192 regarding amendments and 
alterations of PALs provide adequate safeguards to ensure that appropriate procedural 
requirements are followed, both to increase a PAL through an amendment and to decrease a PAL 
through a permit alteration.  See, e.g., 30 TAC § 116.190(b), requiring the decrease of a PAL for 
any emissions reductions used as offsets.  The absence of rule language using the specific term 
“reopening” does not prevent the TCEQ from implementing and enforcing the program in a 
manner consistent with Part 51 and is not an appropriate basis for disapproval of the SIP 
revision.  The Texas PAL rules should be approved as a revision to the Texas SIP.


“Nor is there a mandate that failure to use a monitoring system 
that meets the requirements of this section renders the PAL 
invalid.”
Group Response:
EPA’s concern on this issue is not the absence of monitoring requirements in the 
rules.  It is, rather, about the absence of an explicit statement that a PAL is invalid absent 
monitoring.  This minor language issue does not rise to the level of requiring a disapproval.  
The Texas PAL rules make clear that monitoring is mandatory for a PAL.  The 
rules establish monitoring requirements in 30 TAC § 116.186(c) that are consistent with the 
federal PAL monitoring requirements.  Most importantly, the monitoring requirements are cast in 
terms of requirements that shall be met.  Examples include:

§ 116.186(c)(1):  “The PAL monitoring system must accurately determine all 
emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time.”20

§ 116.186(c)(2) further specifies requirements that shall be met for any permit holder 
using mass balance equations, continuous emissions monitoring system (“CEMS”), 
continuous parameter monitoring system (“CPMS”) predictive emissions monitoring 
system (“PEMS”), or emission factors.21
These provisions adequately address the monitoring requirements required under 
the federal PAL provisions.  Any additional statement that the PAL is rendered invalid unless the 
permit holder complies with these requirements is unnecessary in light of the clearly mandatory 
monitoring requirements that are equivalent to federal requirements.  
4.
All facilities at a major stationary source should be included in 
the PAL.
EPA Comment:

“The Texas submittal at 30 TAC 116.186 provides for an emissions 
cap that may not account for all of the emissions of a pollutant at 
the major stationary source. Texas requires the owner or operator 
to submit a list of all facilities to be included in the PAL see 30 
TAC 116.182(1), such that not all of the facilities at the entire 
major stationary source may be specifically required to be 
included in the PAL.”

Group Response:
EPA’s interpretation of the Texas PAL rules, which are consistent with the federal 
PAL, is not grounds for disapproval of the SIP revision.  The Texas PAL rules are substantively 
similar to and closely track the federal PAL regulations, as the TCEQ explained in adopting the 
Texas PAL program.  EPA concerns regarding the TCEQ’s implementation of the Texas rules 
are properly addressed through comments on individual permits and not through a disapproval of 
the SIP revision.
The Texas rules require that applicants for a PAL specify the facilities and 
pollutants to be covered by the PAL.  Specifically, an applicant must detail:
[A] list of all facilities, including their registration or permit number to be 
included in the PAL; their potential to emit, and the excepted maximum 
capacity.  In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate 
which, if any, federal or state applicable requirements, emission 
limitations, or work practices apply to each unit.22
This requirement closely tracks the federal provisions.
Moreover, logic dictates, and the federal rules recognize, that not every facility 
emits every regulated pollutant.  Under the federal rules “[e]ach PAL shall regulate emissions of 
only one pollutant.”23  
Additionally, EPA has recognized that states may implement PAL programs in a 
more limited manner.  In its 1996 proposal for the PAL concept, EPA noted: 
States may choose . . . to adopt the PAL approach on a limited basis.  For 
example, States may choose to adopt the PAL approach only in 
attainment/unclassifiable areas, or only in nonattainment areas, for 
specified source categories, or only for certain pollutants in these areas.24
The Texas PAL provisions track the federal regulations, and so should be 
approved.
5.
The federal definition of “baseline actual emissions” should be 
used.

EPA Comment:

“The submitted definition of the term ‘baseline actual emissions’ 
found at 30 TAC 116.12(3)(A), (B), (D), and (E) differs from the 
Federal definition by providing that the baseline shall be 
calculated as ‘the rate, in tons per year at which the unit actually 
emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month period.’”  
Group Response:
The substance of EPA’s concern appears to be that the Texas rules are missing the 
word “average.”  The missing term is not grounds for disapproval of the Texas definition of 
“baseline actual emissions.”  The omission of the term “average” from this phrase in the § 
116.12(3) definition does not render the definition invalid or inconsistent with the equivalent 
provision in 40 CFR Part 51.  EPA cites a distinction without a substantive difference, as 
application of the two definitions will reach the same conclusion with regard to the tons per year 
(“tpy”) emission rate over the 24-month baseline period.  The Texas definition of “baseline 
actual emissions” in the proposed SIP revision is equivalent to the federal definition in this 
regard and should be approved.
6.
PAL permits should be issued with 30-day public notice and 
comment.
EPA Comment:

“[T]here is no provision that PALs be established, renewed, or 
increased through a procedure that is consistent with 40 CFR 
51.160 and 51.161, including the requirement that the 
reviewing authority provide the public with notice of the 
proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a 30-day 
period for submittal of public comment, consistent with the 
Federal PAL rules at 40 CFR 51.165(f)(5) and (11) and 
51.166(w)(5) and (11).”  

“For PALs for existing major stationary sources, there is no 
requirement that the State address all material comments 
before taking final action on the permit, consistent with 40 
CFR 51.165(f)(5) and 51.166(w)(5). 3) The applicability 
provision in section 39.403 does not include PALs, despite the 
cross-reference to Chapter 39 in Section 116.194.”
Group Response:
EPA appears to be concerned that there is not an explicit reference to PALs in the 
public participation provisions.  The Texas rules make clear that PALs are subject to public 
notice and participation.  The absence of a reference to PALs in the applicability section of 30 

AUS01:566013.8
8
TAC § 39.403 is not significant.  Section 116.194 of the PAL rules provides the clear cross-
references to the applicable provisions of Chapter 39.25  A reference back from Chapter 39 to the 
PAL rules is redundant and unnecessary, and not grounds for disapproval of the Texas PAL 
rules.
7.
The federal PAL monitoring definitions must be included.
EPA Comment:

“The State also failed to include the following specific 
monitoring definitions: “Continuous emissions monitoring 
system (CEMS)” as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxi) and 
51.166(b)(43); “Continuous emissions rate monitoring system 
(CERMS)” as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxiv) and 
51.166(b)(46); “Continuous parameter monitoring system 
(CPMS)” as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxiii) and 
51.166(b)(45); and “Predictive emissions monitoring system 
(PEMS)” as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxii) and 
51.166(b)(44). All of these definitions concerning the 
monitoring systems in the revised Major NSR SIP requirements 
are essential for the enforceability of and providing the means 
for determining compliance with a PALs program.”
Group Response:
EPA appears to be concerned that the monitoring provisions are not separately 
and discretely defined.  The Texas PAL rules in 30 TAC § 116.194(c) contain monitoring 
requirements that are equivalent to the federal PAL rules.  The absence of definitions of CEMS, 
CERMS, CPMS and PEMS does not render the rules unenforceable.  The rules themselves 
identify and define each type of monitoring system, and identify federal-equivalent requirements 
that each monitoring system must satisfy.   For example:
An owner or operator using a continuous emission monitoring 
system (CEMS) to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the 
following requirements.
(i)
The 
CEMS 
must 
comply 
with 
applicable 
performance specifications found in 40 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 60, Appendix B.
(ii)
The CEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at 
least every 15 minutes while the emissions unit is operating.26
Similar requirements are included for mass balance calculations, CPMS, PEMS and emissions 
factors used to monitor PAL pollutant emissions.  The absence of separate definitions does not

impact the enforceability of Texas PALs.  The Texas provisions adequately address monitoring 
requirements for PALs, and should therefore be approved.
B.
Non-PAL NSR Reform
1.
The Definition of “facility” should be limited to an emissions 
unit.
EPA Comment:

“The submitted NNSR non-PAL rules do not explicitly limit the 
definition of ‘facility’ to an ‘emissions unit’ as do the submitted 
PSD non-PAL rules.”
Group Response
The term “facility” is defined in Chapter 116 and in the Texas Clean Air Act, and 
is used in a consistent manner throughout.  The term has identical meaning in the NNSR non-
PAL rules and the PSD non-PAL rules.  Any failure to “explicitly limit the definition” in one 
part of Chapter 116 is not grounds for disapproval, given the well-established definition of 
“facility” in the context of Texas air permitting and that it is comparable to the federal definition 
of “emissions unit.”
TCEQ regulations in 30 TAC § 116.10(6) defines a facility as: 
A discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure 
that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.  A mine, quarry, well test, or road 
is not a facility.
30 TAC § 116.10(6).  Section 116.10 states that the definitions contained in the section apply to 
all uses throughout Chapter 116.  30 TAC § 116.10 (“[T]he following words and terms, when 
used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates 
otherwise.”) 
This definition is similar to the definition of “emission unit” in Texas’s Title V 
rules.  There, “emissions unit” is defined as:
A discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure 
that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.
30 TAC § 122.10(8).  Under the express terms of § 116.10, the definition of “facility” is clear, 
and is equivalent to the federal definition of “emission unit” in the nonattainment NSR non-PAL 
rules, as it is throughout Chapter 116.

AUS01:566013.8

2.
The definition of “baseline emission” and “projected annual 
emission” 
should 
include 
startups, 
shutdowns 
and 
malfunctions.
EPA Comment:

The definition of the term “baseline actual emissions,” as 
submitted in 30 TAC 116.12(3)(E), does not require the 
inclusion of emissions resulting from startups, shutdowns, and 
malfunctions.
Group Response:
The Texas rules’ treatment of startups, shutdowns and malfunctions is not a 
proper basis for disapproval of the proposed SIP revision.  The federal and Texas definitions 
both require that non-compliant emissions be excluded from the determination of baseline actual 
emissions.27  Based on the Texas rules’ integration of pending Chapter 101 revisions on MSS 
emissions (as requested by EPA), the proposed SIP revision’s treatment of MSS emissions is a 
reasonable approach.  
EPA has approved rules for baseline calculations that exclude some of the 
elements they assert should be included in the Texas’s definition.  For example, Georgia’s PSD 
regulations give applicants the option of excluding malfunction emissions from the calculation of 
baseline emissions.28  In approving this approach, EPA noted “The intent behind this optional 
calculation methodology is that it may result in a more accurate estimate of emission increases. 
The federal rules allow for some flexibility, and EPA supports EPD’s analysis that the Georgia 
rule is at least as stringent as the federal rule.”29  Similarly, Texas’s approach to the baseline 
calculation attempts for a more accurate estimate of emissions.
Moreover, TCEQ is underway in permitting maintenance, startup and shutdown 
(“MSS”) emissions through Chapter 116 preconstruction permits, and a SIP revision reflecting 
the MSS permitting initiative has been submitted to EPA for approval.  The TCEQ is 
distinguishing between planned and unplanned MSS emissions, and working to authorize those 
planned MSS emissions in Texas air permits.  It is reasonable and appropriate that the MSS 
permitting initiative be properly integrated with the definition of “baseline actual emissions.”  
The proposed SIP revision recognizes that such emissions may be added to the baseline in the 
future, based on TCEQ’s ongoing process of authorizing MSS emissions.  The proposed SIP 
revision and the TCEQ’s current approach is sound and reasonable based on historical treatment 
of MSS emissions in Texas air permits, and is not grounds for disapproval of the proposed SIP 
revision.

The federal definition of “baseline actual emissions should be 
used.”
EPA Comment:

“The Federal definition of the “baseline actual emissions” 
provides that these emissions must be calculated in terms of 
“the average rate, in tons per year at which the unit actually 
emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month 
period.” The submitted definition of the term “baseline actual 
emissions” found at 30 TAC 116.12 (3)(A), (B), (D), and (E) 
differs from the Federal definition by providing that the 
baseline shall be calculated as “the rate, in tons per year at
which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any 
consecutive 24-month period.”
Group Response:
As stated earlier, the omission of the term “average” is not grounds for 
disapproval of the Texas definition of “baseline actual emissions.”  The omission of the term 
“average” from this phrase in the § 116.12(3) definition of does not render the definition invalid 
or inconsistent with the equivalent provision in 40 CFR Part 51.  EPA cites a distinction without 
a substantive difference, as application of the two definitions will reach the same conclusion with 
regard to the tons per year (“tpy”) emission rate over the 24-month baseline period.  The Texas 
definition of “baseline actual emissions” in the proposed SIP revision is equivalent to the federal 
definition in this regard and should be approved.

Group Response:
The cited provisions of the Texas rules regarding the 1-hour/8-hour transition are 
neither inconsistent with the CAA, nor the court’s decision in South Coast.  With its remand to 
EPA following vacatur of parts of the Phase 1 transition rule, the South Coast court did not offer 
specific direction concerning implementation of the backsliding requirements as they apply to 
NSR.  However, the court in its Opinion on Petitions for Rehearing “urged” EPA “to act

172(e) suggests that EPA must take definite action to implement anti-backsliding requirements:
If the Administrator relaxes a national primary ambient air quality 
standard . . . the Administrator shall, within 12 months after the 
relaxation, promulgate requirements applicable to all areas which 
have not attained that standard as of the date of such relaxation.  
Such requirements shall provide for controls which are not less 
stringent than the controls applicable to areas designated 
nonattainment before such relaxation.
42 U.S.C. § 7502(e) (emphasis added).  An October 2007 memorandum from EPA Deputy 
Administrator Robert Meyers stated that EPA intends to undertake rulemaking to conform the 
Agency's NSR regulations to the South Coast decision.   However, EPA has not yet proposed 
such a rule.  The footnote 6 and introductory paragraph cited in EPA’s proposed disapproval are 
consistent with CAA § 172(e) and not a basis for disapproval of the proposed SIP revision.
2.
The revision uses the incorrect applicability date under EPA's 
Major NSR rules.
EPA Comments:

“The rule, adopted and submitted in 2005, applies the date of 
administrative completeness of a permit application, not the 
date of permit issuance, where setting the date for 
determination of NSR applicability after June 15, 2004 (the 
effective date of ozone nonattainment designations). The 
submitted 2006 rule adds the date of permit issuance. 
Unfortunately, the submitted 2006 rule by introducing a
bifurcated structure creates vagueness rather than clarity.”

“[T]o the extent that the date of application completeness is 
used in certain instances to establish the applicability date, 
such use is contrary to the Act and EPA’s interpretation 
thereof.”

AUS01:566013.8
13
Group Response:
The applicability cutoff established in the TCEQ rules is not inconsistent with the 
CAA or EPA rules.  While it may be inconsistent with EPA’s interpretation of that rule language, 
the use of application completeness as an applicability date is not inconsistent with Part 51 itself.  
As a result, the applicability cutoff dates established in 30 TAC § 116.150(a) are not appropriate 
grounds for disapproval of the proposed SIP revision.  EPA concerns regarding applicability 
dates are properly addressed through comments on individual permits, and not through a 
disapproval of the SIP revision.
IV.
Pollution Control Project Standard Permit
1.
A standard permit cannot address site-specific determinations.
EPA Comment:

“A Standard Permit provides a streamlined mechanism with all 
permitting requirements for construction and operation of 
certain sources in categories that contain numerous similar 
sources. It is not a case-by-case minor NSR SIP permit. 
Therefore, each minor NSR SIP Standard Permit must contain 
all terms and conditions on the face of it (combined with the 
SIP general requirements) and it cannot be used to address 
site-specific determinations.”
Group Response:
The Pollution Control Project (“PCP”) standard permit does contain on its face all 
requirements applicable to its use.30  The rule requires that a permittee make a submittal to 
TCEQ, but does not require the Executive Director to act to approve the submittal.  Under the 
rules, if the Executive Director does not act, the authorization under the permit stands.  Review 
by the Executive Director is not to make case-by-case determination, but  rather to review for 
impacts on air quality and disallow use if air quality would be negatively impacted. 31  This is an 
important distinction.  The Texas PCP permit is more stringent than a program that lacks a 
discretionary denial provision.
Moreover, the PCP is a minor NSR authorization.  The CAA does not establish 
requirements for a state’s minor NSR programs.  The federal regulations that govern minor NSR 
programs at 40 CFR §§ 51.160-.164 provide states great flexibility in establishing SIP-
approvable minor NSR programs.  Indeed, EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board (“EAB”) has 
recognized the flexibility provided states in establishing a non-PSD, non-nonattainment NSR 
permitting program, noting that federal requirements do not mandate a particular minor NSR 
applicability methodology or test.32

AUS01:566013.8
14
In light of this flexibility, the Texas PCP standard permit is an acceptable part of 
the state’s minor NSR SIP.  Notably, EPA cites no statutory authority or provision of Part 51 in 
suggesting a bar on approval of general or standard permits.  The manner in which the TCEQ 
implements the PCP standard permit is reasonable and practical, and a decision to reject the PCP 
standard permit is a decision to reject an important minor NSR tool used by Texas sources to 
authorize environmentally beneficial projects in an expedited fashion.  Site-specific traditional 
NSR permitting for such projects is impractical, inefficient and detrimental to the environment. 
2.
A standard permit must be limited to a single source category.
EPA Comment:

“An individual Standard Permit must be limited to a single 
source category, which consists of numerous similar sources 
that can meet standardized permit conditions.”
Group Response:
As noted above, states have great flexibility in establishing the requirements of a 
minor NSR SIP.  In light of this flexibility, the manner in which the TCEQ has defined the PCP 
standard permit is an acceptable part of the Texas minor NSR SIP.  Notably, EPA cites no 
statutory authority or provision of Part 51 in suggesting a bar on approval of general or standard 
permits or for limiting the PCP standard permit to a single source category.  The manner in 
which the TCEQ has defined pollution control projects is reasonable and practical, and a 
decision to reject the PCP standard permit is a decision to reject an important minor NSR tool 
used by Texas sources to authorize environmentally beneficial projects in an expedited fashion.  
Narrowing the scope of projects that can qualify for the expedited standard permit approval (or 
requiring the TCEQ to promulgate source category-specific PCP standard permits for every 
source category in Texas) is impractical, inefficient and detrimental to the environment. 
3.
The Executive Director's discretion is not properly limited.
EPA Comment:

“There are no replicable conditions in the PCP Standard 
Permit that specify how the Director’s discretion is to be 
implemented for the individual determinations.  Of particular 
concern is the provision that allows for the exercise of the 
Executive Director’s discretion in making case-specific 
determinations in individual cases in lieu of generic 
enforceable requirements.  Because EPA approval will not be 
required in each individual case, specific replicable criteria 
must be set forth in the Standard Permit establishing 
equivalent emissions rates and ambient impact.”
Group Response

AUS01:566013.8
15
The Group reiterates the comments from Section IV.1 above.  Review by the 
Executive Director is not to make case-by-case determination, but  rather to review for impacts 
on air quality and disallow use if air quality would be negatively impacted.  The Texas PCP 
permit is more stringent than a program that lacks a discretionary denial provision.  Also, as 
noted above, states have great flexibility in establishing the requirements of a minor NSR SIP.  
In light of this flexibility, the discretion granted the TCEQ Executive Director in making case-
specific determinations regarding pollution control projects under the PCP standard permit is an 
acceptable part of the Texas minor NSR SIP.  Notably, EPA cites no statutory authority or 
provision of Part 51 in suggesting a bar on approval of general or standard permits or for limiting 
the Executive Director’s discretion in implementing the PCP standard permit.  
V.
The removal of the incorporation by reference of the federal PSD definition 
of BACT.
EPA Comments:

“The 2006 submittal also removed from the State rules, the
PSD SIP requirement at 40 CFR 52.21(r)(4). . . [This revision 
provides that] if a project becomes a major stationary source 
or major modification solely because of a relaxation of an 
enforceable limitation on the source or modification’s capacity 
to emit a pollutant, then the source or modification is subject to 
PSD applies as if construction had not yet commenced.”

“As the mechanism in Texas for ensuring that permits contain 
such a requirement, the State PSD SIP must both require 
BACT and apply the federal definition of BACT (or one that is 
more stringent) to be approved pursuant to part C and Section 
110(l) of the Act.”
Group Response:
Texas submitted a revision to 30 TAC 116.160(a) and a new section 116.160(c)(1) 
and (2) on February 1, 2006, as a SIP revision to the Texas PSD SIP.  This SIP revision 
reorganized the earlier SIP-approved rules.
Prior to the currently-reviewed revisions, Texas had incorporated by reference 
certain provisions of 40 CFR 52.21.  The current SIP-approved rule was adopted by the State on 
October 10, 2001, and EPA approved this recodified SIP rule citation on July 22, 2004.33    
Since 1972, Texas has correctly imposed a control technology review on 
applications for an air quality permit.34  Section 382.0518(b)(1) of the Texas Clean Air Act 
                                               
33 69 Fed. Reg. 43,752 (July 22, 2004).
34 See TACB, Regulation VI § I(B)(2) (July 5, 1972).  

AUS01:566013.8
16
(“TCAA”)  requires that “the proposed facility for which a permit, permit amendment, or a 
special permit is sought will use at least the best available control technology, considering the 
technical practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions 
from the facility.”35  This requirement is echoed in Section 116.111(a)(2)(C) of TCEQ’s rules, 
which requires that “the proposed facility utilize BACT, with consideration given to the technical 
practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions from the 
facility.” 36
The term BACT has been defined by TCEQ in strict accordance with the statutory 
BACT requirement in the TCAA.  Specifically, 30 TAC § 116.10(3) defines BACT as “BACT 
with consideration given to the technical practicability and the economic reasonableness of 
reducing or eliminating emissions from the facility.”  The TCEQ has stated that this definition 
shall apply to all use of the term “BACT” in Chapter 116 of its rules, unless the context clearly 
indicates otherwise.37    
The Texas regulations have continuously carved out 40 CFR 52.21(j), concerning 
control technology review, which is the federal BACT requirement, from the Texas PSD 
regulations.  This is true from 1992 when EPA first granted authority to Texas to administer PSD 
permitting.  As part of the 1992 approval, EPA explained why the federal control technology 
review requirement of Section 52.21(j) could be properly excluded by Texas under the federal 
Clean Air Act.  EPA explained:
This provision of the Federal PSD regulations has been excluded 
from the TACB Regulation VI because the TACB claims that the 
Texas Clean Air Act and the existing State regulations have 
provisions for application of BACT as stringent as the Federal 
requirements in reviewing the permit applications.  The EPA 
review of the Texas Clean Air Act and Regulation VI (Sections 
116.3(a)(3) through 116.3(a)(5)) have indeed revealed that existing 
TACB permit requirements meet the provisions of the Federal PSD 
regulations . . . .38
EPA then stated in the final rule approving the Texas PSD program that the federal control 
technology review requirement, which requires BACT for PSD applications, was “not necessary 
for approval of the Texas Program.”39
The preamble to the 2006 revisions to §116.160 in which the incorporations by 
reference of 40 CFR 52.21 were changed, demonstrate a consistency with the approach taken by 
the State in the preceding years.  The preamble explains the incorporation by reference of certain 
                                               
35 TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.0518(b)(1).

sections of 40 CFR 52.21 and further states, “[o]ther definitions used for the PSD program or 
visibility in Class I areas program are currently in [TCEQ’s] rules.”40  
The appropriate BACT definition exists in Texas’s rules, as demonstrated by EPA’s past 
approval of those rules.  All permits Texas has issued under the existing permitting program 
reflect the current TCEQ SIP-approved approach to BACT, and are valid and enforceable.
VI.
Conclusion
The Group strongly supports full approval of existing Texas NSR provisions and 
pollution control standard permit.  The Texas permitting program, including these provisions, is 
stringent, comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.  
Additionally, the Texas NSR rules track closely the federal NSR rules.  In instances where the 
Texas provisions depart from the exact wording of the federal rules, Texas has justified those 
departures.  The Texas NSR rules and associated rules are equivalent to the federal rules and 
should be approved.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reclassified the eight-county 
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area from a moderate to a severe nonattainment area for the 
1997 eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) effective on October 
31, 2008.  The HGB eight-county area includes Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, 
Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties.  The EPA set April 15, 2010, as the date for 
the state to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) revision addressing the severe ozone 
nonattainment area requirements of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments (FCAA).  The 
HGB area must attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard of 0.08 parts per million (ppm) as 
expeditiously as practicable but no later than the attainment date of June 15, 2019.  Since 
emission reductions needed for attainment must be implemented by the beginning of the ozone 
season immediately preceding the HGB area’s attainment date, implementation of controls need 
to be made by 2018, which is the attainment year for modeling. 
 
This SIP revision addresses ozone formation in the HGB area, the precursor emissions of nitrogen 
oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), the control strategies that are to be 
implemented, the quantity of emission reductions associated with each strategy, and when these 
reductions will occur.  Based on photochemical modeling and an evaluation of corroborative 
evidence, ozone measurements in the HGB area are predicted to be compliant with the 1997 
eight-hour ozone NAAQS by June 15, 2019. 
 
The existing measures to control ozone formation in the HGB area that have been adopted in 
previous SIP revisions center on: 
 
• 
approximately 80 percent NOX emission reductions from point sources through the Mass 
Emission Cap and Trade (MECT) program; 
• 
NOX emission reductions from on-road and non-road sources through the vehicle 
inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, the Texas Emission Reduction Plan (TERP), 
and the Texas Low Emission Diesel (TxLED) program; 
• 
highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) controls through the associated 
HRVOC Emission Cap and Trade (HECT) program; and 
• 
VOC controls. 
 
See Chapter 4, Control Strategies and Required Elements, Section 4.2, Existing Control 
Measures for a complete list of control measures. 
 
Despite the significant decreases in one-hour and eight-hour ozone design values and in NOX  and 
VOC emissions in the HGB area, further reductions are needed to bring the area into attainment 
of the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS.  Even as key ozone-targeting regulatory programs have 
reduced the number and magnitude of ozone exceedances, the area of exceedance, and the 
population exposed to exceedances, economic and population growth continue to create air 
quality challenges for the HGB area. 
 
This submittal contains proposed new state and local control measures.  The Houston-Galveston 
Area Council (H-GAC), as the regional metropolitan transportation planning agency for the HGB 
area, has identified three voluntary programs that will aid in the improvement of the HGB area’s 
air quality. The H-GAC’s commitment for NOX  emissions reductions from the Voluntary Mobile 
Emission Reduction Program (VMEP) is 2.25 tons per day (tpd).  The H-GAC has also identified 
transportations control measures (TCMs) that have been or will be implemented in the 
 
i 

 
nonattainment area.  By the start of the 2018 ozone season, these TCMs will reduce NOX 
emissions in the HGB area by 0.015 tpd. 
 
Photochemical modeling analysis demonstrates that a 25 percent reduction of the HECT cap on 
the total Harris County HRVOC allocation would contribute to attainment of the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone NAAQS by reducing the future 2018 ozone design values at all HGB monitors.  
Accordingly, this SIP revision contains a proposed 25 percent reduction in the total HRVOC 
allowance cap and revision to the HRVOC allocation methodology.  The HECT program will 
continue to be applicable only in Harris County. 
 
This plan demonstrates attainment using photochemical modeling that includes the existing and 
proposed control strategies previously listed.  The demonstration also relies on weight of 
evidence (WoE) corroborative analysis and additional control measures not explicitly accounted 
for in the photochemical modeling (see Chapter 5, Weight of Evidence). 
 
This SIP revision includes base case modeling of representative ozone exceedance episodes that 
occurred during 2005 and 2006.  In general, the model performance evaluation of the base cases 
for 2005 and 2006 indicates the modeling is suitable for use in conducting the modeling 
attainment test.  The modeling attainment test was applied by modeling a 2006 baseline year and 
2018 future year to project 2018 eight-hour ozone design values.  Only two regulatory monitors, 
Deer Park (DRPK) and Bayland Park (BAYP), and one non-regulatory monitor, Wallisville 
(WALV), are projected to have modeled 2018 eight-hour ozone design values greater than the 
1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. 
 
Modeling analyses of the sensitivity of the 2018 projected eight-hour ozone design values to 
emission reductions of NOX and VOC generally indicate that the ozone design values are more 
sensitive to NOX reductions than VOC.  However, the sensitivity of ozone design values to 
reductions in HRVOC is much greater than for other VOC.   
 
Table ES-1:  Summary of 2006 Baseline, 2018 Future Year, and 2018 Control Strategy 
Anthropogenic Modeling Emissions for HGB lists the anthropogenic modeling emissions in tons 
per day (tpd) by source category for the 2006 baseline, 2018 future year, and the 2018 control 
strategies for NOX and VOC.  The differences in modeling emissions between the 2006 baseline 
and the 2018 future year reflect the net of growth and existing controls.  The existing controls 
include both state and federal measures that have already been promulgated.  The differences in 
modeling emissions between the 2018 future year and the 2018 control strategy reflect the 
proposed controls.  These proposed controls include NOX reductions from both the VMEP 
measures and TCMs, and the 25 percent reduction in the Harris County total HRVOC cap for the 
HECT program.

values in parts per billion (ppb) for the 2006 baseline (DVB), 2018 baseline future year (DVF), 
and 2018 control strategy for the two regulatory monitors with model-projected 2018 eight-hour 
ozone design values greater than the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS.  However, 18 regulatory 
monitors have model-projected 2018 eight-hour ozone design values less than the 1997 eight-
hour ozone NAAQS.  Since the modeling cannot provide an absolute prediction of future year 
ozone design values, additional information from corroborative analyses are used in assessing 
whether the area will attain the standard in the future year.

This SIP revision provides ozone reduction trends analyses and supplementary data to 
demonstrate that the HGB eight-county nonattainment area will attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone 
standard of 0.08 ppm (84 parts per billion (ppb)).  The EPA’s April 2007 “Guidance on the Use 
of Models and Other Analyses for Demonstrating Attainment of Air Quality Goals for Ozone, 
PM2.5, and Regional Haze” states that a weight of evidence demonstration is allowed when the 
future design value is at or below 87.9 ppb.  The quantitative and qualitative corroborative 
analyses in Chapter 5, Weight of Evidence, support a conclusion that this SIP revision 
demonstrates attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. 
 
This revision also includes FCAA-required SIP elements, including a reasonably available control 
measures (RACM) analysis, a reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis, a motor 
vehicle emissions budget (MVEB), and a contingency plan.  For the MVEB, see Table ES-3:

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is committed to developing and 
applying the best science and technology towards addressing and reducing ozone formation in 
HGB and other nonattainment areas in Texas.  This SIP revision also includes a description of 
how the TCEQ continues to use new technology, such as infrared VOC imaging to identify and 
control unaddressed or under-addressed pollution sources, to investigate possible emission 
reduction strategies, and other practical methods to continue making progress in air quality 
improvement.  For more information, see Chapter 6, Ongoing and Future Initiatives.

SECTION V:  LEGAL AUTHORITY 
 
A.  General 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has the legal authority to implement, 
maintain, and enforce the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to control the 
quality of the state’s air, including maintaining adequate visibility. 
 
The first air pollution control act, known as the Clean Air Act of Texas, was passed by the Texas 
Legislature in 1965.  In 1967, the Clean Air Act of Texas was superseded by a more 
comprehensive statute, the Texas Clean Air Act (TCAA), found in Article 4477-5, Vernon’s 
Texas Civil Statutes.  The legislature amended the TCAA in 1969, 1971, 1973, 1979, 1985, 1987, 
1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009.  In 1989, the TCAA was 
codified as Chapter 382 of the Texas Health & Safety Code.   
 
Originally, the TCAA stated that the Texas Air Control Board (TACB) is the state air pollution 
control agency and is principal authority in the state on matters relating to the quality of air 
resources.  In 1991, the legislature abolished the TACB effective September 1, 1993, and its 
powers, duties, responsibilities, and functions were transferred to the Texas Natural Resource 
Conservation Commission (TNRCC).  With the creation of the TNRCC, the authority over air 
quality is found in both the Texas Water Code and the TCAA.  Specifically, the authority of the 
TNRCC is found in Chapters 5 and 7.  Chapter 5, Subchapters A - F, H - J, and L, include the 
general provisions, organization, and general powers and duties of the TNRCC, and the 
responsibilities and authority of the executive director.  This chapter also authorizes the TNRCC 
to implement action when emergency conditions arise, and to conduct hearings.  Chapter 7 gives 
the TNRCC enforcement authority.  In 2001, the 77th Texas Legislature continued the existence 
of the TNRCC until September 1, 2013, and changed the name of the TNRCC to the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).  In 2009, the 81st Texas Legislature, during a 
special session, amended § 5.014 of the Texas Water Code, changing the expiration date of the 
TCEQ to September 1, 2011, unless continued in existence by the Texas Sunset Act. 
 
The TCAA specifically authorizes the TCEQ to establish the level of quality to be maintained in 
the state’s air and to control the quality of the state’s air by preparing and developing a general, 
comprehensive plan.  The TCAA, Subchapters A - D, also authorize the TCEQ to collect 
information to enable the commission to develop an inventory of emissions; to conduct research 
and investigations; to enter property and examine records; to prescribe monitoring requirements; 
to institute enforcement proceedings; to enter into contracts and execute instruments; to formulate 
rules; to issue orders taking into consideration factors bearing upon health, welfare, social and 
economic factors, and practicability and reasonableness; to conduct hearings; to establish air 
quality control regions; to encourage cooperation with citizens’ groups and other agencies and 
political subdivisions of the state as well as with industries and the federal government; and to 
establish and operate a system of permits for construction or modification of facilities.   
 
Local government authority is found in Subchapter E of the TCAA.  Local governments have the 
same power as the TCEQ to enter property and make inspections.  They also may make 
recommendations to the Commission concerning any action of the TCEQ that affects their 
territorial jurisdiction, may bring enforcement actions, and may execute cooperative agreements 
with the TCEQ or other local governments.  In addition, a city or town may enact and enforce 
ordinances for the control and abatement of air pollution not inconsistent with the provisions of 
the TCAA and the rules or orders of the Commission. 
 
 
v 

 
Subchapters G and H of the TCAA authorize the TCEQ to establish vehicle inspection and 
maintenance programs in certain areas of the state, consistent with the requirements of the federal 
Clean Air Act; coordinate with federal, state, and local transportation planning agencies to 
develop and implement transportation programs and measures necessary to attain and maintain 
the NAAQS; establish gasoline volatility and low emission diesel standards; and fund and 
authorize participating counties to implement vehicle repair assistance, retrofit, and accelerated 
vehicle retirement programs.

CHAPTER 1:  GENERAL 
 
1.1  BACKGROUND 
The “History of the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP),” a comprehensive overview of the 
SIP revisions submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the 
State of Texas, is available at the following Web site: 
 http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/sip/sipintro.html#History. 
 
1.2  INTRODUCTION 
The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area’s hot, sunny climate, large urban population 
activities, and extensive, highly concentrated industrial complex provide the ingredients for ozone 
formation:  sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NOX), and volatile organic compounds (VOC).  The 
Houston area’s significant biogenic VOC emissions and complex meteorology, which includes 
land/sea breeze air parcel recirculation, complicate air quality modeling.  Economic and 
population growth continue to create air quality challenges for the HGB area.  However, key 
ozone-targeting regulatory programs have reduced the number and magnitude of ozone 
exceedances, the area of exceedance, and the population exposed to exceedances. 
 
1.2.1  One-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) History 
The EPA established the one-hour ozone NAAQS of 0.08 parts per million (ppm) in the April 30, 
1971, issue of the Federal Register (36 FR 8186).  The EPA revised the one-hour ozone standard 
to 0.12 ppm in the February 8, 1979, issue of the Federal Register (44 FR 4202).  The eight-
county HGB area, defined as Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, 
Montgomery, and Waller Counties, was first designated as a nonattainment area for the one-hour 
ozone NAAQS established by the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) in the November 6, 1991, issue 
of the Federal Register (56 FR 56694).  The HGB area was classified as a Severe-17 
nonattainment area, which required it to attain the one-hour ozone NAAQS by November 15, 
2007.  The one-hour ozone NAAQS was revoked in the June 15, 2005, issue of the Federal 
Register (69 FR 23951). 
 
The following summaries of HGB area one-hour ozone SIP revisions are provided to give context 
and greater understanding of the complex issues involved in HGB’s ozone challenge.  For a 
summary of ozone SIP revisions in the HGB area prior to December 2000, please refer to the 
“History of the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP),” mentioned in Section 1.1 of this chapter.  
 
1.2.1.1  December 2000 
The Post-1999 Rate-of-Progress (ROP) and Attainment Demonstration SIP for the 
Houston/Galveston Ozone Nonattainment Area revision contained rules and photochemical 
modeling analyses in support of the HGB one-hour ozone attainment demonstration.  The 
majority of the emission reductions identified in this revision resulted from an overall 90 percent 
reduction in point source NOX implemented through 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 
Chapter 117 and the Mass Emissions Cap and Trade (MECT) program in 30 TAC Chapter 101.  
A modeling analysis, which showed a 141 parts per billion (ppb) peak ozone level, indicated a 
shortfall of 91 tons per day (tpd) in NOX emissions reductions that were necessary, but not readily 
available, for an approvable attainment demonstration.  In addition, the revision contained a post-
1999 ROP plan for the milestone years 2002 and 2005, as well as the attainment year 2007, and 
transportation conformity motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for NOX and VOC.  The 
SIP revision also contained enforceable commitments to implement further measures (in support 
of the HGB area’s attainment demonstration and to remedy the estimated 91 tpd shortfall), 
Voluntary Mobile Emission Reduction Program (VMEP) measures, as well as a commitment to 
perform and submit a mid-course review (MCR) to the EPA.

ROP 
and 
Attainment 
Demonstration 
Follow-Up 
SIP 
for 
the 
Houston/Galveston Ozone Nonattainment Area revision included the following elements: 1) 
corrections to the ROP table/budget for the years 2002, 2005, and 2007 due to a mathematical 
error; 2) incorporation of a change to the idling restriction control strategy, which clarified that 
the operator of a rented or leased vehicle is responsible for compliance with the requirements in 
situations where the operator of a leased or rented vehicle is not employed by the owner of the 
vehicle; 3) incorporation of revisions to the clean diesel fuel rules to provide greater flexibility in 
complying with the rule requirements while preserving the emission reductions previously 
represented; 4) incorporation of a stationary diesel engine rule; 5) incorporation of revisions to 
the point source NOX rules; 6) incorporation of revisions to the NOX emissions cap and trade 
rules; 7) removal of the construction equipment operating restriction and the accelerated purchase 
requirement for Tier 2/Tier 3 heavy-duty equipment; 8) replacement of the Tier 2/Tier 3 rules 
with the Texas Emission Reduction Plan (TERP); 9) layout of the MCR process that detailed how 
the state would fulfill the commitment to obtain the additional emission reductions necessary to 
demonstrate attainment of the one-hour ozone standard in the HGB area; and 10) replacement of 
the 2007 ROP MVEB to be consistent with the attainment demonstration MVEB. 
 
Despite the NOX measures adopted in the December 2000 SIP revision and the stationary diesel 
engine rules included in the September 2001 SIP revision, an estimated 56 tpd NOX reduction 
shortfall remained.  The state committed to address the remaining shortfall through the MCR 
process.  The EPA approved the December 2000 and September 2001 submittals in the 
November 14, 2001, issue of the Federal Register (66 FR 57160). 
 
1.2.1.3  December 2002 
In January 2001, the Business Coalition for Clean Air-Appeal Group (BCCA-AG) and several 
regulated companies challenged the December 2000 HGB SIP revision and the 90 percent NOX 
reduction requirement from stationary sources.  Among other things, BCCA-AG contended that 
the last 10 percent of the NOX emissions reductions were not cost effective and that the ozone 
plan would fail because the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) did not 
account for VOC emissions associated with upset conditions.  In May 2001, the parties agreed to 
a stay in the case, and Judge Margaret Cooper, Travis County District Court, signed a Consent 
Order, effective June 8, 2001.  The order required the commission to perform an independent and 
thorough analysis of the causes of rapid ozone formation events and to identify potential 
mitigating measures not yet included in the HGB attainment demonstration. 
 
In compliance with the Consent Order, the commission conducted a scientific evaluation based in 
large part on aircraft data collected by the Texas Air Quality Study 2000 (TexAQS 2000).  The 
TexAQS 2000 was a comprehensive research project, conducted in August and September 2000, 
involving more than 40 research organizations and over 200 scientists that studied ground-level 
ozone air pollution in the HGB and east Texas regions.  These and other studies suggested that 
the HGB area’s high ozone events can be attributed, in part, to the presence of significant 
reactivity in the airshed.  An analysis of automated gas chromatograph data revealed that four 
highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) were frequently responsible for high 
reactivity days:  ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes.  As such, these compounds 
were selected as the best candidates for HRVOC emission controls.  Analysis showed that the 
ozone control strategy involving limits on emissions of ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, and 
butenes from industrial sources, in conjunction with an 80 percent reduction in industrial or point 
source NOX, was equivalent or better in terms of air quality benefit than the previous ozone 
control strategy (a 90 percent point source NOX emissions reduction requirement alone).  
Therefore, in December 2002, the TCEQ adopted a SIP revision that replaced 10 percent of 
industrial point source NOX emissions reductions with industrial source HRVOC controls.  
HRVOC is defined in 30 TAC Chapter 115 as ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, and all isomers 
of butene for Harris County and ethylene and propylene for the other seven counties in the HGB 
area.  The result was an industrial source ozone control strategy that relies on an 80 percent 

 
1-3
reduction in NOX emissions through Chapter 117 and the MECT program, and HRVOC rules in 
Chapter 115 that better quantify and reduce emissions of HRVOC from four key industrial 
sources:  fugitives, flares, process vents, and cooling tower heat exchange systems.  The HRVOC 
fugitive emission controls are more stringent leak detection and repair requirements for 
components in HRVOC service such as valves and flanges.  The HRVOC rules for flares, process 
vents, and cooling tower heat exchange systems are performance-based and emphasize 
monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, and enforcement, rather than establishing individual unit 
emission rates.  Site-wide HRVOC emission caps were established and adopted in the SIP for 
sites subject to the HRVOC rules for flares, process vents, and cooling tower heat exchange 
systems.  The December 2002 SIP revision exchanging the two strategies for the one strategy met 
the FCAA, §110(l) requirement, which allows a revision of the SIP where that revision would not 
interfere with reasonable further progress toward attainment of the NAAQS. 
 
1.2.1.4  December 2004 
As previously noted in Section 1.2.1.1 of this chapter, in December 2000, the TCEQ committed 
to perform an MCR to ensure attainment of the one-hour ozone standard.  The MCR process 
provided the opportunity to update emissions inventory data, use current modeling tools, and 
enhance the photochemical grid modeling.  The data gathered from the TexAQS 2000 was used 
to improve the photochemical modeling of the HGB area.  These technical improvements 
provided a more comprehensive understanding of the ozone challenge in the HGB area that is 
necessary to develop an attainment plan.  In early 2003, as the TCEQ was preparing to move 
forward with the MCR, the EPA announced its plans to begin implementation of the 1997 eight-
hour ozone standard.  The EPA published its proposed implementation rule for the 1997 eight-
hour ozone standard in the June 2, 2003, issue of the Federal Register (68 FR 32802).  In the 
same timeframe, the EPA formalized its intentions to designate areas for the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone standard by April 15, 2004, requiring states to reassess their efforts and control strategies 
to address this new standard in a revised plan to be submitted to the EPA by June 2007.  
Recognizing that existing one-hour nonattainment areas would soon be subject to the 1997 eight-
hour ozone standard and in an effort to efficiently manage the state’s limited resources, the TCEQ 
developed an approach that addressed the outstanding obligations under the one-hour ozone 
standard while beginning to analyze eight-hour ozone issues. 
 
The TCEQ’s one-hour ozone SIP revision commitments that were addressed in the December 
2004 HGB Ozone Nonattainment Area SIP revision include:  completion of a one-hour ozone 
MCR; performance of modeling; adoption of measures sufficient to fill the shortfall of NOX 
reductions; adoption of measures sufficient to demonstrate attainment; revision of the MVEB 
using the EPA’s MOBILE6 model; and revision of the VMEP measures. 
 
The December 2004 revision reflected a shift from primarily reducing industrial emissions of 
NOX to reducing both industrial emissions of NOX and industrial point source HRVOC.  This 
revision included measures to ensure compliance with the specific strategies to control HRVOC 
emissions and replaced the site-wide caps adopted in the SIP with the HRVOC Emissions Cap 
and Trade (HECT) program in 30 TAC Chapter 101.  The HECT program is an annual cap and 
trade program developed to provide sources compliance flexibility in meeting the control 
requirements for flares, process vents, and cooling tower heat exchange systems in 30 TAC 
Chapter 115.  Sites subject to the program are required to possess an HRVOC allowance for each 
ton of HRVOC emissions.  Sites have the option to trade excess HRVOC allowances on the open 
market.  The December 2004 SIP revision also reflected the repeal of the motor vehicle idling 
rules and modified certain recordkeeping requirements of the general VOC fugitive emission 
rules to make them apply only to sources of HRVOC fugitive emissions. 
 
1.2.1.5  EPA Approval of the One-Hour Ozone Attainment Demonstration 
The EPA published its approval of the HGB nonattainment area one-hour ozone attainment 
demonstration in the September 6, 2006, issue of the Federal Register (71 FR 52656).  Also in a 
separate action, the EPA concurrently approved rules for the control of HRVOC, the HECT 
program, the MECT program, and the emissions reduction credit banking and trading program, 

 
1-4
and conditionally approved rules for the discrete emissions reduction credit banking and trading 
program. 
 
1.2.2  Eight-Hour Ozone NAAQS History 
In 1997, the EPA revised the health-based NAAQS for ozone, setting it at 0.08 ppm averaged 
over an eight-hour time frame.  The final 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS was published in the 
Federal Register on July 18, 1997 (62 FR 38856), and became effective on September 16, 1997.  
On April 30, 2004, the EPA finalized its attainment/nonattainment designations and promulgated 
the first phase of its implementation rule for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard (69 FR 23951).  
These actions became effective on June 15, 2004.  The EPA classified the HGB area as a 
moderate nonattainment area for the standard under the 1990 FCAA (42 United States Code,  
§§ 7401 et seq.).  The TCEQ was required to submit a SIP revision for the 1997 eight-hour ozone 
NAAQS to the EPA by June 15, 2007, and demonstrate attainment of the standard by June 15, 
2010.  In the November 29, 2005, issue of the Federal Register (70 FR 71612) the EPA published 
its second phase of the implementation rule for the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS, which 
addressed the control obligations that apply to areas designated nonattainment for the standard. 
 
The commission adopted the 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area SIP revision and the 
reasonable further progress SIP revision for the HGB area on May 23, 2007.  These SIP revisions 
were the first step in addressing the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard in the HGB area.  The TCEQ 
demonstrated reasonable further progress toward attaining the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard 
and committed to attaining the 1997 standard as expeditiously as practicable and developing an 
HGB 1997 eight-hour ozone attainment demonstration SIP revision. 
 
On June 15, 2007, these two revisions to the Texas SIP and a letter from the governor of Texas 
requesting that the HGB ozone nonattainment area be reclassified from a moderate nonattainment 
area to a severe nonattainment area were submitted to the EPA.  The EPA granted the governor’s 
request to voluntarily reclassify the HGB ozone nonattainment area from a moderate to a severe 
nonattainment area for the 1997 ozone NAAQS in the October 1, 2008, issue of the Federal 
Register (73 FR 56983).  The EPA set April 15, 2010, as the date for the state to submit a revised 
SIP addressing the severe ozone nonattainment area requirements of the FCAA.  The area’s new 
attainment date for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard is as expeditiously as practicable but no 
later than June 15, 2019. 
 
1.2.2.1  May 23, 2007 
On May 23, 2007, the commission adopted the HGB 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Nonattainment 
Area SIP revision.  This SIP revision contained the reasonably available control technology 
(RACT) analysis, additional VMEP commitments, and the Texas 2002 Periodic Emissions 
Inventory for the HGB Ozone Nonattainment Area.  This SIP revision also included rule 
revisions to 30 TAC Chapter 114 to add marine diesel fuels to the definition of diesel fuels that 
are subject to the Texas Low Emission Diesel Rule and to 30 TAC Chapter 115 to control 
underestimated, unreported, or underreported VOC emissions from tank landings, flash 
emissions, and degassing of storage tanks, transport vessels, and marine vessels with liquid heels.  
In an associated rulemaking project, 30 TAC Chapter 117 was reformatted and the 10 nanogram 
per Joule (ng/J) heat input NOX standard for residential water heaters was repealed in accordance 
with House Bill (HB) 965, 79th Texas Legislature, 2005.  The emission standard of 40 ng/J NOX 
was retained. 
 
This revision also described ongoing efforts to develop the eight-hour ozone attainment 
demonstration including a new modeling episode using days from 2005 and 2006, the continued 
implementation of increasingly lower federal on-road and non-road engine standards, and further 
research and consideration of additional control strategies. 
 
The HGB 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Nonattainment Area Reasonable Further Progress SIP 
revision, also adopted by the commission on May 23, 2007, demonstrates that the reasonable 
further progress 15 percent reduction requirement would be met for the analysis period of 2002 - 

2008.  Demonstration of reasonable further progress is based on the guidelines in the second 
phase of the EPA’s 1997 eight-hour ozone implementation rule.  On April 22, 2009, the EPA 
published a direct final approval of the reasonable further progress SIP revision, its associated 
MVEBs, and the 2002 base year emissions inventory (74 FR 18298). 
 
1.2.3  Existing Ozone Control Strategies   
Existing ozone control strategies and VMEP measures, discussed in Chapter 4, Control Strategies 
and Required Elements, Section 4.2, Existing Control Measures show key control strategies for 
complying with both the one-hour and eight-hour ozone NAAQS in the HGB nonattainment area.  
Existing control strategies targeted to the one-hour standard are expected to continue to reduce 
emissions of ozone precursors in the HGB area and positively impact progress toward attainment 
of the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.  The one-hour and 1997 eight-hour ozone design values 
for the HGB area from 1991 to 2008 are illustrated in Figure 1-1:  One-Hour and 1997 Eight-
Hour Ozone Design Values and HGB Area Population.  Both design values have decreased over 
the past 18 years.  The 2008 one-hour ozone design value was 147 ppb, representing a 33 percent 
decrease from the value for 1991 (220 ppb).  The 2008 eight-hour ozone design value was 91 
ppb, a 24 percent decrease from the 1991 value of 119 ppb.  These decreases occurred despite a 
47 percent increase in area population, as shown in the Figure 1-1:  One-Hour and 1997 Eight-
Hour Ozone Design Values and HGB Area Population.

1.2.4  2010 Proposed Revision 
The EPA reclassification of the HGB area as a severe nonattainment area for the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone NAAQS became effective on October 31, 2008.  Severe nonattainment areas are required 
to attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard as expeditiously as practicable but no later than June 
15, 2019.  The state must submit a SIP revision addressing the severe ozone nonattainment area 
requirements of the FCAA by April 15, 2010.

This SIP revision demonstrates attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS using a 
photochemical modeling analysis and a weight of evidence corroborative analysis.  This submittal 
contains proposed new state and local control measures.  The Houston-Galveston Area Council 
(H-GAC), as the regional metropolitan transportation planning agency for the HGB area, has 
identified VMEP measures and transportation control measures for NOX emission reductions. 
 
Photochemical modeling analysis demonstrates that a 25 percent reduction of the HECT cap on 
the total Harris County HRVOC allocation would contribute to attainment of the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone NAAQS by reducing the future 2018 ozone design values at all HGB monitors.  
Accordingly, this SIP revision contains a proposed 25 percent reduction in the total HECT 
allowance cap and revision of the HRVOC allocation methodology.  The HECT program will 
continue to be applicable only in Harris County. 
 
This SIP revision also contains the RACT analysis, the reasonably available control measures 
(RACM) analysis, updates to existing control measures, contingency measures, and the MVEB.  
The plan also describes ongoing technological research and development as well as future 
initiatives. 
 
The HGB Reasonable Further Progress SIP Revision for the1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Standard 
(Project No. 2009-018-SIP-NR), which demonstrates the FCAA requirement of interim 
reductions of ozone precursors through the 2019 attainment date, is being proposed in a 
concurrent action. 
 
Table 1-1:  Proposed Rule Revisions contains the project number, title, and description of 
proposed rule revisions to 30 TAC Chapters 101 and 115 that are associated with this SIP 
revision.  Additional information regarding these rule revisions is included in Chapter 4:  Control 
Strategies and Required Elements.

VOC Control Technique 
Guidelines (CTG) Update 
The proposed revisions to 30 TAC Chapter 115, 
Subchapter E, Division 4 would limit the VOC 
content of solvents used by offset lithographic 
printing facilities located in the HGB area and 
would implement the CTG recommendations to 
reduce the VOC content of the fountain solutions 
and cleaning materials used by such facilities.  
Additionally, the proposed revisions would expand 
the current rule applicability to include smaller 
sources not currently subject to the rule.  The 
proposed revisions are to satisfy RACT for the 
2006 federal CTG document for offset lithographic 
and letterpress printing operations. 
 
 
The commission is soliciting comments on whether it is appropriate to perform a 1997 eight-hour 
ozone MCR analysis for the HGB area, and, if so, what elements should be contained in the 
analysis.  The commission is also seeking input on the appropriate date to submit the MCR. 
 
1.3  HEALTH EFFECTS 
In 1997, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone from a one-hour to an eight-hour standard.  To 
support the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard, the EPA provided information indicating that health 
effects can occur at levels lower than the previous standard and at exposure times longer than one 
hour.  Exposure to ambient ozone can cause asthma in some people.  Repeated exposures to 
ozone can make people more susceptible to respiratory infection and lung inflammation and can 
aggravate preexisting respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis and emphysema. 
Children are at a relatively higher risk from exposure to ozone when compared to adults, since 
they breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults and because children’s respiratory 
systems are still developing.  Children also spend a considerable amount of time outdoors during 
summer and during the start of the school year (August - October) when high ozone levels are 
typically recorded.  Adults most at risk to ozone exposure are people working or exercising 
outdoors and individuals with preexisting respiratory diseases. 
1.4  STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND PUBLIC HEARINGS

meetings to discuss concepts of potential control strategies for the eight-county HGB ozone 
nonattainment area and to hear the public’s ideas on potential rulemaking concepts and provide 
the public an overview of the development of the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP Revision  
for the 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Standard.  The meetings were held on March 25 and 26, 2008, at 
the Houston City Hall Annex.  In these meetings, the TCEQ presented attendees with an update 
on the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP Revision timeline, an update on modeling efforts, and 
a draft list of initial potential control strategy concepts for stationary, area, and mobile sources.  
The TCEQ held an additional stakeholder meeting to discuss the initial 2018 HGB modeling 
results, provide an update on the development status of the HGB SIP revision, and provide an 
update from H-GAC regarding potential local mobile source control strategies.  This meeting was 
held on November 3, 2008, at H-GAC.  Additional information on the HGB Eight-Hour Ozone 
SIP Stakeholder Group is available at: 
http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/sip/hgb_stakeholder.html. 
 
A meeting was held on May 15, 2008, at H-GAC to discuss the development of the HGB 
Attainment Demonstration SIP Revision for the 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Standard and potential 
local control measures with local governments.  Letters inviting participation were sent to the 15 
mayors of cities in the HGB area with populations greater than 20,000, the eight county judges, 
and the four Harris County commissioners.  Notification was also sent to state representatives and 
senators representing the districts in the HGB area.  Another meeting was held on July 22, 2008, 
at H-GAC to provide local governments information on the SIP revision, as well as discuss the 
process to identify potential measures that can be implemented at the local level.  For this 
meeting, 109 letters inviting participation were sent to mayors of cities in the HGB area with 
populations of 20,000 or less.

CHAPTER 2:  ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS INVENTORY (EI) DESCRIPTION 
 
2.1  INTRODUCTION 
The Air Emissions Reporting Requirements (AERR), published in the December 17, 2008, issue 
of the Federal Register (73 FR 76539), instruct states to submit EIs containing information 
regarding the emissions of criteria pollutants and criteria pollutant precursors (e.g., volatile 
organic compounds (VOC)).  EIs are critical for the efforts of state, local, and federal agencies to 
attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).   
 
EIs provide data for a variety of air quality planning tasks, including establishing baseline 
emission levels, calculating emission reduction targets, control strategy development for 
achieving required emission reductions, emission inputs into air quality simulation models, and 
tracking actual emission reductions against the established emissions growth and control budgets. 
 
This chapter discusses general EI development for each of the AERR source categories.  Chapter 
3, Photochemical Modeling details specific emissions inventories and emissions inputs developed 
for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) ozone photochemical modeling.    
 
2.1.1  EI Improvement 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) EI reflects years of continuous 
emissions data improvement, including extensive point and area source inventory reconciliation 
with ambient emissions monitoring data.  Since the Texas Air Quality Study 2000 (TexAQS 
2000), when ambient VOC concentrations were measured to be greater than EI estimates, EI 
improvements have targeted more accurate speciation and reporting of industrial VOC emissions.  
The following have significantly improved the HGB point source or area source inventory. 
 
• 
Implementation of the 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 115 highly reactive 
volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) monitoring rules improved the HGB point source 
VOC inventory with measurements required of vents, cooling towers, and the streams to 
flares in HRVOC service. 
 
• 
The Houston Advanced Research Center project H51C  
(http://www.harc.edu/Projects/AirQuality/Projects/Projects/H051C) identified thousands 
of tons of VOC flash emissions from upstream oil and gas operations in the HGB area 
that the TCEQ has added to the area source inventory. 
 
• 
A special landing loss EI was conducted that required the reporting of landing loss 
emissions from floating roof tanks.  This special inventory also required regulated entities 
in the HGB area to revise their emissions inventories back to 2002, resulting in a 
reporting increase of approximately 7,000 to 8,000 tons of VOC per year (2002-2004).  
The episodic nature of these emissions is represented in the 2005 and 2006 ozone 
modeling based on site-specific activity data. 
 
• 
A month-long hourly EI of approximately 1,200 emissions sources at 125 industrial sites 
was conducted during the TexAQS II intensive period.  These hourly data are integrated 
into the 2006 modeling episode, providing highly resolved hourly VOC and nitrogen 
oxides (NOX) emissions data for sources located in the HGB area.  Monitored emissions 
data were collected for the majority of the VOC hourly emissions and all of the NOX 
emissions rates.  Because these sources are not included in the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Acid Rain database, these hourly data present 
an opportunity to model a unique and extensive set of monitoring data that characterizes 
the time-dependent nature of industrial ozone precursor emissions.  
 

 
2-2 
• 
The TCEQ Emissions Inventory Guidelines (RG-360A), a comprehensive guidance 
document which explains all aspects of the point source EI process is updated and 
published annually.  The latest version of this document is available on the TCEQ’s Point 
Source Emissions Inventory Web site at:   
(http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/industei/psei/psei.html).  Currently, six 
technical supplements provide detailed guidance on determining emissions from 
potentially underreported VOC emissions sources such as cooling towers, flares, and 
storage tanks. 
 
 
2.2  POINT SOURCES 
Stationary point source emissions data are collected annually from sites that meet the reporting 
requirements of 30 TAC § 101.10.  These sites include, but are not limited to, refineries, chemical 
plants, bulk terminals, and utilities.  To collect the data, the TCEQ mails EI questionnaires (EIQ) 
to all sites identified as meeting the reporting requirements.  Companies are required to report 
emissions data and to provide sample calculations used to determine the emissions.  Information 
characterizing the process equipment, the abatement units, and the emission points is also 
required.  All data submitted in the EIQ are reviewed for quality assurance purposes and then 
stored in the State of Texas Air Reporting System (STARS) database.  At the end of the annual 
reporting cycle, point source emissions data are reported each year to the EPA for inclusion in the 
National Emissions Inventory (NEI). 
 
2.3  AREA SOURCES 
Area sources are stationary emission sources that are not included in the point source EI.  Similar 
area sources such as plants, facilities, equipment, and/or processes are grouped into area source 
categories including, but not limited to, vehicle refueling, architectural coatings, auto refinishing, 
dry cleaning, municipal solid waste landfills, bakeries, residential fuel combustion, structural 
fires, wildfires, and open burning.   
 
Area source categories can further be characterized by the mechanism in which their emissions 
are released into the atmosphere:  hydrocarbon evaporative emissions or fuel combustion 
emissions.  Hydrocarbon evaporative emission sources include, but are not limited to, printing 
operations, industrial coatings, degreasing solvents, house painting, gasoline service station 
underground tank filling, and vehicle refueling operations.  Fuel combustion emission sources 
include, but are not limited to, stationary source fossil fuel combustion at residences and 
businesses, outdoor burning, structural fires, and wildfires.  Since area source categories represent 
individual emission sources that are small and numerous and that have not been inventoried as 
specific point or mobile sources, the EI for an area source category is developed for a specified 
geographic area by estimating the emissions collectively.   
 
The emissions from these area source categories, with some exceptions, may be calculated by 
applying an EPA-established emission factor (emissions per unit of activity) to the appropriate 
activity or activity surrogate responsible for generating emissions.  Population is the most 
commonly used activity surrogate; examples of other activity data are the amount of gasoline sold 
in an area, employment by industry type, and acres of crop land.  Activity data for an area source 
category is obtained via surveys, research, and/or investigations.  Air emissions data from the 
different area source categories are collected, reviewed for quality assurance purposes, stored in 
the Texas Air Emissions Repository database system, and compiled to develop the statewide area 

 
2-3 
 source EI.  This area source Periodic Emissions Inventory (PEI) is reported every third year 
(triennially) to the EPA for inclusion in the NEI; the TCEQ submitted the most recent PEI for 
calendar year 2005. 
 
2.4  NON-ROAD MOBILE SOURCES 
Non-road mobile sources include vehicles, engines, and equipment used for construction, 
agriculture, transportation, recreation, and many other purposes. Non-road vehicles are also 
referred to as off-road or off-highway vehicles that do not normally operate on roads or highways. 
This broad category is comprised of a diverse collection of machines, many of which are powered 
by diesel engines. Examples of non-road mobile sources include, but are not limited to: 
agricultural equipment, commercial and industrial equipment, construction and mining 
equipment, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels. 
 
A Texas specific version of the EPA’s NONROAD 2005 model, called the Texas NONROAD 
(TexN) model, is used in calculating emissions from all non-road mobile equipment and 
recreational vehicles except aircraft, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels.  Emissions for 
these three source categories are estimated using other EPA-approved methods and guidance 
documents.  Airport emissions are calculated using the Federal Aviation Administration’s 
Emissions and Dispersion Modeling System, version 5.1.  Locomotive emission estimates for 
Texas are based on specific fuel usage data derived from railway segment level gross ton mileage 
activity (line haul locomotives) and hours of operation (yard locomotives) provided directly by 
the Class I railroad companies operating in Texas.  Data captured from the Automatic 
Identification System program is applied to the latest known emission factors to quantify 
emissions from commercial marine vessels. 
 
2.5  ON-ROAD MOBILE SOURCES  
On-road mobile sources consist of automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, and other motor vehicles 
traveling on public roadways.  Combustion-related emissions are estimated for vehicle engine 
exhaust, and evaporative hydrocarbon emissions are estimated for the fuel tank and other 
evaporative leak sources on the vehicle.  The information necessary to estimate on-road mobile 
emissions is emission factors for each vehicle type, the estimated level of vehicle activity, and 
estimated roadway speed.  
 
Emission factors were developed using the newest version of the EPA's mobile emissions factor 
model, MOBILE6.2.03.  Various inputs are provided to the model to simulate the vehicle fleet in 
each nonattainment area.  Inputs used to develop localized emission factors include vehicle 
speeds, vehicle age distributions, local meteorological conditions, type of inspection and 
maintenance program in place, and local fuel properties.  Emission factors are developed for all 
28 MOBILE6.2.03 vehicle types. 
 
The level of vehicle travel activity is developed using localized travel demand models (TDM) run 
by the Texas Transportation Institute, Texas Department of Transportation, or regional 
metropolitan planning organizations.  The TDM have been validated using a large number of 
ground counts from traffic counters placed in various locations throughout Texas.  Estimates of 
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are often calibrated to outputs from the federal Highway 
Performance Monitor System, which is a model validated using a different set of traffic counters.  
VMT is  allocated to the appropriate vehicle types using regional specific VMT mixes developed 
using ground counts and vehicle registration data. 
 

 
2-4 
Roadway speeds are needed to select the appropriate MOBILE6.2.03 emission factors. Roadway 
speeds are calculated by a post-processor to the TDM.  The speed models use roadway capacity 
information, the estimated volumes from the TDM, and speed correlations based upon volume to 
capacity ratios to estimate roadway speeds. 
 
To develop on-road mobile emissions estimates, the speed specific MOBILE6.2.03 emission 
factors are multiplied by the VMT for each roadway link in the TDM network.

3.1  INTRODUCTION 
This chapter describes modeling conducted in support of the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) 
Attainment Demonstration State Implementation Plan (SIP) Revision for the 1997 Eight-Hour 
Ozone Standard.  The HGB nonattainment area consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, 
Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties.  The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act 
(FCAA) amendments require that attainment demonstrations be based on photochemical grid 
modeling or any other analytical methods determined by the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) to be at least as effective.  The EPA’s April 2007 “Guidance on the Use 
of Models and Other Analyses for Demonstrating Attainment of Air Quality Goals for Ozone, 
PM2.5, and Regional Haze” (EPA, 2007; hereafter referred to as “modeling guidance”) 
recommends new procedures for determining whether a control strategy package will lead t
a
 
The current modeling guidance recommends several qualitative methods for preparing attainment 
demonstrations that acknowledge the limitations and uncertainties of photochemical models when 
used to project ozone concentrations into future years.  First, the guidance recommends using 
model results in a relative sense and applying the model response to the observed ozone data.  
Second, the guidance recommends using available air quality, meteorology, and emissions data to 
develop a conceptual model for eight-hour ozone formation and to use that analysis in episode 
selection.  Third, the guidance recommends using other analyses (Weight of Evidence) to 
supplement and co
s
 
The 1990 FCAA amendments established five classifications for ozone nonattainment areas 
based on the magnitude of the monitored one-hour ozone design values and established dates by 
which each classified area should attain the NAAQS.  Based on the monitored one-hour ozone 
design value at that time, the HGB Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (Brazoria, 
Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller counties) was 
classified severe-17, with an attainment date of November 15, 2007.  Dating back to 1990, there 
have been six SIP revisions with supporting photochemical modeling addressing the one-hour 
ozone NAAQS.  The most recent one-hour ozone HGB SIP r

With the change of the ozone NAAQS from a one-hour standard to an eight-hour standard, in 
April 2004, the EPA classified the HGB area as a moderate ozone nonattainment area with an 
attainment date of June 15, 2010.  Ozone SIP revisions addressing the eight-hour ozone standard 
were due June 15, 2007.  Ozone modeling and other analyses conducted by the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for the SIP revision resulted in a determination 
that it was not p

Therefore, the ozone SIP revision submitted to EPA on June 15, 2007, included a request to 
reclassify the area as severe nonattainment for the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS, with an 
attainment date of June 15, 2019.  Because the attainment date is early in the 2019 ozone season, 
the EPA has prescribed that the modeling attainment test be app

area will attain the 0.08 parts per million (ppm) 1997 eight-hour ozone standard by June 15, 2019.

3.1.1  Overview of the Ozone Photochemical Modeling Process 
The modeling system is composed of a meteorological model, several emissions processing 
models, and a photochemical air quality model. 
p
 
Ozone is a secondary pollutant; it is not generally emitted directly into the atmosphere.  Ozone is 
created in the atmosphere by a complex set of chemical reactions between sunlight and several 
primary (directly emitted) pollutants.  The reactions are photochemical and require ultraviolet 
energy from sunlight.  The primary pollutants fall into two groups, nitrogen oxides (NOX) and 
volatile organic compounds (VOC).  In addition, carbon monoxide (CO) is also an ozone 
precursor, but much less effective than either NOX or VOC in forming ozone.  As a result of these 
multiple factors, higher concentrations of ozone are most common during the summer 
co
  
Ozone chemistry is complex, involving hundreds of chemical compounds and chemical reactions.  
As a result, ozone cannot be evaluated using simple dilution and dispersion algorithms.  Due to 
this chemical complexity, the modeling guidance strongly recommends using photochemical 
computer models to simulate ozone formation and evaluate the effectiveness of future control 
strategies.  Computer simulations are the

3.1.2  Ozone Modeling 
Ozone modeling involves two major phases, the base case modeling phase and the future year 
modeling phase (with substeps in each phase).  The purpose of the base case modeling phase is to 
evaluate the model’s ability to adequately replicate measured ozone and ozone precursor 
concentrations during recent periods with high ozone concentrations (base case episodes).  The 
purpose of the future year modeling phase is to predict attainment year ozone design values, as 
well as evaluate the effectiveness of controls in reaching attainment.  The TCEQ developed a 
modeling protocol (plan) describing the process to be
a
 
3.1.3  Base Case Modeling 
Base case modeling involves several steps.  First, recent episodes are analyzed to determine what 
factors were associated with ozone formation in the area and whether those factors were 
consistent with the conceptual model.  In consultation with the Southeast Texas Photochemical 
Modeling Technical Committee (SETPMTC), which serves in an advisory role for the technical 
aspects of applying
e
 
The next step is to generate and quality-assure the emissions and meteorological data for the 
selected episodes.  Then the meteorological and emissions (NOX, VOC and CO) data are input to 
the photochemical model and the ozone photochemistry is simulated, resulting in predicted ozone 
and ozone precursor concentrations.  Base case modeling results are evaluated by comparing 
them to the observed measurements of ozone and ozone precursors.  Typically this step is an 
iterative process incorporating feedback from successive evaluations to ensure that the model is 
adequately replicating observations throughout the modeling episode.  The adequacy of the model 
in replicating observations is assessed based on compliance with statistical and graphical 
measures as recommended in the modeling guidance.  In addition to the recommended analyses, 
the TCEQ used the TexAQS II observations to extend its model performance evaluation to areas 
and chemical species not normally monitored.  This extended analysis included use of monitoring 
data collected on aircraft and ship-based platforms.  Satisfactory performance of the base case

3.1.4  Future Year Modeling 
Future year modeling involves several steps.  The procedure for predicting future year ozone 
design values (attainment test) involves determining the ratio of the future year to the baseline 
year modeled ozone concentrations.  This ratio is called the relative response factor (RRF).  
Whereas the emissions data for the base case modeling are episode-specific, the emissions data 
for the baseline year are based on typical ozone season emissions.  Similarly, the emissions data 
for the future year are developed applying growth and control factors to the baseline year 
emissions.  The growth an

Both the baseline and future years are modeled using their respective ozone season emissions and 
the base case episode meteorological data as inputs.  The same meteorological data are used for 
modeling both the baseline and future yea
c
concentrations to the change in emissions.  
 
The future year ozone design value is calculated by multiplying the RRF by a baseline year ozone 
design value (DVB).  The DVB is the average of the regulatory design values for the three 
consecutive years containing the baseline year (see Figure 3-1:  Baseline Design Value 
Calculation Illustration).  When the calculated future year ozone design value is less than or 
equal to 0.08 ppm (84 parts per billion (ppb)), this signifies modeled attainment.  When the 
calculated future year ozone de

somewhat bi-modal with a notable high frequency in the late May to early June period and the 
more prominent period of high frequency occurring from late August through September.

The modeling guidance sets forth the primary
ozone attainment demonstration modeling: 
 
• 
Select a mix of episodes reflecting a variety of meteorological conditions that fre
correspond with observed eight-hour daily maximum ozone concentrations greater than 
84 ppb at different monitoring sites; 
eight-hour ozone design value at each ke
• 
Select periods for which extensive air quality/meteorological databases exist; and 
• 
Model a sufficient number of days so that the modeled attainment test can be applied at 
all of the ozone monito
 
3.2.2  HGB Ozone Episode Selection Process  
An episode selection analysis was performed to identify time periods with eight-hour ozone 
exceedance days that complied with the primary selection criteria.  The analysis identified several 
episodes from 2005 and 2006.

Selecting a large number of days also increases the likelihood that the distribution of days 
associated with various ozone-conducive wind patterns will be consistent with the conceptual

Hourly average resultant winds are plotted in the figure.  The x-axis represents the east-west 
component of the wind while the y-axis represents the north-south component.  Each point on the 
loop represents an hour of the day.  The red data point corresponds to midnight and the aqua point 
corresponds to noon.  Wind vectors have two attributes, wind speed and direction, and these 
components were averaged across monitors for each hour of the day and then plotted.  Each point 
represents the tail of that hour’s averaged resultant wind vector, and although not plotted, all the 
resultant wind vectors terminate at the origin.  In other words, the direction from the point to the 
origin represents the direct

the data across monitors.

Even though there are 52 exceedance days in the 2005 and 2006 episodes, only a few of the 
regulatory monitors measured daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentrations of greater than 84 
ppb on 10 or more days.  This reflects the complexity of ozone formation and distribution in the 
HGB area.  For example, the Houston Texas Avenue (HTCA, CAMS 411) and TCEQ Houston 
Regional Office (HROC, CAMS 81) monitors are in fairly close proximity to one another, but the 
Houston Texas Avenue (CAMS 411) monitor measured a daily maximum eight-hour ozone 
concentration of greater than 84 ppb on only one day, while the TCEQ Houston Regional Office 
(CAMS 81) monitor measured it on nine days.  The attainment test considers the modeled daily 
maximum eight-hour ozone concentration from an array of grid cells around the cell containing a 
monitor.  By considering an array of grid cells around the monitor, rather than the single grid cell 
where the monitor is located, the likelihood of modeled concentrations exceeding 84 ppb is 
increased.  This increases the number of days used in the attainment test (i.e., the RRF calculation). 
 
There were a few other ozone episodes during the 2005 and 2006 ozone season that were not 
developed due to unusual meteorological conditions.  For example, exceedance days that occurred 
in late August and September of 2005 may have been influenced by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

3.3  METEOROLOGICAL MODEL 
The TCEQ is using the Fifth Generation Meteorological Model (MM5, version 3.7.3) developed 
jointly by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Pennsylvania State 
University (Grell et al., 1994).  This model, supported by a broad user community including the 
Air Force Weather Agency, national laboratories, and academia, is being used extensively for 
regulatory air quality modeling analyses throughout the United States. 
 
3.3.1  Modeling Domains 
MM5 was configured with three two-way nested outer grids (108 kilometer (km), 36 km, and 12 
km horizontal resolution) to cover the United States and regional areas of interest.  A one-way 
nested 4 km fine grid covering the eastern half of Texas was used to focus on metropolitan areas 
with air quality degradation, as shown in Figure 3-7:  MM5 Modeling Domains.  The extent of each 
of the MM5 modeling domains was selected to accommodate the embedding of the commensurate 
air quality modeling domains (see Section 3.5:  PHOTOCHEMICAL MODELING). 
 
Vertically, MM5 is structured with 43 layers from the surface to approximately 20 km.  Twenty 
layers are within the first 3,000 meters in order to resolve boundary layer phenomena.  The same 
MM5 vertical layering structure is used for all of the domains.

3.3.2  Model (MM5) Configuration 
Based on past TCEQ modeling efforts, the EPA’s modeling guidance (EPA, 2007), contractor 
experience, and other demonstrations including sensitivity tests and model performance evaluation, 
the MM5 was configured with parameterizations and improved input data to optimize the 
performance of the wind field (i.e., wind speed and direction).  Wind speed and direction are the

To improve the MM5 simulation of the meteorological parameters, in particular the wind field, the 
land use characteristics and sea surface temperatures on all domains were updated with high 
resolution satellite measurements.  In addition, observed parameters are assimilated in MM5 during 
the model run through a process called Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (FDDA), or nudging 
(Stauffer and Seaman, 1990; Stauffer et al., 1991; Stauffer and Seaman, 1994).  The outer domains 
(108 km, 36 km, and 12 km) were nudged to the National Center for Environmental Prediction 
(NCEP) North American Model (NAM) gridded output for winds, temperature, and water vapor.  
The fine scale 4 km domain was observationally nudged using quality-assured upper air wind 
profiler data.  MM5 default nudging strength parameters were used for both the NAM and profile

A detailed performance evaluation for each of the 2005 and 2006 meteorological modeling 
episodes is included in Appendix A:  Meteorological Modeling for the HGB Attainment 
Demonstration SIP.  In addition, all performance evaluation products are available on the TCEQ 
file transfer protocol (FTP) site (TCEQ, 2009). 
 
As mentioned, the wind speed and direction are deemed to be the most important meteorological 
parameters input to the air quality model.  The MM5 modeled wind field was evaluated by 
comparing the hourly modeled and measured wind speed and direction for all monitors in the HGB 
area.  Figure 3-8:  Meteorological Modeling Performance exhibits the percent of hours for which 
the average absolute difference between the modeled and measured wind speed and direction, for 
all monitors in the HGB area, was within the specified accuracy benchmarks (e.g., wind speed less 
than or equal to two meters per second: WSPD < 2 m/s).

3.4  MODELING EMISSIONS 
For the stationary emission source types, which consist of point and area sources, routine emission 
inventories provided the major inputs for the emissions modeling processing.  Emissions from 
mobile and biogenic sources were derived from relevant emission models.  Specifically, link-based 
on-road mobile source emissions were derived from a travel demand model coupled with the EPA 
MOBILE6.2 emission factor model, and non-road mobile source emissions were derived from the 
EPA’s National Mobile Inventory Model (NMIM), or the Texas NONROAD (TexN) mobile 
source models.  The on- and non-road emissions were processed to air quality model-ready using 
version three of the Emissions Processing System (EPS3; Environ, 2007).  Biogenic emissions 
were derived from the Global Biosphere Emissions and Interactions System (GloBEIS) model, 
which outputs air quality model-ready emissions. 
 
Appendix B:  Emissions Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP provides details on 
the development and processing of the emissions using the various EPS3 modules.  The modules, 
listed in Table 3-6:  EPS3 Emissions Processing Modules are used to create the chemically 
speciated, temporally (hourly) allocated, and spatially distributed emission files needed for the air 
quality model.

The following sections give a brief description of the development of each type of emissions. 
 
3.4.1  Biogenic Emissions 
The TCEQ used Version 3.1 of the GloBEIS model to develop the biogenic emissions.  It 
incorporates detailed locality-specific land-use data to generate the mix and density of vegetative 
species.  In addition, solar radiation data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 
(GOES) imagery, which is used to generate the photosynthetically active solar radiation (PAR), can 
be input to the GloBEIS model.  Further, the GloBEIS model can accept hourly temperature data 
generated from weather station data. 
 
Biogenic Emissions Landuse Data,Version 3 (BELD3; Kinnee et al., 1997), a vegetation database 
for the entire North American continent prepared specifically for creating biogenic emissions 
inventories, was used for the 36 km domain and the portion of the 12 km domain outside Texas.  
For the land-use data in the 12 km domain within Texas, the TCEQ used the Texas vegetation 
database (Wiedinmyer et al., 2001), which was derived from Texas Parks and Wildlife vegetation 
data and agricultural statistics from the National Agricultural Statistics Survey, and field surveys 
carried out in 1999.  Within the 4 km nested domain, a new land-cover database from the 
University of Texas Center for Space Research (UT-CSR) was used (Feldman et al., 2007).  This 
database was developed from classification of recent Landsat 7 data, Shuttle Radar Topography 
Mission and National Elevation datasets to identify wetlands, and United States Department of 
Agriculture, Common Land Unit CLU data to identify agricultural land. 
 
The episode-specific PAR data input to GloBEIS were obtained from the website operated by the 
Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project 
(GCIP) 
and 
GEWEX 
Americas 
Prediction 
Project 
(GAPP) 
located 
at 
http://metosrv2.umd.edu/~srb/gcip/cgi-bin/historic.cgi?auth=no.  The episode-specific temperature 
data were obtained from weather stations throughout the United States, including data from the 
National Weather Service, the EPA Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) air quality 
database, the National Buoy Data Center, the Texas A&M Crop Weather Program, the Louisiana 
Agricultural Information Service, and the Texas Coastal Oceanographic Observation Network.   
 
GloBEIS3.1 was run for each of the modeling episode days listed in Table 3-7: 2005 and 2006 
Episode Days for Emissions Modeling.  Figure 3-9:  An Example of Day-Specific Biogenic 
Emissions shows the typical magnitude and distribution of biogenic VOC and NOX emissions in 
the 4 km modeling domain.

Since biogenic emissions are associated with meteorological features, the same episode day-
specific emissions were used as input for the 2006 baseline and 2018 future air quality modeling. 
 
3.4.2  Base Cases 
3.4.2.1  Point Sources 
Point source modeling emissions were developed using data from regional inventories such as the 
Central Regional Air Planning Association/Regional Planning Organization (CENRAP/RPO) 
emissions database and EPA’s Acid Rain Database (ARD), state inventories including the State of 
Texas Air Reporting System (STARS), and local inventories including the TexAQS II Hourly 
Special Inventory (SI).  Data were processed with EPS3 to generate model-ready emissions, and 
similar procedures were used to develop each base case episode. 
 
Outside Texas 
Point source emissions data for the regions of the modeling domains outside Texas were obtained 
from a number of different sources.  Emissions from point sources in the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., oil 
and gas production platforms) were obtained from the 2005 Gulf-wide Emissions Inventory 
(GWEI) provided by the Minerals Management Services (MMS) as monthly totals.  The Canadian 
emissions were obtained from EPA modeling emission files developed for the 2001 Clean Air 
Interstate Rule (CAIR) base case analysis (EPA, 2005) and the Mexican emissions inventory data 
were obtained from Phase III of the Mexican National Emissions Inventory (NEI; 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/mexico.html).   
 
For all states beyond Texas, hourly NOX emissions for major electric generating units (EGUs) were 
obtained from the ARD for each episode day.  Emissions for non-ARD sources in states beyond 
Texas were obtained from the 2002 CENRAP/RPO emissions database, with the exception of 

 
3-18 
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  State-specific 2005 point source annual emissions for non-
ARD sources were provided by Arkansas and Oklahoma.  Louisiana provided their 2004 point 
source emissions, since the 2005 emissions were incomplete due to hurricane Katrina.  The EPA’s 
Economic Growth Analysis System Version 5.0 (EGAS5) was used to grow these emissions to 
2005 and 2006 as appropriate for the various episodes.  
 
Within Texas 
Hourly NOX emissions from EGUs within Texas were obtained from the ARD for each episode day.  
Emissions from non-ARD sources were obtained from the TCEQ 2005 and 2006 STARS emissions 
inventories.  The 2006 TexAQS II hourly special inventory (SI) collected August 15 through 
September 15, 2006, was used for the August/September 2006 episode (bc06aqs1).  In addition, 
agricultural and forest fire emissions for the 2005 and 2006 episodes were obtained from a TCEQ-
funded study (Environ, 2008b), which treated fires as point sources.  For the HGB area, 2005 and 
2006 event-specific tank landing loss emissions were obtained from an SI revision requested by the 
TCEQ.  Highly Reactive Volatile Organic Compounds (HRVOC) (ethylene (ETH), propylene, 
butenes and 1,3-butadiene) emissions were reconciled with ambient measurements by comparing 
concentrations observed at automated gas chromatographs (auto-GCs) in the area with 
concentrations expected at those locations based on the reported inventory. See Appendix B:  
Emissions Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP for more details.

3.4.2.2  On-Road Mobile Sources 
On-road mobile source modeling emissions were developed using the EPA’s NMIM, and Highway 
Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) data and travel demand modeling (TDM) output coupled 
with the EPA MOBILE6.2 emissions model.  The output from these emission modeling 
applications were processed through EPS3 to generate the air quality model-ready on-road mobile 
source emission files. 
 
Outside Texas 
For all of the states beyond Texas, the TCEQ used NMIM to generate average summer weekday 
mobile source emissions by county for 2005 and 2006.  Average summer Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday mobile source emissions were estimated using the weekday to Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday ratios developed for the on-road mobile source emissions within Texas. 
 
Within Texas 
For the Texas counties outside of HGB and Beaumont-Port Arthur (BPA) areas, on-road emissions 
were developed by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) using HPMS data for 2005 and 2006, 
and the EPA’s MOBILE6.2 on-road mobile source emissions model to generate average summer 
emissions for the four day types of weekday (Monday through Thursday average), Friday, Saturday, 
and Sunday.  
 
For the eight-county HGB and three-county BPA areas, link-based on-road emission were 
developed by TTI using the TDM output for 2005 and 2006, and the EPA MOBILE6.2 on-road 
mobile source emissions model to generate average summer and school season on-road emission 

 
3-20 
for the four day types.  For the 2005 and 2006 base case episodes, both the school and summer 
season day type emissions were used as appropriate.

3.4.2.3  Non- and Off-Road Mobile Sources 
Non/Off-road mobile source modeling emissions were developed using the EPA NMIM, the EPA 
NEI, TexN, and data from the TCEQ’s Texas Air Emissions Repository (TexAER).  The output 
from these emission modeling applications and databases were processed through EPS3 to generate 
the air quality model-ready non- and off-road mobile source emission files. 
 
Outside Texas 
For all the states beyond Texas, the TCEQ used the EPA’s NMIM.  NMIM generates average 
summer weekday non-road mobile source category emissions by county and was run for 2005 and 
2006.  For the off-road mobile source categories (aircraft, locomotive, and marine) in the non-
Texas states, the TCEQ used the EPA’s 2002 NEI with EGAS5 growth factors and national 
controls for locomotives and marine vessels to generate 2005 and 2006 average summer weekday 
off-road mobile source category emissions.  Summer weekend day emissions for the non- and off-
road mobile source categories were developed as part of the EPS3 processing using category 
specific weekly activity profiles. 
 
Within Texas 
The TCEQ used the TexN model to generate average summer weekday non-road mobile source 
category emissions by county for 2005 and 2006.  County-level off-road emissions for 2005 were 
obtained from the TCEQ’s 2005 TexAER, and the 2006 county-level off-road emissions were 
estimated by adjusting the 2005 TexAER emissions with the Texas-specific Regional Economic 
Models, Inc. (REMI)-EGAS growth factors, except for the aircraft/airport emissions in the HGB 
and DFW areas.  The 2005 and 2006 aircraft/airport emissions in the HGB and DFW areas were 
provided through a stakeholder process and these emissions are airport-specific rather than county-
level.  Summer weekend day emissions for the non- and off-road mobile source categories were 
developed as part of the EPS3 processing using category specific weekly activity profiles. 
  
Table 3-11:  2005 and 2006 Base Case Episode Non- and Off-Road Modeling Emissions for HGB 
summarizes the non- and off-road mobile source weekday emissions for each of the 2005 and 2006 
base case episodes for the eight-county HGB area.  Since these are average summer weekday, the 
2005 emissions are used for each of the 2005 base case episodes and the 2006 emissions are used 
for each of the 2006 base case episodes.

3.4.2.4  Area Sources 
Area source modeling emissions were developed using the EPA NEI and the TCEQ TexAER.  The 
emissions information in these databases was processed through EPS3 to generate the air quality 
model-ready area source emission files. 
 
Outside Texas 
For all the states beyond Texas, the TCEQ used the EPA’s 2002 NEI with EGAS5 growth factors 
to generate 2005 and 2006 daily area source emissions. 
 
Within Texas 
The TCEQ used 2005 TexAER to generate 2005 daily area source emissions and for the 2006 daily 
area source emissions, applied the Texas-specific REMI-EGAS growth factors. 
 
Since these are daily emissions, the 2005 emissions are used for each of the 2005 base case 
episodes and the 2006 emissions are used for each of the 2006 base case episodes.

3-23 
3.4.3  2006 Baseline 
In general, the baseline modeling emissions are based on typical ozone season emissions, whereas 
the base case modeling emissions are episode day-specific.  The biogenic emissions are an 
exception in that the same episode day-specific emissions are used in the 2006 baseline and base 
cases.  In addition, the 2006 baseline non- and off-road and area source modeling emissions are the 
same as used for the 2006 base case episodes, since they are based on typical ozone season 
emissions.  No fire emissions were included in the 2006 baseline. 
 
3.4.3.1  Point Sources 
For the non-ARD point sources, the 2006 baseline emissions are the same as the modeling 
emissions used for the June 2006 (bc06ep0) and the bc06aqs2 episodes.  The 2006 baseline ARD 
sources EGUs emissions were estimated using the average of the 2006 third quarter hourly ARD 
emissions.  The 2006 baseline tank landing emissions were estimated as the average of the tank 
landing emissions for those 2006 episode days with non-zero emissions.  The HRVOC emissions 
reconciliation developed for the 2006 base cases was used for the 2006 baseline.  For the Gulf of 
Mexico, Canada, and Mexico, the 2006 baseline uses the same emissions as the base cases. 
 
3.4.3.2  On-Road Mobile Sources 
The 2006 baseline on-road mobile source emissions are the same as used for the June 2006 
(bc06ep0) base case episode.  These are the summer season modeling emissions for each of the day 
types, weekday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
 
3.4.4  2018 Future Base and Control Strategy 
The biogenic emissions used for the 2018 future base and control strategy modeling are the same 
episode day-specific emissions used in the base cases.  In addition, similar to the 2006 baseline, no 
fire emissions were included in the 2018 future base and control strategy modeling. 
 
3.4.4.1  Point Sources 
Outside Texas 
The non-ARD point source emissions data in the regions outside Texas were obtained from the 
2018 CENRAP/RPO regional haze SIP.  For the Gulf, Canada, and Mexico, the 2018 emissions are 
the same as used in the 2006 baseline.  The CAIR Phase 2 emission levels were used for the EGU 
2018 emissions, with an adjustment for the ozone season.  The ozone season adjustment was 
developed using the ratio of the average of the 2006 third quarter hourly ARD emissions to the 
annual average ARD emissions. 
 
Within Texas 
Emissions for the non-ARD point sources were projected to 2018 using the larger of the Texas 
Industrial Production Index (TIPI) or Texas-specific REMI EGAS growth factors (or banked 
Emissions Reduction Credits and Discrete Emissions Reduction Credits in nonattainment areas).  
Controls pertinent to existing HGB, DFW, and BPA SIP revisions were applied to appropriate 
point source categories (e.g., Mass Emissions Cap and Trade program (MECT), HRVOC 
Emissions Cap and Trade program (HECT), and East Texas Combustion Rule).  The 2018 future 
base emissions for HECT-applicable point sources in Harris County used their HECT allocations.  
The 2018 control strategy includes a 25 percent reduction (2.69 tpd) to the HECT cap for 
applicable point sources in Harris County.  
 
Similar to the 2018 emissions for ARD sources outside Texas, the ARD sources within Texas used 
the CAIR Phase 2 emissions adjusted to the ozone season, with the exception of ARD sources in 
the eight-county HGB area, which are subject to the MECT rule.  The 2018 emissions for ARD 
sources within the HGB area used the MECT allocations adjusted to the ozone season, similar to 
the adjustment for the ARD sources in the non-HGB area.  Newly-permitted ARD sources were 
limited to the CAIR 9.5 percent set-aside for growth.  The 2018 tank landing emissions were the 

 
3-24 
same as the 2006 baseline, but the HRVOC reconciliation was reduced by the amount in Harris 
County associated with HECT applicable source categories. 
 
For the eight-county HGB area, the point source NOX emissions are reduced by about 5 percent 
from the 2006 baseline (172.16 tpd) to the 2018 future base (162.75 tpd) and the VOC emissions 
are increased about 48 percent from the 2006 baseline (208.34 tpd) to the 2018 future base (309.46 
tpd).  The 25 percent HECT control strategy reduces the 2018 control strategy VOC emissions to 
306.75 tpd. 
 
3.4.4.2  On-Road Mobile Sources 
Outside Texas 
The TCEQ used the EPA’s NMIM to generate average summer weekday mobile source emissions 
by county for 2018 for all of the states beyond Texas.  Average summer Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday mobile source emissions were estimated using the weekday to Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday ratios developed for the on-road mobile source emissions within Texas. 
 
Within Texas 
For the Texas counties outside of the HGB and BPA areas, summer season, day type, non-link on-
road emissions were developed by TTI using 2018 projected traffic data and the EPA’s 
MOBILE6.2.  For the eight-county HGB and three-county BPA (Jefferson, Hardin, and Orange) 
areas, link-based on-road emissions were developed by TTI using the TDM output projected for 
2018, and the EPA’s MOBILE6.2 on-road mobile source emissions model to generate average 
summer season on-road emissions for the four day types.  The 2018 control strategy includes a 1.55 
tpd Voluntary Mobile Emission Reduction Program (VMEP) NOX reduction to the on-road mobile 
sources for alternative commuting, vehicle retrofit and replacement, and traffic flow improvement 
measures.   
 
For the eight-county HGB area, the on-road mobile source NOX emissions are reduced by about 74 
percent from the 2006 baseline (197.28 tpd) to the 2018 future base (50.76 tpd) and the VOC 
emissions are decreased about 49 percent from the 2006 baseline (99.39 tpd) to the 2018 future 
base (50.39 tpd).  The VMEP control strategies reduce the 2018 control strategy NOX emissions to 
49.21 tpd. 
 
3.4.4.3  Non- and Off-Road Mobile Sources 
Outside Texas 
For the states outside of Texas, the TCEQ used the EPA’s NMIM to generate average summer 
weekday non-road mobile source category emissions by county for 2018.  For the off-road mobile 
source categories, aircraft, locomotive, and marine, in the states beyond Texas, the TCEQ used the 
EPA’s 2002 NEI with EGAS5 growth factors and national controls for locomotives and marine 
vessels to generate 2018 average summer weekday off-road mobile source category emissions.  
Summer weekend day emissions for the non- and off-road mobile source categories were 
developed as part of the EPS3 processing using category specific weekly activity profiles. 
 
Within Texas 
The TCEQ used the TexN model to generate average summer weekday non-road mobile source 
category emissions by county for 2018.  2018 county-level off-road emissions were estimated by 
adjusting the 2005 TexAER emissions with the Texas-specific REMI-EGAS growth factors, except 
for the aircraft/airport emissions in the HGB and DFW areas and marine vessels in HGB and BPA.  
The 2018 aircraft/airport emissions in the HGB and DFW areas were provided through a 
stakeholder process and these emissions are airport-specific rather than county-level.  The 2018 
emissions for marine vessels in HGB and BPA were developed using emission trends provided by 
the HGB and BPA Port Authorities (Starcrest, 2000).  Summer weekend day emissions for the non- 
and off-road mobile source categories were developed as part of the EPS3 processing using 
category specific weekly activity profiles. 

 
3-25 
 
For the eight-county HGB area, the non- and off-road mobile source NOX emissions are reduced by 
about 20 percent from the 2006 baseline (152.40 tpd) to the 2018 future base (121.37 tpd) and the 
VOC emissions are decreased about 19 percent from the 2006 baseline (82.02 tpd) to the 2018 
future base (66.49 tpd).  The 2018 control strategy includes 0.70 tpd NOX reduction to non-road 
VMEP measures. 
 
3.4.4.4  Area Sources 
Outside Texas 
The TCEQ obtained emissions data used in the 2018 regional haze SIP revision that was created by 
the CENRAP/RPO for all the states beyond Texas.  
 
Within Texas 
The 2018 county-level area source emissions were estimated by adjusting the 2005 TexAER 
emissions with the Texas-specific REMI-EGAS growth factors, except for the flash emissions 
category.  Flash emissions will be controlled in the future as a result of the Storage Vessel and 
Degassing rule (30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 115), so no growth was applied and 
the same emissions were used for the 2018 future base and control strategy as the 2006 baseline. 
 
For the eight-county HGB area, the area source NOX emissions are increased by about 16 percent 
from the 2006 baseline (36.35 tpd) to the 2018 future base (42.04 tpd) and the VOC emissions are 
increased about 23 percent from the 2006 baseline (528.99 tpd) to the 2018 future base (650.09 
tpd).

3.5  PHOTOCHEMICAL MODELING 
To ensure that a modeling study can be successfully used as technical support for an attainment 
demonstration SIP revision, the air quality model must be scientifically sound and appropriate for 
the intended application and freely accessible to all stakeholders.  In a regulatory environment, it is 
crucial that oversight groups (e.g., the EPA), the regulated community, and the interested public 
have access to and also be convinced of the suitability of the model.  The following three 
prerequisites were identified for selecting the air quality model to be used in the HGB attainment 
demonstration: 
 

 
3-27 
• 
must have a reasonably current, peer-reviewed, scientific formulation; 
• 
must be available at no or low cost to stakeholders; and 
• 
must be consistent with air quality models being used for other Texas nonattainment or 
near nonattainment areas. 
 
The only model to meet all three of these criteria is CAMx.  The model is based on well-
established treatments of advection, diffusion, deposition, and chemistry.  Another important 
feature is that NOX emissions from large point sources can be treated with the PiG submodel, 
which helps avoid the artificial diffusion that occurs when point source emissions are introduced 
into a grid volume.  The model software and the CAMx user's guide are publicly available at 
http://www.camx.com (Environ, 2009).  In addition, the TCEQ has many years of experience with 
CAMx.  CAMx was used for the modeling conducted in the DFW and BPA nonattainment areas, 
as well as for modeling being conducted in other areas of Texas (e.g., San Antonio). 
 
CAMx Version 4.53 was used for this modeling study.  Some of the features in this version include 
the ability to process in parallel on multiple processors and the following probing tools for 
sensitivity analysis: 
 
• 
Process Analysis, which provides in depth details of ozone formation, showing the various 
physical and chemical processes that determine the modeled ozone concentrations at 
specified locations and times; 
• 
Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT), which estimates the contribution of 
emissions from multiple geographical areas and source categories to ozone formation 
(including biogenic emissions); and 
• 
Anthropogenic Precursor Culpability Assessment (APCA), which reallocates ozone 
apportioned to non-controllable biogenic emissions to the controllable portion of 
precursors that participated in ozone formation. 
 
3.5.1  Modeling Domains and Horizontal Grid Cell Size 
Figure 3-11:  CAMx Modeling Domains depicts the modeling domains used in CAMx.  The 
horizontal configuration of the CAMx modeling domains consist of a 2 km x 2 km grid (2 km) 
encompassing a major portion of the HGB nonattainment counties (red box), nested within a 4 km 
x 4 km grid (4 km) encompassing both the HGB and BPA counties (blue box), nested within a 12 
km x 12 km grid (12 km) covering the eastern part of Texas (green box), nested within the outer 
(black box) 36 km x 36 km grid (36km).  The 36 km outer domain was selected to minimize the 
effect of boundary conditions on predicted ozone concentrations. 
 

 
3-28 
Figure 3-11:  CAMx Modeling Domains 
 
 
All grids align with the grid developed by the EPA for nationwide modeling for regional haze and 
particulate matter.  Choosing a grid system compatible with an existing large-scale grid system 
serves several functions, including ability to use ready-made regional inventory data directly, 
ability to integrate the TCEQ’s modeling into regional modeling projects, and promoting 
consistency among various regional and urban modeling applications in the central United States. 
 
A finer resolution subdomain within the 4 km HGB-BPA domain better replicates the emission 
gradients in the narrow industrial plumes emanating from the Ship Channel and surrounding areas.   

 
3-29 
3.5.2  Vertical Layer Structure 
The vertical configuration of the CAMx modeling domains consists of 28 layers of varying depth 
used with the 2 km and 4 km domains, and 17 layers of varying depth used with the 12 km and 36 
km horizontal domains.  The unique meteorology induced by the land/sea/bay effects and the 
diverse mixture of industrial source types, which release pollutants across a wide range of 
elevations, require more vertical layers, particularly near ground level, in the fine-grid domains.  
Table 3-14:  CAMx Vertical Layer Structure for 2 km and 4 km Fine Grids and Table 3-15:  CAMx 
Vertical Layer Structure for Intermediate and Coarse Grids show the vertical structuring of the 28-
layered and 17-layered configurations, respectively.

3.5.3  Model Configuration 
The TCEQ used CAMx version 4.53, which includes a number of upgrades and features from 
previous versions.  The following CAMx 4.53 options were employed: 
• 
Parallel processing of the chemistry and transport algorithms; 
• 
CB05 chemical mechanism with Euler Backward Iterative (EBI) chemistry solver; 
• 
Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) advection solver; 
• 
Flexi-nesting to interpolate the 4 km meteorological parameters to the 2 km CAMx 
domain; and 
• 
PiG treatment of larger point sources of NOX using the Greatly Reduced Execution and 
Simplified Dynamics (GREASD) Lagrangian module. 
 
In addition to the CAMx inputs developed from the meteorological and emissions modeling, inputs 
are needed for initial and boundary conditions, spatially resolved surface characteristic parameters, 
spatially resolved albedo/haze/ozone (i.e., opacity) and photolysis rates, and a chemistry 
parameters file. 
 
The TCEQ contracted with Environ (Environ, 2008b) who worked with National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to derive episode-specific 
boundary conditions from the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART) global 
air quality model.  Boundary conditions were developed for each grid cell along all four edges of 
the 36 km domain (number of horizontal grid cells [69 or 67 for east-west or north-south edges, 
respectively] times the number of vertical layers [17]) for each episode hour.  This work also 
produced initial conditions for each of the episodes.  The TCEQ used these episode-specific initial 
and boundary conditions for this modeling study.  The top-boundary conditions were set at the 
clean concentration levels as previously derived by Environ and used in the recently approved 
DFW Ozone Attainment Demonstration SIP revision (TCEQ, 2007). 
 
Surface characteristic parameters, including roughness, vegetative distribution, and water/land 
boundaries, are input to CAMx via a land-use file.  The land-use file provides the fractional 
contribution (0 to 1) of eleven land-use categories, as defined by the United States Geological 
Survey (USGS) LULC database.  For the 36 km and 12 km domains, the TCEQ used the land-use 
files developed by Environ for the DFW SIP revision approved by the EPA in 2009, which were 

 
3-31 
derived from the most recent USGS LULC database.  For the 2 km domain and portions of the 4 
km domain, in the vicinity of HGB, the TCEQ used updated land-use files developed by Texas 
A&M University (Popescu et al., 2008), which were derived from more highly resolved LULC data 
collected by the Texas Forest Service and the UT-CSR. 
 
The spatially-resolved opacity and photolysis rates are input to CAMx via a photolysis rates file 
and an opacity file, which are specific to the chemistry parameters file for the CB05 mechanism, 
which is also input to CAMx.  The TCEQ used episode-specific satellite data from the Total Ozone 
Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) to prepare the photolysis rates and opacity files. 
 
3.5.4  Model Performance Evaluation 
The CAMx model configuration was applied to the 2005 and 2006 base cases using the episode-
specific meteorological parameters and emissions.  The CAMx modeling results were compared to 
the measured ozone and ozone precursor concentrations, which resulted in a number of modeling 
iterations involving improvements to the meteorological and emissions modeling and subsequent 
CAMx modeling.  A detailed performance evaluation for each of the 2005 and 2006 base case 
modeling episodes is included in Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment 
Demonstration SIP.  In addition, all performance evaluation products are available on the TCEQ 
FTP site (TCEQ, 2009). 
 
3.5.4.1  Performance Evaluations Overview 
The performance evaluation of the base case modeling demonstrates the adequacy of the model to 
correctly replicate the relationship between levels of ozone and the emissions of NOX and VOC.  
The model’s ability to suitably replicate this relationship is necessary to have confidence in the 
model’s prediction of the response of ozone to various control measures.  As recommended in the 
EPA modeling guidance, the TCEQ conducted two types of performance evaluations, operational 
and diagnostic.  
 
3.5.4.2  Operational Evaluations 
Statistical measures including the Unpaired Peak Accuracy (UPA), the Mean Normalized Bias 
(MNB), and the Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) were calculated by comparing measured 
and bi-linearly interpolated modeled ozone concentrations for all episode days and regulatory 
monitors.  Graphical measures including time series and scatter plots of hourly measured and bi-
linearly interpolated modeled ozone and where applicable, some ozone precursors (e.g., nitric 
oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ETH, and CO) concentrations were developed for each 
regulatory monitor.  In addition, tile plots of modeled daily maximum eight-hour ozone 
concentrations were developed and overlaid with the measured daily maximum eight-hour ozone 
concentrations.  Detailed operational evaluations for each of the 2005 and 2006 base case modeling 
episodes are included in Appendix C: CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.  
 
Statistical Evaluations 
The statistical evaluations presented focus on the comparison of the measured and modeled eight-
hour ozone concentrations.  Figure 3-12.a:  Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration, Measured 
versus Modeled for the 2005 Episode Days and Figure 3-12.b:  Peak Eight-Hour Ozone 
Concentration, Measured versus Modeled for the 2006 Episode Days compare the measured and 
modeled peak eight-hour ozone concentrations for each episode day of the 2005 and 2006 base 
cases, respectively.  Figure 3-13.a:  Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) and Bias (MNB) for 
2005 Episode Days and Figure 3-13.b:  Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) and Bias (MNB) 
for 2006 Episode Days show the MNGE and MNB for monitored eight-hour ozone concentrations 
greater than 40 ppb for each episode day of the 2005 and 2006 base cases, respectively.  Although 
there are no recommended criteria for the eight-hour UPA, MNGE, and MNB, the one-hour levels 
recommended by the EPA (i.e., plus or minus 20 percent, 30 percent, and plus or minus 15 percent, 
respectively) were used for statistical evaluations. 
 

 
3-32 
The error bars on the daily peak measured eight-hour ozone concentrations, in Figures 3-12.a: Peak 
Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration, Measured versus Modeled for the 2005 Episode Days and 3-
12.b:  Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration, Measured versus Modeled for the 2006 Episode 
Days represent the plus or minus 20 percent UPA range for comparison with the daily peak 
modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations.  For the 37 episode days in the 2005 base cases, only 
seven days have daily peak modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations greater than 20 percent of the 
daily peak measured eight-hour ozone concentrations.  For the 50 episode days in the 2006 base 
cases only ten days have daily peak modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations outside the plus or 
minus 20 percent UPA range.

Figure 3-12.b:  Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration, Measured versus Modeled for the 
2006 Episode Days 
 
 
Taking into consideration that only 17 days out of the 87 days modeled in the 2005 and 2006 base 
case episodes have daily peak modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations outside the plus or minus 
20 percent UPA range, the model suitably predicts the daily peak eight-hour ozone concentrations.

The area depicted in Figures 3-12.a: Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) and Bias (MNB) for 
2005 Episode Days and 3-12.b: Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) and Bias (MNB) for 2006 
Episode Days with MNGE < 30 percent and MNB < plus or minus 15 percent represents the joint 
condition for which both the MNGE and MNB are within acceptable ranges.  The episode days 
labeled in red indicate those days for which daily peak measured eight-hour ozone concentrations 
were greater than or equal to 80 ppb. 
 
For the 31 days of the 2005 base case episodes with daily peak measured eight-hour ozone 
concentrations greater than or equal to 80 ppb 19 days meet the joint condition of having both the 
MNGE < 30 percent and MNB < plus or minus 15 percent.  The average peak monitored ozone for 
those 31 days was 93.9 ppb, and the corresponding average peak modeled ozone concentration was 
101.1 ppb.  The average mean normalized bias and mean normalized gross error were 11.4 and 
19.0 percent, respectively. 
 
For the 36 days of the 2006 base case episodes with daily peak measured eight-hour ozone 
concentrations greater than or equal to 80 ppb, 24 days meet the joint condition of having both the 
MNGE < 30 percent and MNB < plus or minus 15 percent.  The average peak monitored ozone for 
those 36 days was 96.9 ppb, and the corresponding average peak modeled ozone concentration was 
95.1 ppb.  The average mean normalized bias and normalized gross error were 8.8 and 16.9 percent, 
respectively. 
 
Taking into consideration that 43 days out of the 67 episode days in the 2005 and 2006 base cases 
with daily peak measured eight-hour ozone concentration greater than or equal to 80 ppb meet the 
joint condition of having both the MNGE < 30 percent and MNB < plus or minus 15 percent, the 
model suitably predicts the temporal pattern of daily eight-hour ozone concentrations at the various 
monitors.

Graphical Evaluations 
A detailed graphical evaluation of modeling results is presented in Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling 
for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.  A selection of graphical evaluations, organized by 
episode modeled, is presented in this section.   
 
For each of the 2005 and 2006 base case episodes, time series comparing hourly measured (red 
dots) and modeled (blue line) ozone concentrations are shown for three monitors in the eight-
county HGB area.  The monitors presented vary by episode and were selected on the basis of 
ozone measured.  Included on the time-series graphic is the modeled maximum and minimum 
hourly ozone concentration within the 7 x 7 grid cell array around the monitor (green shading).  
Additionally, time series comparing hourly measured and modeled ozone concentrations are 
shown for two or three rural monitors (GRVL and LACT, and SAGA, which was not in operation 
during bc05ep0 and bc05ep1).  Figure 3-14: TexAQS II Monitoring Sites Outside HGB/BPA is a 
map of rural monitors.

Also included for each of the episodes are logarithmically-scaled scatter plots comparing the 
hourly measured and modeled concentrations of ozone (O3), NOX, ETH, and olefins (OLE).  
Monitor sites included in the graphical representation were the three monitors with the highest 
daily maximum monitored eight-hour ozone concentrations.  If one of the top three sites did not 
also have an auto-GC, the third highest ozone monitoring site was replaced by the auto-GC site 
measuring the highest ozone.  OLE is a CAMx chemical surrogate representing olefinic VOC, 
such as propylene, but excluding ethylene and certain compounds known as internal olefins such 

 
3-39 
                                                
as butenes (internal olefins are represented in CB05 by the surrogate species IOLE).  Both 
ethylene and propylene are HRVOC and their emissions were adjusted in the base case modeling 
by the emissions reconciliation discussed previously in Section 3.4:  Emissions Modeling.  
Included on the scatter plots is the measured versus modeled Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot, which 
first sorts independently both the measured and modeled concentrations, then plots the sorted 
values together.  QQ plot data, shown as red dots, provide a measure of how close the modeled 
and measured distributions of values are to each other.  If the red dots lie close to the diagonal 
one-to-one line, the model generates the correct proportions of small, medium, and large 
concentration values. 
 
Tile plots of the of the daily peak modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations are shown for 
selected episode days on which several monitors measured maximum daily eight-hour ozone 
concentrations greater than 84 ppb.  Included on the tile plots are the monitor locations 
represented by small circles, color coded for the measured ozone concentration.  The same scale 
is used for the measured and modeled maximum daily eight-hour ozone concentrations. 
 
Bc05ep0: May 19 through June 3, 2005 
For the bc05ep0 episode, hourly time series are presented for the Conroe Relocated (CNR2; 
CAMS 78), Northwest Harris County (HNWA; CAMS 26), and Wallisville Road (WALV; 
CAMS 617)1 monitors in Figure 3-15:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode 
bc05ep0 at the CNR2, HNWA, and WALV Monitors.  In general, the modeled ozone 
concentrations, including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, replicate the diurnal pattern of 
the observations.  The lower ozone concentrations measured during the early morning hours, 
especially at the Conroe Relocated monitor, and the very highest ozone concentrations, for 
example, Northwest Harris County, May 27, 2005, were less well replicated.  The unfavorable 
comparison between the measured and modeled hourly ozone concentrations during the early 
morning hours at the Conroe Relocated monitor is likely due to local factors, such as NOX 
emissions and low wind speed meteorological conditions, which reduces the areal representation 
of the monitor to much less than the 4 km grid cell size on which the modeled concentration is 
simulated.  Thus, this disparity is not necessarily an indication of poor model performance since 
local factors may create greater ozone gradients.

Figure 3-16:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc05ep0 at the GRVL and 
LACT Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, except for the latter part of the episode in the rural region represented by the 
LACT monitor, for which the modeled concentrations are relatively constant throughout the day.  
The lower ozone concentrations measured during the early morning hours on some days and not 
replicated by the model are likely due to localized emissions and meteorology limiting the areal 
representation of the monitors as described previously.  Overall, modeled and measured rural 
concentrations compare favorably, and modeled rural concentrations are unlikely to cause any 
substantial predictive bias within the HGB area during this episode.

Scatter plots for the bc05ep0 episode comparing the hourly measured and modeled concentrations 
at the  Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor (non-regulatory monitor) are shown in Figure 3-17:  
Scatter Plots of Hourly Ozone, NOX, ETH, and OLE at the WALV Monitor for the bc05ep0 
Episode.  The model tends to over-predict ozone at the lower measured concentrations (less than 
60 ppb), but compares favorably at the higher ozone concentrations.  Conversely, the model tends 
to under-predict the NOX at the lower measured concentrations, but compares favorably at the 
higher NOX concentrations.  The rank correlation QQ plot for ETH is quite favorable, although 
there is notable scatter in the individual hourly comparisons.  The model tends to under-predict 
the lower and higher OLE concentrations.

Tile plots of daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentrations for May 27, May 31, June 1, and 
June 2, 2005, are shown in Figure 3-18:  Tile Plots of Daily Maximum Eight-Hour Ozone 
Concentrations for May 27 and 31 and June 1 through 2, 2005.  The dots represent the monitored 
value, whereas the background color represents the modeled results.  Where a dot’s color matches 
the surrounding color, the model has accurately replicated the measured ozone at that monitor. 
The model replicates the areas of highest eight-hour ozone for the selected days, with the

Bc05ep1:  June 17 through 30, 2005 
For the bc05ep1 episode, hourly time series are presented for the Deer Park (DRPK; CAMS 35), 
Houston Croquet (HCQA; CAMS 409) and Manvel Croix Park (MACP; CAMS 84) monitors in 
Figure 3-19:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc05ep1 at the DRPK, 
HCQA, and MACP Monitors.  In general the modeled ozone concentrations, including the 7 x 7 
cell maximum-minimum range, replicate the diurnal pattern of the observations, with the 
exception of the lower ozone concentrations measured during the early morning hours, especially 
at the Manvel Croix Park (CAMS 84) monitor.

Figure 3-20:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc05ep1 at the GRVL and 
LACT Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, with generally favorable comparisons during the daytime.  The model does 
not replicate the lower ozone concentrations measured on some days during the early morning 
hours, likely for reasons previously discussed.  Overall, modeled and measured rural 
concentrations compare favorably, and modeled rural concentrations are unlikely to cause any 
substantial predictive bias within the HGB area during this episode.

Scatter plots for the bc05ep1 episode comparing the hourly measured and modeled concentrations 
at the Deer Park (CAMS 35) monitor are shown in Figure 3-21: Scatter Plots of Hourly Ozone, 
NOX, ETH, and OLE at the DRPK Monitor for the bc05ep1 Episode.  The model tends to over-
predict ozone at the lower measured concentrations, but compares quite favorably at the higher 
ozone concentrations.  The model tends to generally over-predict the NOX, especially at the lower 
measured concentrations.  The QQ plot for ETH is quite favorable, although there is some scatter 
in the individual hourly comparisons.  The model tends to under-predict the lower OLE 
concentrations and while the QQ plot shows a favorable rank correlation, there is notable scatter 
in the individual hourly comparisons.

620) (non-regulatory monitor) monitors in Figure 3-23:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone 
Concentrations for Episode bc05ep2 at the BAYP, HROC, and TXCT Monitors.  Relatively high 
ozone concentrations were measured at these monitors on several days during this episode.  In 
general, the modeled ozone concentrations, including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, 
replicate the diurnal pattern of the observations, with the exception of the lower ozone 
concentrations measured during the early morning hours, especially at the Houston Bayland Park  
(CAMS 53) monitor.

Figure 3-24:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc05ep2 at the GRVL,

concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, with a tendency to over-predict the peak hourly ozone concentrations during 
the daytime.  The over-prediction at these rural monitors appears to follow the same pattern as the 
over-prediction of ozone concentrations in the HGB area, especially during the latter part of the 
episode.

at the TXCT monitor (non-regulatory monitor) are shown in Figure 3-25:  Scatter Plots of Hourly

tends to over-predict ozone, especially at the lower measured concentrations.  Although the QQ 
plot indicates a favorable rank correlation for the NOX, there is notable scatter in the individual 
hourly comparisons.  The QQ plot for ETH indicates an even more favorable rank correlation, 
again with notable scatter in the individual hourly comparisons.  The model tends to under-
predict the lower and higher OLE concentrations, also with considerable scatter in the individual 
hourly comparisons.

617) (non-regulatory monitor) monitors in Figure 3-27:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone 
Concentrations for Episode bc06ep0 at the HROC, SHWH, and WALV Monitors.  Relatively high 
ozone concentrations were measured at these monitors on several days during this episode.  In 
general, the modeled ozone concentrations, including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, 
replicate the diurnal pattern of the observations, with the exception of the lower ozone 
concentrations measured during the early morning hours, especially at the Shell Westhollow 
(CAMS 410) monitor.

Episode.  The model tends to over-predict ozone at the lower measured concentrations, but 
compares more favorably at the higher concentrations.  Conversely, the model tends to under-
predict NOX at the lower measured concentrations, and slightly over-predict at the higher NOX 
concentrations.  The QQ plot for ETH indicates a somewhat favorable rank correlation, although 
the model generally tends to under-predict the ETH concentrations.  The model also tends to 
under-predict the OLE concentrations.

in Figure 3-31:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06aqs1 at the BAYP, 
DRPK, and HSMA Monitors.  Relatively high ozone concentrations were measured at these 
monitors on several days during this episode.  In general, the modeled ozone concentrations, 
including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, replicate the diurnal pattern of the 
observations, with the exception of the very highest measured hourly ozone concentrations.

Figure 3-32:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06aqs1 at the GRVL, 
LACT, and SAGA Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, with generally favorable comparisons during the daytime, with the exception 
of the region represented by the GRVL monitor on August 31 and September 1, 2006, when the 
higher measured ozone concentrations are notably under-predicted.  In addition, the model tends 
to over-predict the ozone concentrations during the first segment of this episode, August 15 
through 22, 2006, in the regions represented by LACT and SAGA monitors.  Again, the model 
does not replicate the lower ozone concentrations measured on some days during the early 
morning hours.  Overall, modeled and measured rural concentrations compare favorably enough 
that the modeled rural concentrations are unlikely to cause any substantial predictive bias within 
the HGB area during this episode.

Bc06aqs2:  September 16 through October 11, 2006 
For the bc06aqs2 episode, hourly time series are presented for the Conroe Relocated (CNR2;

Figure 3-35:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06aqs2 at the CNR2, 
DRPK, and GALV Monitors.  Relatively high ozone concentrations were measured at these 
monitors on several days during this episode.  In general, the modeled ozone concentrations, 
including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, replicate the diurnal pattern of the 
observations, with the exception of the lower ozone concentrations measured during the early 
morning hours, especially at the Conroe Relocated (CAMS 78) monitor.

Figure 3-36:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06aqs2 at the GRVL, 
LACT, and SAGA Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations.  However, the model performance in the rural areas represented by these 
monitors varies for the different segments of the episode.  For example, during the first segment, 
the model notably under-predicts the peak daytime ozone concentrations at all three monitors but 
compares more favorably with the peak daytime ozone concentrations measured during the 
middle portion of the third segment.  Again, the model does not replicate the lower ozone 
concentrations measured on some days during the early morning hours.  Overall, modeled and 
measured rural concentrations compare favorably enough that the modeled rural concentrations 
are unlikely to cause any substantial predictive bias within the HGB area during this episode.

concentrations at the Deer Park (CAMS 35) monitor are shown in Figure 3-37:  Scatter Plots of

there is a favorable comparison for the mid-range and higher ozone concentrations, with a slight 
tendency for the model to over-predict the measured concentrations.  Although the QQ plot for 
NOX indicates a favorable rank correlation, the model tends to generally over-predict the NOX 
concentrations.  The QQ plot for ETH also indicates a favorable rank correlation, although the 
model tends to over-predict the lower concentrations and under-predict the higher ETH 
concentrations.  The model tends to under-predict the lower range of OLE concentrations with 
considerable scatter in the higher concentrations.

Evaluations Based on TexAQS II Data 
Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP includes extensive 
comparisons of model predictions with observations collected by the many platforms employed 
during TexAQS II.  This section provides general descriptions of the major sampling platforms 
employed and presents highlights of some of the conclusions reached based on these comparisons. 
In graphics comparing TexAQS II observations with modeled output, observational data are 

 
3-64 
typically labeled as mixing ratios, which report moles of the pollutant per mole of ambient air.  In 
practical terms, the term mixing ratio is synonymous with concentration. 
 
Rural Monitoring Network 
The TexAQS II study included a number of additional monitoring sites, which began collecting 
data in the summer of 2005 and continued until late October, 2006.  During the TexAQS II 
intensive period, August 1 through October 15, 2006, a total of nine additional ozone monitors 
had been deployed in rural areas.  Two of these additional monitors were the CLVL monitor near 
the Texas Oklahoma border, which also collected NOX and total reactive nitrogen (NOY) during 
this period, and the SAGA monitor, which collected NOX in addition to ozone.  The SAGA 
monitor, discussed in the previous section, was one of those deployed for TexAQS II.  A full 
discussion of model performance at these and other rural monitors is provided in Appendix C:  
CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.   
 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP3-3D Orion 
The NOAA WP-3D (P3) flew missions in the area between August 31 and October 13, 2006, and 
sampled many species not routinely monitored, including formaldehyde, NOY, nitric acid, and a 
suite of reactive hydrocarbons.  Figure 3-39:  Comparison of Modeled and P3 Observed Ozone 
(O3), August 31, 2006, 14:16 to 15:33 CST, illustrates the flight of August 31, 2006, as the 
aircraft first arrived from Florida.  The top two panels compare observed and modeled ozone 
concentrations (referred to on the plots as mixing ratio) along the flight track, while the bottom 
two compare the observed and modeled concentrations as a time series and a scatter plot 
superimposed with a QQ plot.  The results are consistent with Figure 3-34:  Tile Plot of Daily 
Maximum Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations for August 17 and 31, and September 1 and 7, 2006, 
which showed that the model correctly placed the highest ozone concentrations geographically, 
but did not replicate the magnitude of the highest observations at the surface.  The P3 flight 
shows that at the elevation of the aircraft, around 500 meters above ground level (AGL), the 
model also replicated the position of the highest ozone concentrations, but, as above, the model 
did not replicate the high concentrations seen in western Harris County.

Figure 3-39:  Comparison of Modeled and P3 Observed Ozone (O3), August 31, 2006, 14:16 
to 15:33 CST 
 
 
The model’s under-prediction of the highest observed ozone concentrations was common 
throughout most of the flights.  A detailed discussion of model comparisons with P3 data can be 
found in Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.  Some of the 
conclusions reached are that the model usually replicated the winds observed by the P3 well and 
even in cases where it showed a directional bias, usually placed the highest ozone concentrations 
in about the right location.  The model reproduced the observed NOX concentrations well, but 
over-predicted CO.  Most hydrocarbon species were under-predicted by the model, even after the 
HRVOC reconciliation, as was formaldehyde on most occasions.  Isoprene concentrations were 
generally modeled well, but some high modeled isoprene concentrations did not match the 
observations.  
 
NOAA Twin Otter Tunable Optical Profiler for Aerosol and oZone (TOPAZ) 
A second NOAA aircraft, a Twin Otter, carried a downward-looking lidar tuned to ozone and 
aerosol loading called TOPAZ.  Data from this instrument were valuable because they allowed 
modeled ozone to be compared with measurements vertically through up to 3,000 meters AGL.  
The instrument was flown on 13 missions between August 15 and September 13, 2006.  The top 
two panels of Figure 3-40:  TOPAZ-Observed and Modeled Ozone Concentrations on August 31, 
2006 compare observed and measured ozone concentrations between 255 and 377 meters AGL, 
which is the fifth vertical modeling layer.  The lower plots are ozone curtains, showing ozone 
concentrations from the surface up to the aircraft elevation along the entire flight path and show 
that at around 15:00 the under-prediction carried upwards to over 1,500 meters.  The TOPAZ 
concentrations near the surface are highly variable and may include contamination from surface 
features and thus, may not accurately reflect ozone concentrations within the first 200 meters.   
 

 
3-66 
 
Figure 3-40:  TOPAZ-Observed and Modeled Ozone Concentrations on August 31, 2006 
 
 
Like the P3, the TOPAZ also showed that the model usually placed the highest ozone 
concentrations in the correct location, but generally under-predicted the observed peak 
concentrations.  A comparison between the TOPAZ measurements of ozone concentration with 
those made by the P3 (the two flew together on only two days), showed relatively good 
agreement.  The TOPAZ measured ozone concentrations above the mixed layer on most days that 
were notably higher than the model predicted. 
 
The Research Vessel (RV) Ronald H. Brown 
The NOAA RV Ron Brown arrived in the HGB area on August 15, 2006, and collected data until 
its departure on September 13.  The ship carried a wide array of sampling platforms onboard and 
provided extensive data collected in the Gulf of Mexico, Galveston Bay, and in the Houston Ship 
Channel.  Figure 3-41:  Comparison of Ozone Concentrations Observed by the RV Ron Brown 
with Modeled Concentrations, August 31, 2006, 08:00 to 16:30, compares observed and modeled 
ozone for the period from 8:00 to 16:30 on August 31.  The ship sailed from Barbour’s Cut into 
the Gulf of Mexico, and then along the coast to near Freeport.  This figure shows that the model 
predicted the observed concentrations of ozone very well from Barbour’s Cut to Galveston and 
then showed a brief period of over-prediction as the observed concentrations dipped between 
11:00 and 12:00.  The decrease in measured ozone concentrations coincided with a period of very 
high NOX concentrations observed in the channel between Galveston Island and Bolivar 
Peninsula.  The observed NOX was probably emitted by local ship traffic and likely reduced the 
ozone concentrations through titration.  As the ship sailed into the Gulf of Mexico, it measured 
unusually high ozone concentrations moving onshore, which the model under-predicted.  This 
under-prediction may be the result of long-range transport or of model boundary conditions that 
are too low on this day.  As an alternative, the under-prediction may have resulted from air 
advected out into the Gulf of Mexico the previous day from the Houston or Beaumont areas.  

 
3-67 
More often, the ship encountered low ozone concentrations in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly 
under southerly wind conditions, which the model often over-predicted. 
 
 
Figure 3-41:  Comparison of Ozone Concentrations Observed by the RV Ron Brown with 
Modeled Concentrations, August 31, 2006, 08:00 to 16:30 
 
 
Ozone Sondes 
A number of ozone sondes, lightweight and compact balloon-borne instruments, were launched 
from the University of Houston (UH) campus southeast of downtown Houston and also from the 
deck of the RV Ron Brown in 2006.  Ozone monitors attached to these balloons provide an 
opportunity to evaluate the model’s vertical ozone distribution.  Figure 3-42:  Comparison of 
Modeled and Observed Vertical Ozone Profiles from Two Sonde Launches at UH Campus and 
One Sonde Launch from the RV Ron Brown in the Gulf of Mexico, August 31, 2006, shows three 
vertical ozone profiles measured by sondes launched from the UH campus on August 31, 2006, 
compared with modeled concentrations on that day.  The left-hand panel shows that for the 
morning (6:00 a.m.) launch from the UH campus, ozone concentrations fluctuated with altitude 
within the first 1,500 meters.  This effect may not represent actual variability in concentrations, 
however, since the measurements made by the sondes launched from UH were susceptible to 
interference by sulfur dioxide (SO2); each molecule of SO2 encountered by the instrument 
effectively cancels out one molecule of ozone.  Because there are numerous SO2 sources 
relatively close to the UH campus, it is very likely that the balloon may have encountered one of 
these plumes during ascent. 
 
Aside from the fluctuations, the model replicated ozone concentrations reasonably well up to 
around 1,200 meters.  The model under-predicted ozone concentrations up to about 5,000 meters, 
but predicted concentrations fairly well above that altitude.  At 12:29 p.m. (center panel), the 
model slightly over-predicted ozone concentrations near the surface, but observed ozone 
concentrations increased dramatically within the first 100 meters or so to 30 ppb greater than 

 
3-68 
modeled concentrations.  Unlike the notches seen in the morning launch, this effect is most likely 
caused by ozone scavenging by nearby NOX sources, probably vehicular traffic.  More 
significantly, after the first few meters, the model continued to under-predict observed ozone 
concentrations up to 4,000 meters. 
 
The right-hand panel of Figure 3-42:  Comparison of Modeled and Observed Vertical Ozone 
Profiles from Two Sonde Launches at UH Campus and one Sonde Launch from the RV Ron 
Brown in the Gulf of Mexico, August 31, 2006 shows ozone concentrations observed and modeled 
for a sonde launch from the deck of the RV Ron Brown, coincident with the 12:29 p.m. launch 
from the UH.  In this case, the model initially over-predicted ozone concentrations near the 
surface by 15 ppb, but within the first 100 meters or so the sonde recorded a drop in ozone 
concentrations, followed by a rapid rise.  This feature is probably due to the balloon encountering 
sulfate emissions from a ship plume, possibly from a passing ship or from the Ron Brown.  The 
modeled and observed profiles crossed at about 1,200 meters, and then the observations exceeded 
the model by 10 to 20 ppb up to 4,000 meters.  Farther above, the observations oscillated around 
the modeled values.

Moody Tower 
The Moody Tower site is located atop a dormitory on the UH campus southeast of downtown 
Houston.  The site is useful because it is located 60 meters AGL (in model layer 2), hence is 
insulated from some of the more localized emission sources.  Much of the Moody Tower data has 
been incorporated into the standard model performance evaluation processing performed at the 

 
3-69 
TCEQ for surface sites, with special provisions to use modeled concentrations from layer 2 
instead of layer 1.  Within this framework, the Moody Tower data offers measurements of some 
atmospheric constituents explicitly tracked in the CB05 mechanism, including nitric acid, nitrous 
acid, and formaldehyde.  In addition, researchers at this site collected a wealth of information on 
radicals associated with photochemical ozone production.  These data are used in conjunction 
with CAMx Chemical Process Analysis in Section 5.1:  QUANTITATIVE CORROBORATIVE 
ANALYSIS of this document. 
 
Other TexAQS II Data 
During TexAQS II, formaldehyde data were collected at two sites, Lynchburg Ferry and Houston 
Regional Monitor-3.  These data have been incorporated into the TCEQ model performance 
evaluation database and are being used in routine comparisons between modeled and observed 
concentrations. 
 
Some additional TexAQS II data have not yet been used for model performance evaluation 
because they were not yet available in a usable form, but may be useful in the future.  These data 
sources include the Houston Triangle project, the Baylor Aztec flights, the Solar Occultation Flux 
(SOF) measurements, “smart” balloon data, Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy 
(DOAS) observations, and satellite observations. 
 
3.5.4.3  Diagnostic Evaluations 
Since future design values are based solely on the model’s relative response and not on the 
magnitude of its future case ozone predictions, evaluating the model’s response to emission 
changes becomes at least as important as evaluation of its ability to reproduce historically 
observed events.  The EPA modeling guidance recommends several possible means of assessing 
model response to emission changes.  However, most of these methods are either indirect 
(probing tools, alternative base cases, most observation-based models) or are difficult to employ 
in practice (retrospective analyses).  In this section the TCEQ employs three tests to evaluate the 
model’s response to emission changes.  The first of these is a sensitivity analysis designed to test 
the model’s response to a hypothetical inventory change, specifically, an increase in emissions 
from flares.  The second test is a retrospective analysis that uses an existing 2000 baseline 
inventory to test the model’s ability to predict ozone design values in a previous year.  The third, 
a weekday-weekend analysis, is based on observational modeling designed to assess an area’s 
VOC- or NOX-sensitivity.  
 
Flare Sensitivity Modeling 
The TCEQ has been evaluating flares as a potential source of underreported VOC emissions since 
TexAQS 2000.  Flare monitoring requirements in the HRVOC rules in 30 TAC Chapter 115, 
Subchapter H, Division 1, were adopted in 2002 and designed to provide more accurate 
information on HRVOC and total flow rate to the flares.  More recently, the TCEQ has been 
evaluating potential issues with the destruction efficiencies used to calculate emissions from 
flares.  Due to the open combustion nature of flares, direct measurement of flare emissions or 
verification of flare destruction efficiencies is problematic.  Remote sensing technologies such as 
differential absorption lidar (DIAL) can be used to estimate flare emissions and destruction 
efficiency.  Recent work with DIAL during TexAQS II indicated destruction efficiencies on an 
actual industrial flare were less than assumed for reporting purposes.  However, the use of such 
remote sensing technology is expensive and currently limited to research activities such as 
TexAQS II.  Therefore, companies must still use an assumed destruction efficiency to calculate 
VOC emissions from flares.  Most companies assume a flare destruction efficiency of 98 to 99 
percent, meaning the VOC emission rate is only one or two percent of the VOC mass rate sent to 
the flare.  These assumptions are based on a small number of controlled studies conducted in the 
early 1980s and may not represent flare operations in real-world conditions.  Furthermore, the 
chemistry that occurs within the flare flame is not well-understood in the majority of situations.  
Products of incomplete combustion may be formed and emitted from flares in addition to 

 
3-70 
uncombusted VOC from the material sent to the flares.  Some researchers have speculated that 
flares could emit formaldehyde in sufficient quantities to significantly enhance photochemical 
reactivity in the flare plumes (Castineira and Edgar, 2006; Robinson et al., 2008).  
 
To study the sensitivity of the model to potential unaccounted-for flare emissions, a model run 
was conducted in which flare emissions were increased ten-fold (10X).  This is equivalent to 
reducing assumed flare destruction efficiency from 99 percent to 90 percent.  At the same time, 
the potential source contribution function (PSCF)-based HRVOC reconciliation was removed.  
The net effect on emissions was to replace the 23.1 tpd of ground-level HRVOC emissions with 
321.6 tpd of elevated flare VOC, of which 87.9 tpd is HRVOC.

HRVOC reconciliation compares (A) modeled ETH, (B) formaldehyde (FORM), and (C) Ozone 
concentrations with observations made on the NOAA WP-3D Orion aircraft during TexAQS II, 
inside the 2 km HGB modeling grid.  In each row, the left-hand panel shows the comparison 
using the 2005-2006 base case modeling inventory, while the right-hand panel shows a similar 
comparison using the inventory with the ten-fold increase in flare VOC emissions (and 
concurrent removal of the HRVOC reconciliation discussed earlier in Section 3.4.2.1:  Point 
Sources).  The green dots represent actual data pairs.  The red dots are plotted by matching the 
smallest observed value with the smallest modeled value, then the next smallest of each, and so 
on.  The resulting QQ plot provides a means to compare the two distributions; if it lies close to 
the diagonal line, then the model is simulating the correct proportions of small, medium, and 
large concentrations of the pollutant.

The flare sensitivity markedly improves the distribution of modeled ethylene concentrations 
compared with observations and also improves modeled formaldehyde and ozone concentrations, 

 
3-72 
although the highest modeled ozone concentration remains at about 105 ppb compared with 
observations ranging to near 145 ppb.  This discrepancy is at least partly due to the 
incommensurability of the measurements:  modeled values represent averages over one hour over 
a 2 km x 2 km region (also across a vertical depth depending on model layer), while the aircraft 
measurements are essentially single points in space and time.  However, the 10X flare sensitivity 
modeling degrades performance for some pollutants at the surface, as illustrated in Figure 3-44:  
Log-Log Plots of Observed vs. Modeled Ethylene at Deer Park September 19 through October 11, 
2006; with base case inventory, and base case inventory with 10X flare emissions minus the 
HRVOC reconciliation, which compares modeled and observed ozone concentrations at Deer 
Park to base case and 10X flare emissions (note that these plots use a log-log scale; blue dots 
represent observed-modeled pairs, and red dots indicate the QQ plot).

Figure 3-45:  Daily Peak Modeled Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations with Base Case Inventory  
and 10X Flare Inventory; the difference between the two plots (Flare 10X – Reg 10) is shown at 
right shows the effect of the 10X flare VOC increase on eight-hour peak ozone concentrations on 
October 6, 2006.  The ozone plume, while still under-estimated, clearly matches the observed 
surface concentrations better with the 10X flare inventory (center) than the base case inventory 
(left).  Observed eight-hour peak ozone concentrations are shown as small circles at the monitor 
locations.

In addition to the 10X VOC sensitivity, the TCEQ ran a sensitivity in which only HRVOC 
emissions from flares were increased (also 10X).  A third sensitivity further modified the 10X 
HRVOC sensitivity to add a formaldehyde boost equal to 10 percent of the added HRVOC 
emissions.  Results of these sensitivities can be found in Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the 
HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP. 
 
More work is needed to determine whether a flare adjustment is superior to the surface-level 
reconciliation currently in use.  The TCEQ plans to investigate using a PSCF-based technique 
applied to flare emissions in the near future. 
 
Retrospective Modeling – 2000 Backcast 
The purpose of this test is to test the model in a forecast (in this case, backcast) mode, where the 
answer is known in advance.  Retrospective modeling is usually difficult to implement in practice 
because of the need to create an inventory, but a 2000 inventory was already available.  In this 
test, most of the 2006 baseline inventory was replaced with a baseline inventory previously 
developed for the 2000 ozone episode used in prior SIP revisions.  However, the episode day-
specific biogenic emissions for the 2005 and 2006 episodes were not replaced, as is also the 
practice when modeling a future base emissions inventory.  Similarly, the 2005 and 2006 
meteorology was used with the 2000 baseline emissions as is the procedure when modeling with 
the future emissions. 
 
Since the model predictions of the typical future design values are based on a DVB, which is the 
average of three regulatory design values (EPA, 2007), the quantity forecast in this test is not a 
specific future year’s design value but rather the average of three years.  Thus, the regulatory 
design values for 2000, 2001, and 2002 were averaged in the same manner as the 2006 DVB was 
calculated as the average of the 2006, 2007, and 2008 regulatory design values.  Table 3-16:  
2000 Baseline Design Value Calculation for Retrospective Analysis shows the calculation.  Only 
monitors that had at least one regulatory design value in the 2000-2002 window and also in the 
2006-2008 window were used.

Once the model was run with the 2000 baseline emissions, RRFs were calculated.  In a 
retrospective analysis, most of the RRFs are expected to be greater than 1 because ozone has 
decreased since the retrospective year.  Table 3-17:  2000 Projected DVs Compared with 
Calculated DVs shows the calculated RRFs and the respective projected 2000 design values, 
compared with those listed in Table 3-16:  2000 Baseline Design Value Calculation for 
Retrospective Analysis.

For two sites, Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 35), the projections 
were identical, or nearly identical, to the calculated baseline values.  For all other sites but one, 
the model-projected 2000 DVs were lower than the calculated values, indicating that the model 

 
3-75 
did not respond as well to emission changes as the actual airshed for these sites.  In only one case 
did the model respond notably more strongly than the airshed, Houston Monroe (CAMS 406).   
 
In conclusion, the modeled response generally was lower than the actual airshed’s response to 
2000-2006 emission changes.  This conclusion gives confidence going forward that the model’s 
predictions are conservative, and that future ozone concentrations may be even lower than 
predicted by the model. 
 
Observational Modeling – Weekday/Weekend 
Weekend emissions of NOX in urban areas tend to be lower than weekday emissions because of 
fewer miles driven.  The effect is most pronounced on weekend mornings, especially Sundays, 
since commuting is much lower than weekdays.  In a detailed analysis presented in Appendix C:  
CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP an analysis using modeled 
Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays is described, but the results were rather inconclusive 
because of small sample sizes (15 Wednesdays and 11 each Saturdays and Sundays).  A more 
comprehensive analysis was undertaken to simulate more of each day type; in three separate runs 
each day’s modeled emissions were substituted with, Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday 
emissions.  These runs provided a total of 88 each Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.   
 
For comparison, 6:00 a.m. NOX concentrations were averaged for every Wednesday, Saturday, 
and Sunday between May 15 and October 15 in the years 2005 through 2008, which gives over 
100 of each day (less for some monitors because of missing data).  Figure 3-46:  Mean Observed 
NOX Concentrations at HGB Monitors as a Percentage of Wednesday Mean Values, May 15 
through October 15, 2005 through 2008 shows observed and modeled 6:00 a.m. NOX 
concentrations at 15 sites in the HGB area.  Except for anomalous behavior at Galveston Airport 
(CAMS 34), all monitors show observed and modeled NOX concentrations that decline 
monotonically from Wednesday through Saturday to Sunday.  The observed concentrations 
(excluding Galveston Airport (CAMS 34)) show similar percentage declines, but the modeled 
values have much greater variability, with sites in eastern Harris County (near the Ship Channel) 
showing the slowest declines.  This effect could be due to the model mixing down industrial NOX 
emissions too rapidly.

filtered to remove values less than 40 ppb.  The left-hand panel of the figure shows observed

concentrations trending downward for nearly all sites, but some seem to rebound on Sunday and 
exceed the respective Saturday concentrations.  This effect is probably due to filtering 
concentrations below 40 ppb, which removes very low concentrations from the average.

While the modeled concentrations are very tightly clustered in the figure, they universally decline 
from Wednesday through Saturday to Sunday, similar to the pattern shown by the observations 
(ignoring the anomalous rebound effect).  The airshed and model both show sensitivity to NOX 
reductions, at least for days with some ozone-forming potential.  In fact, the airshed seems to 
show greater sensitivity to NOX than the model, which suggests that anticipated reductions to 
motor vehicle emissions over the next several years may be more effective than suggested by the 
model. 
 
3.6  BASELINE (2006) AND FUTURE CASE (2018) MODELING  
3.6.1  2006 Baseline Modeling 
The TCEQ selected 2006 as the baseline year for conducting the attainment modeling.  Two 
features of the 2006 baseline year are used in the attainment modeling.  First, the 2006 baseline 
year identifies the three consecutive years (2006, 2007, and 2008) with design values (DVs) that 
include the fourth high of the 2006 baseline year.  These three DVs are averaged to calculate the 
baseline design value (DVB), as previously illustrated in Figure 3-1:  Baseline Design Value 
Calculation Illustration.  Second, typical 2006 ozone season day (OSD) emissions were 
developed, as previously summarized in Table 3-13:  Summary of 2006 Baseline and 2018 Future 
Base, and 2018 Control Strategy Anthropogenic Modeling Emissions for HGB.   
 
The typical 2006 OSD emissions were modeled for all episode days to calculate the denominator 
of the RRF for each of the regulatory monitors.  The denominator of the RRF is the average of the 
modeled maximum daily eight-hour ozone concentrations for those days with modeled 
concentrations greater than or equal to 85 ppb, within a grid cell array about each monitor.   
 
Figure 3-48:  Near Monitoring Site Grid Cell Array Size shows a map of the 2 km subdomain 
nested in a portion of the 4 km x 4 km fine grid domain depicting the monitors, and the extent of 
7 x 7, 5 x 5, and 3 x 3 grid cell arrays based on the 2 km grid.  The TCEQ has calculated RRF 
values for each of these array sizes, but used a 7 x 7 grid array about each monitor.  
 

 
3-77 
 
Figure 3-48:  Near Monitoring Site Grid Cell Array Size 
 
The monitor-specific denominator of the RRF is calculated as the average of the modeled daily 
maximum eight-hour ozone concentrations above 84 ppb at that monitor.  Per the EPA’s 
modeling guidance, if there are fewer than 10 days with 2006 baseline modeled concentrations 
greater than 84 ppb, then days with modeled concentrations less than or equal to 84 ppb can be 
used so the average is based on at least 10 days.  Table 3-18:  2006 DVB, RRF Denominator 
(RRFD), and Number of 2006 Baseline Modeled Days Averaged summarizes the DVB and the 
denominator of the RRF for the HGB regulatory monitors.  There is also one non-regulatory 
monitor, Wallisville Road (CAMS 617), which has a DVB greater than or equal to 85 ppb.  
Including non-regulatory monitors that have a DVB and a RRF denominator greater than or equal 
to 85 ppb mitigates the need to conduct an unmonitored area analysis for the area represented by 
the monitor, as required by the EPA’s modeling guidance.

3.6.2  Future Baseline Modeling 
Similar to the 2006 baseline modeling, the 2018 modeling was conducted for each of the episode 
days using the projected 2018 ozone season day emissions, as previously summarized in Table 3-
13:  Summary of 2006 Baseline and 2018 Future Base, and 2018 Control Strategy Anthropogenic 
Modeling Emissions for HGB.  Using the same days as used in the 2006 baseline modeling to 
calculate the RRFD, an RRF numerator (RRFN) was calculated as the average of the of the 2018 
modeled maximum daily eight-hour ozone concentrations within the 7 x 7 grid cell array about 
each monitor.  The RRF at each monitor was calculated as the quotient of the RRFN and RRFD, 
and the 2018 future design value (DVF) at each monitor was estimated as per EPA’s modeling 
guidance, by the multiplying the 2006 DVB by the RRF.  Table 3-19:  Summary of 2006 Baseline 
Modeling, RRF, and Future Design Values summarizes the 2006 DVB, RRF and 2018 DVF at 
each of the regulatory monitors as well as the Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor (non-
regulatory monitor).

The 2018 baseline attainment modeling projects two regulatory monitors (Houston Bayland Park 
(CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 35)) and one non-regulatory monitor (Wallisville Road 
(CAMS 617)) to have DVFs greater than 84 ppb. 
 
3.6.2.1  Matrix Modeling 
A series of modeling sensitivities using across-the-board percentage reductions to the 2018 
baseline modeling emissions from sources in the eight-county HGB area was conducted.  The 
results of the modeling were used to estimate the amount of NOX and/or VOC emissions 
reduction needed to reduce the DVFs for each of the three monitors to 85 ppb.  Figure 3-49:  DVF 
versus NOX and/or VOC Emissions Reduction Response Curves for the BAYP, DRPK, and WALV 
Monitors graphically shows the response of the DVFs for the Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53), 
Deer Park (CAMS 35), and WALV (non-regulatory monitor) monitors to reductions in emissions 
of NOX and/or VOC from sources in the eight-county HGB area.

3.6.2.2  Modeling Sensitivities:  Emissions Reductions within 100 and 200 km of HGB 
Since the EPA allows NOX and VOC reduction credit for reasonable further progress within 200 
km and 100 km of a nonattainment area, respectively, emissions reduction modeling sensitivities 
were conducted for selected point sources of NOX and area sources of VOC in the 200 km 
adjacent to the eight-county HGB area.  Figure 3-50:  Map of Counties within 100 km (Red) and 
200 km (Orange) of the Eight-County HGB Area displays a map of the counties within 100 km 
and 200 km of the HGB area.

emissions inventory.  However, the sensitivity of the HGB 2018 future design values to 
reductions of NOX and VOC emissions from these outer regions is still representative for the final 
version of the 2018 modeling. 
 
For the counties within 200 km of the eight-county HGB area, point source NOX emission 
reductions (i.e., 25 and 50 percent) were made to selected Texas non-ARD sources including 
compressor engines, boilers, and process heaters.  Compressor engines account for approximately 
47 tpd of the estimated 124 tpd of NOX emissions from the selected sources in the 2018 baseline 
modeling emissions.  In addition, in a separate modeling run, a 50 percent NOX emissions 
reduction was made to 
s
County HGB Area).  Compressor engines in the eastern segment account for approximately 11 
tpd of the estimated 64 tpd of NOX emissions from the selected sources in the 2018 baseline 
modeling emissions.   
 
Table 3-21:  200 km NOX Reduction Modeling Sensitivity summarizes the sensitivity of the 
projected DVFs for the Deer Park (CAMS 35), Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53), and 
Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) (non-regulatory) monitors to NOX emissions reduction from the

3.6.2.3  Ozone Source Apportionment Tool and Anthropogenic Precursor Culpability Analysis 
The TCEQ applied the OSAT and APCA CAMx tools to the 2018 baseline modeling.  For both 
types of analyses, emission source groups, for example, on-road mobile, non- and off-road mobile, 
and biogenics, and source regions, HGB and non-HGB, are defined.  OSAT keeps track of the 
origin of the NOX and VOC precursors creating the ozone, and ozone can then be apportioned to 
pecific sources groups and regions.  APCA is similar to OSAT, but it recognizes that certain 
f every episode for 
e Houston Bayland Park (BAYP; CAMS 53), Deer Park (DRPK; CAMS 35) and Wallisville 
isodes for these three monitors are included in 
Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.   
 
Table 3-23:  OSAT/APCA Source Groups and Regions Defined lists all of the source groups and 
regions tracked in the OSAT and APCA analyses. 
s
sources groups, such as biogenics, are not controllable.  Where OSAT would apportion ozone 
production to biogenic emissions, APCA reallocates that ozone production to the controllable or 
anthropogenic emissions that combined with the biogenic emissions to create ozone. 
 
Results are plotted as layered area plots for every rolling eight-hour average o
th
Road (WALV; CAMS 617) (non-regulatory) monitors.  Results of one episode of the six modeled 
are presented here as an example.  Plots for all ep

Figures 3-51:  OSAT and APCA Results for BAYP, 3-52:  OSAT and APCA Results for DRPK, 
and 3-53:  OSAT and APCA Results for WALV show the results of these analyses for Houston 
Bayland Park (CAMS 53), Deer Park (CAMS 35), and Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) (non-
regulatory monitor), respectively.  The layer corresponding to the initial model conditions 
disappears after the first few days of the episode are modeled, as expected.  Layers corresponding 
to boundary conditions give an indication of wind direction on individual episode days and 
concentrations of ozone attributable to that boundary.   
 
Layers that correspond to HGB emission sources indicate HGB contribution to the total modeled 
ozone concentration.  The other layers, Biogenics, Other, Initial and Boundary Conditions, and 
Non-HGB Elevated Points, indicate non-HGB contributions to ozone concentration.  Differences 
between the depth of the biogenic layers between the OSAT and APCA plots indicate how ozone 
of biogenic origin is reallocated to anthropogenic sources in APCA. 
 
Lower-level local emission sources, including non-road mobile, area, on-road mobile, and low-
level points, make a greater contribution to ozone at Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) than Deer 
Park (CAMS 35), although Ship Channel sources make a noticeable contribution at Houston 
Bayland Park (CAMS 53).  Conversely, local elevated sources, including HGB elevated points, 
ships, HECT, and MECT, make a greater contribution at Deer Park (CAMS 35) than Houston 
Bayland Park (CAMS 53).  Wallisville ozone origins are more like Deer Park (CAMS 35) than 
Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53).

3.6.3  Future Case Modeling with Controls 
Proposed controls include lowering the total point source HRVOC emissions allocated by the 
HECT rule in Harris County and voluntary emission reductions of NOX and VOC from on- and 
non-road mobile sources within the eight-county HGB area. 
 
3.6.3.1  25 Percent HECT Cap Reduction 
The modeling sensitivity for the HECT rule revision reduced current total allocated point source 
HRVOC emissions by 25 percent, 2.69 tpd.  Table 3-24:  HECT Modeling Sensitivity Results 
shows the DVFs at the Deer Park (CAMS 35), Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53), and Wallisville 
Road (CAMS 617) (non-regulatory) monitors for the baseline as well as those resulting from a 25 
percent reduction in the HRVOC from HECT applicable sources in Harris County.

3.6.3.2  VMEP Reductions  
Up to 3 percent of the estimated emissions needed for attainment (i.e., 75.2 tpd NOX at Deer Park 
(CAMS 35) as shown in Table 3-20:  VOC, NOX and VOC+NOX Emissions Reductions Needed to 
Model Attainment) can be obtained from voluntary control measures.  The Houston-Galveston 
Area Council (H-GAC; http://www.h-gac.com/taq/) has estimated that approximately 2.25 tpd of 
NOX emissions reductions from on-road (1.55 tpd) and non-road (0.70 tpd) mobile sources will 
result from the application of VMEPs, including alternative commuting, regional traffic flow and 
vehicle retrofit and replacement, as well as non-road equipment measures.  The modeling 
sensitivity for VMEP was coupled with the HECT modeling sensitivity.  Table 3-25:  HECT and 
VMEP Modeling Sensitivity Results shows the DVFs at the Deer Park (CAMS 35), Houston 
Bayland Park (CAMS 53), and Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) (non-regulatory) monitors for the 
baseline as well as those resulting from both a 25 percent reduction in the HECT cap and a 2.25 
(1.55 on-road and 0.70 non-road) tpd VMEP reduction.

Nonattainment Area 
4.1  INTRODUCTION 
The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) nonattainment area for the 1997 eight-hour ozone National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), which consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, 
Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties, includes one of the most 
comprehensively controlled industrial complexes in the world.  The Texas Commission on 
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has developed stringent and innovative regulations that address 
nitrogen oxides (NOX), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and highly reactive volatile organic 
compounds (HRVOC).  Despite the significant decreases in ozone design values and emissions of 
ozone precursors in the HGB area, further reductions are necessary to bring the area into attainment 
of the 1997 eight-hour standard.  This chapter describes existing and proposed ozone control 
measures for the HGB area, as well as how Texas meets the following severe ozone nonattainment 
area state implementation plan (SIP) requirements: reasonably available control technology (RACT),

4.3  UPDATES TO EXISTING MEASURES

The MECT program in 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 101 is a market-based

specifications under 30 TAC Chapter 117, while establishing a mandatory cap for total NOX 
emissions from affected source categories in the HGB ozone nonattainment area.  The MECT 
program was adopted as a primary control measure of the HGB attainment demonstration for the one-
hour NAAQS for ozone. 
 
The proposed revisi
nonattainment area cap by prohibit
he issuance of allowance allocations to major sources that did 
not submit the required Level of Activity Certification forms by the compliance date in 30 TAC  
§ 101.360.  This proposed rule change would not reduce the current NOX cap in the HGB 
nonattainment area. 
 
The MECT program allocated NOX emission allowances to applicable existing facilities in the HGB 
area based on their 1997 to 1999 levels of activity.  The program also prov
allocating allowances to facilities that had submitted administratively complete permit applications 
before January 2, 2001.  After January 2, 2001, any applicable new or modified facilities in the HGB 
area must acquire allowances equal to their annual NOX emissions (one NOX ton per year equals one 
annual allowance) from existing facilities already participating in the program. 
 
The current rule does not prohibit the issuance of new allowances to existing applicable facilities that 
failed to previously participate in the MECT program; therefore, an increase of the total NOX cap in 
the HGB ozone nonattainment area may occur in certain circumsta
The proposed rulemaking would prohibit these potential future increases in the MECT program NOX 
cap for maintenance of the HGB one-hour ozone attainment demonstration. Additionally, maintaining

The proposed rulemaking would maintain the NOX cap integrity 
eliminate the future allocation, after the effective date of the rule, of additional allowances to 
pplicable facilities that failed to previously participate in the MECT program and previously 
itted facilities that have failed to submit t
applicable deadlines.  These facilities include: 
• 
new and modified facilities not in operation prior to January 1, 1997, but were included in 
a submitted New Construction or Modification Permit determined to be administratively 
complete before January 2, 2001; and  
• 
new and modified facilities not in operation prior to January 1, 1997, but qualified for a 
Permit by Rule and had commenced construction before January 2, 2001.   
 
This proposed rulemaking would also revise Chapter 101, Subchapter H, Division 3, to clarify the 
definition of “uncontrolled design capacity” as it relates to applicability of this division.  The TCEQ 
has received comments from stakeholders requesting clarification of the MECT program 
applicability, specifically relating to uncontrolled designed capacity and how it differs from a 
facility’s potential to emit.  The definition of “uncontrolled design capacity” would also be revised to 
allow owners or operators of emergency back-up engines at minor sources an alternative to using 
8,760 hours to calculate the uncontrolled designed capacity to emit for the engines.  Emergency back-
up engines at minor sites are typically authorized by Permit-by-Rul
le
the uncontrolled designed capacity would more accura
engine while avoiding potentially making many minor sites needlessly subject to the MECT program 
solely because the engine is no longer exempt under Chapter 117.  Because these sites would still be 
subject to the Chapter 117 minor source rules in Subchapter D, Division 1, this proposed change does 
not constitute backsliding under the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA). 
 
4.3.2  Repeal of State Portable Fuel Container Rule 
The EPA adopted a federal portable fuel container (PFC) rule in the February 26, 2007, issue of the 
Federal Register (72 FR 8432) that set a national standard for gasoline, diesel, and kerosene PFCs.  
The rule requires all PFCs manufactured on or after January 1, 2009, to comply with the federal 
standards.  The new federal PFC regulations are consistent with the revised PFC regulations adopted 
by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on
re
PFC testing methods adopted by CARB in 2001.  Therefore, the state is proposing to repeal its PFC 
regulations (rule project number 2008-032-115-EN) and to rely on the implementation of the federal 
PFC regulations to control VOC emissions from PFCs used within the state.  According to an EPA 
analysis entitled, Federal Register Rule vs. Texas Register Rule Portable Fuel C
P
 
The repeal of the current Texas PFC regulations and reliance on the new federal PFC standards will 
not have a negative impact on the Texas SIP.  The estimated emission reductions applicable to the 
implementation of the federal PFC rule in Texas are expected to be equivalent to the current Texas 
PFC rule in the early years and to provide greater reductions in the later years. 
 
4.3.3  Cl
P
nonattainment areas with 1980 populations greater than 250,000 that are classified as serious or above 
for ozone.  In accordance with this requirement, a CFFP was instituted by rule in the HGB area 
beginning on September 1, 1998.  The CFFP requires that a certain percentage of fleet purchases after 
model year 1998 be Clean Fuel Vehicles (CFV) that meet the standards set forth in § 243 of the 
FCAA. 
 

 
The most recent federal standards
4-6 
 for both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles have eclipsed the CFV 
tandards because subsequent to September 1, 2005, any new vehicle purchase ranging from 0-26,000 
ill accomplish equal long-term reductions attributable 
 the CFFP.  However, the EPA has not provided guidance on how states are to address the Clean 
t federal 
le purchases subsequent to the date of repeal would meet more stringent 
 the eight-hour ozone standard, the HGB area is required to meet the mandates of the 
CAA under §§ 172(c)(1), 182(b)(2), and 182(f).  According to the EPA’s Final Rule to Implement 
 available control technology (BACT) levels 
xpected of new sources or to maximum achievable control technology (MACT) levels required for 
s
pounds gross vehicle weight rating would have either equaled or, in most cases, exceeded CFV 
standards.  In a letter to manufacturers (EPA, 2005), the EPA stated that “subsequent to publishing its 
CFV regulations, EPA has promulgated new emission standards that are generally more stringent than 
or equivalent to the CFV emission standards for light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty 
engines.”  This EPA letter, dated July 21, 2005, applied to fleet purchases that began with the 2006 
model year (September 1, 2005). 
 
During the 79th Texas Legislature Regular Session in 2005, Senate Bill 1032 was signed into law, 
which repealed the Texas Clean Fleet Program in its entirety because the federal standards already in 
place at that time eclipsed the CFV standards referenced in the FCAA.  On April 26, 2006, the TCEQ 
formally repealed the Texas Clean Fleet Program because no additional benefit could be achieved 
from new vehicle purchases under CFFP.  A revision to the SIP that reflected the repeal of the Texas 
Clean Fleet Program was submitted to the EPA on May 15, 2006.  EPA approval of measures that 
substitute for the initial requirement to implement CFFP is provided for in § 182(c)(4) of the FCAA 
as long as the EPA determines the substitute w
to
Fuel Fleet substitution requirement in their SIP submittals, in light of the more stringen
standards.  Since new vehic
federal emission standards, cancellation of the Texas Clean Fleet Program does not necessitate action 
to substitute this program with a separate emission reduction measure containing equivalent benefits.  
Such a substitution would only be warranted when a net increase in emissions would occur due to 
repeal or cancellation of an existing program. 
 
4.4  REASONABLY AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RACT) ANALYSIS 
4.4.1  General Discussion 
The HGB area is currently classified as a severe nonattainment area for the 1997 eight-hour ozone 
NAAQS.  Under
F
the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS (40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 51.912), states 
containing areas classified as moderate nonattainment or higher must submit a SIP revision 
demonstrating that their current rules fulfill the RACT requirements for all Control Technique 
Guidelines (CTG) categories and all non-CTG major sources of NOX and VOC.  The major source 
threshold for severe nonattainment areas is a potential to emit 25 tons per year (tpy) or more of either 
NOX or VOC.   
 
In the September 17, 1979, issue of the Federal Register (44 FR 53762) RACT is defined as the 
lowest emissions limitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of control 
technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility.  RACT 
requirements for nonattainment areas classified as moderate and higher are included in the FCAA to 
assure that significant source categories at major sources of ozone precursor emissions are controlled 
to a reasonable extent, but not necessarily to best
e
major sources of hazardous air pollutants.  While RACT and RACM have similar consideration 
factors like technological and economic feasibility, there is a significant distinction between RACT 
and RACM.  To be considered RACM, a control measure must advance attainment of the area 
towards meeting the NAAQS for that measure (see § 172(c)(1) of the FCAA).  Advancing attainment 
of the area is not a factor of consideration when evaluating RACT because the benefit of 
implementing RACT is presumed under the FCAA.   
 
Under the current state rules, the HGB area is subject to some of the most stringent NOX and VOC 
emission control requirements in the country, and for many source categories, the existing rules are

The EPA issued 11 Consumer and Commercial Products CTG documents between 2006 and 2008

of the new CTG recommendations are updates to previously issued CTG documents and some are 
recommendations for new categories.  The TCEQ evaluated these new CTG documents in this RACT

TAC Chapter 115 and NOX rules in Chapter 117 were previously determined to meet the FCAA 
RACT requirements.  Under the one-hour ozone NAAQS, the HGB area was also designated as a 
“severe” nonattainment area and the threshold for major stationary sources under the one-hour ozone 
nonattainment designation was identical to the current threshold under the eight-hour ozone 
designation.  Therefore, controls to satisfy RACT for most major sources under the eight-hour ozone 
designation were implemented by the TCEQ under

the FCAA requirements for NOX RACT.  The MECT program and accompanying Chapter 117 rules 
represent one of the most comprehensive NOX control strategies in the nation and encompass both 
RACT and beyond-RACT levels of control.  Except for the EPA's Glass Furnace ACT document, the 
current EPA-approved Chapter 117 rules fulfill RACT requirements for all CTG and ACT NOX 
source categories.  For non-CTG/ACT major NOX emission source categories, RACT is fulfilled by 
the MECT program or by separate source-specific rules in Chapter 117 for sources that NOX controls

The TCEQ provides a negative declaration for the Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Assembly

4.4.3.2  CTG Documents That Do Not Represent RACT for the HGB Area 
For the following three CTG documents, the TCEQ determined that the CTG recommendations either 
do not represent RACT due to economic or technological feasibility concerns or that the current 
Chapter 115 rules are equivalent or superior to the CTG-recommended controls: Fiberglass Boat 
Manufacturing Materials; Flexible Packaging Printing Materials; and Paper, Film, and Foil Coatings.  
Therefore, the TCEQ is not implementing any rule amendments or new rules associated with these 
TG categories.

4.4.3.3  CTG Documents That a RACT Determination Cannot Be Made at This Time 
The TCEQ is not making a determination at this time whether the Industrial Cleaning Solvents or the 
Miscellaneous Industrial Adhesives CTG recommendations represent RACT for Texas.  The TCEQ's 
initial assessment indicates that the EPA substantially underestimated the scope and potential impact 
of the CTG recommendations and that implementing the CTG recommendations would have 
widespread and potentially adverse impacts to small businesses and micro-businesses.  The TCEQ 
will continue to evaluate these CTG documents and plans to provide small business outreach to 
engage stakeholders that could be potentially impacted by the EPA's suggested control measures.  A 
RACT determination for these CTG categories will be made after adequate stakeholder input and the 
TCEQ has determined the impact to small businesses, economic and technological feasibility, and 
ractical enforceability of the CTG recommendations. 
p
 
By letter dated December 8, 2008, the TCEQ requested clarification from the EPA regarding several 
issues related to the following three CTG documents: Large Appliance Coatings; Metal Furniture 
Coatings; and Miscellaneous Metal and Plastic Parts Coatings.  A number of the recommended VOC 
content limits for specific coatings categories in the CTG documents are less stringent than the more 
general VOC content limits specified in the EPA's original CTG recommendations.  The TCEQ 
requested clarification to assure that implementing the CTG recommendations would not be 
considered as backsliding and to be certain that the TCEQ has the appropriate information to 
determine whether the CTG recommendations actually represent RACT for Texas.  As of September 
4, 2009, the EPA has not responded to the TCEQ request for clarification on the CTG 
recommendations.  Therefore, the TCEQ is not making a determination at this time whether these 
CTG recommendations represent RACT for Texas until the EPA provides clarification to the issues

4.4.3.4  CTG Documents That Represent RACT for the HGB Area 
The TCEQ has determined that portions of the Offset Lithographic and Letterpress Printing CTG 
recommendations represent RACT for the HGB area.  Concurrent with this SIP revision, the TCEQ is 
proposing rulemaking to limit the VOC content of solvents used by offset lithographic printing 
facilities in the HGB area (Rule Project 2008-019-115-EN).  The proposed rulemaking would 
implement the CTG recommendations to reduce the VOC content of the fountain solutions and 
cleaning materials.  Additionally, the proposed rulemaking would expand the current rule 
applicability to include smaller sources not currently subject to the rule.  The TCEQ is not 
implementing any rule amendments or new rules associated with the CTG-recommended control 
requirements for heatset presses or with the letterpress printing portion of this CTG document for the 
GB area.  Additional discussion concerning the TCEQ's determination regarding the CTG

4.5  REASONABLY AVAILABLE CONTROL MEASURES ANALYSIS 
4.5.1  General Discussion 
States are required by § 172(c)(1) of the FCAA to “provide for implementation of all reasonably 
available control measures as expeditiously as practicable” and to include RACM analyses in the SIP.  
In the General Preamble for implementation of the FCAA Amendments of 1990 published in the 
April 16, 1992, issue of the Federal Register (57 FR 13498), the EPA explains that it interprets  
§ 172(c)(1) of the FC
a
obligated to adopt only those measures that are reasonably available for implementation in light of 
local circumstances.   
 
The TCEQ used a two-step process to identify potential control strategies for the HGB area RACM 
analysis.  The TCEQ compiled a list of potential control strategy concepts based on an initial 
evaluation of the existing control strategies and existing sources of VOC and NOX in the HGB area.  
Stationary sources outside the HGB area within either a 100 kilometer (km) or 200 km range of the 
HGB area were also considered for this initial evaluation. According to the EPA's guidance, sources 
of VOC must be within 100 km of the nonattainment area and sources of NOX must be within 200 
km.  The EPA allows states the option of considering control measures outside the ozone 
nonattainment area that can be shown to advance attainment; however, consideration of these sources 
is not a requirement of the FCAA.  Draft lists of potential control strategy concepts for stationary and 
mobile sources were developed from this initial evaluation.  The draft lists of potential control 
strategy concepts were presented to stakeholders for comment at stakeholder meetings held in the 
HGB area on March 25 and 26, 2008.  The TCEQ requested comment on the potential control 
strategies and invited stakeholders to suggest any additional strategies that might help advance 
attainment of the HGB area.  The final lists of

Each potential control measure identified through the control strategy development process was

4.5.2  Results of RACM Analysis 
Based on the RACM analysis, the TCEQ determined that only one potential control measure met the 
criteria to be considered RACM.  A reduction in the HRVOC cap for Harris County under the HECT 
program was determined to help advance attainment of the HGB area and to meet the other RACM 
criteria.  Reported HRVOC emissions from sources in the HECT program during the first two years 
of the HECT program, calendar years 2007 and 2008, averaged approximately 56 percent of the total 
allocated HRVOC allowances for Harris County.  Because there is a demonstrated substantial surplus 
in the HRVOC cap, a 25 percent reduction in the cap for Harris County is technologically feasible 
and should have minimal economic impact.  Modeling demonstrates that a 25 percent reduction in the 
HRVOC cap for Harris County will help the HGB area make progress toward attainment of the 1997 
eight-hour ozone NAAQS.  Based on 2007-2008 emissions, a 25 percent reduction would leave a 
buffer of approximately 600 tpy, or more, in the cap that should be sufficient to account for any 
significant variations in HRVOC emissions in future years due to emission events and scheduled 
startup, shutdown, and maintenance events as well as allow for future economic growth.  Additional

The proposed revisions to the HECT Program Cap rule would result in a 25 percent reduction in the

Photochemical modeling analysis demonstrates that a 25 percent reduction of the HECT cap on the 
total Harris County HRVOC allocation would advance attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone 
NAAQS by reducing the future 2018 ozone design values (DV18s) at all HGB monitors.  Future 
design value calculations were based on 2006.  The largest decrease in the projected DV18s (0.24 ppb) 
was at the Deer Park monitor.  The average decrease for all sites was 0.11 ppb.  The three HGB 
monitors projected to be exceeding the eight-hour ozone NAAQS (i.e., DV18 > 84 ppb) in the 2018 
future case modeling, also exceed in the HECT sensitivity modeling.  The Wallisville monitor has the 
highest predicted DV18 (88.3 ppb) in the 2018 future case modeling, and continues to be the highest in 
the HECT sensitivity modeling (88.1 ppb)

HRVOC data from the first two years indicates that the total reported actual emissions from sources 
in the HECT program are approximately 50 percent of the total HRVOC cap.  Because the HRVOC 
rules in Chapter 115, Subchapter H, Divisions 1 and 2, require emissions from startup, shutdown, and 
maintenance activities be included in the HECT program, the total surplus observed in the first two 
years of the program cannot be removed.  Proposing a 25 percent reduction leaves a buffer in the cap

Following the initial allocation of allowances, companies participating in the HECT program

The rule revision proposes a new allocation methodology beginning with the 2011 calendar-year

proposed revised allocation methodology is based on calculating “uncontrolled” or “precontrolled” 
emissions for facilities using reported control efficiencies based on the specifications for flares in 
Chapter 115; creating a 250 ton emission event set aside pool to encourage market trading; and

4.6.2  Local Programs 
The H-GAC worked with HGB area local governments and business stakeholders to develop 
appropriate control strategies to meet the SIP requirements and to recruit stakeholders who would 
take legal responsibility for implementing these strategies through the establishment of memoranda of 
agreement.  As a result, six projects were identified as Transportation Control Measures (TCMs), and 
numerous strategies were agreed upon with local governments as voluntary measures.  For more

4.6.2.1  Transportation Control Measures 
TCMs are transportation projects and related activities that are designed to reduce on-road mobile 
source emissions and are included as control measures in the SIP.  Allowable types of TCMs are 
listed in § 7408 (Air Quality Criteria and Control Techniques) of the FCAA, and defined in the 
federal transportation conformity rule found in 40 CFR, Part 93 (Determining Conformity of Federal 
Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans).  The federal transportation conformity rule 
requires that timely implementation of TCMs be demonstrated.  In general, TCMs are transportation 
related projects that attempt to reduce vehicle use, change traffic flow, or reduce congestion 
conditions.  Projects that add single-occupancy-vehicle roadway capacity or are based on 
provements in vehicle technology or fuels are not considered to be TCMs.

The H-GAC has identified TCMs that have been or will be implemented in the nonattainment area.  
By the start of the 2018 ozone season, these TCMs will reduce NOX emissions in the HGB area by

Historically, federal mobile source control strategies have focused primarily on reducing emissions 
per mile through vehicle and fuel technology improvements.  Tremendous strides have been made 
resulting in new light-duty vehicle emission standards that are 70 to 90 percent less than that for the 
1970 model year.  However, mobile sources continue to constitute a significant portion of ozone 
precursor emissions in the HGB area due to population and employment growth as well as an increase 
in daily vehicle miles traveled per person.  Therefore, mobile source strategies that attempt to

A number of voluntary mobile source and transportation programs have already been initiated at the

The H-GAC identified three voluntary measures that will aid in the improvement of the HGB region’s 
air quality.  These measures were identified through a contract between H-GAC and ENVIRON 
International Corporation.  Nineteen meetings were held with stakeholders from the region to solicit 
comments and suggestions for voluntary programs.  The H-GAC’s commitment for NOX from VMEP 
is 2.25 tpd.  The H-GAC, as the regional metropolitan transportation planning agency for the HGB 
area, has committed to make a good faith effort to implement the projects and/or programs outlined in 
this document and will be responsible for monitoring and reporting the emission reductions to the 
TCEQ.  More information on each of the VMEP commitments can be found in Appendix H:

4.7  Motor Vehicle Emissions Budget (MVEB) 
The MVEB refers to the maximum allowable emissions from on-road mobile sources for each

transportation conformity analyses.  Areas must demonstrate that the estimated emissions from 
transportation plans, programs, and projects do not exceed the MVEB.  The attainment budget

demonstration.  The budget reflects all of the on-road control measures reflected in that

4.8  MONITORING NETWORK 
States are required by 40 CFR, Part 58, Subpart B, to submit an annual monitoring network review to 
the EPA by July 1 of each year.  This network review is required to provide the framework for 
establishment and maintenance of an air quality surveillance system.  The annual monitoring network 
review must be made available for public inspection for at least 30 days prior to submission to the 
EPA.  The review, and any comments received during the 30 day inspection period, are then 
forwarded to the EPA for final review and approval.  The TCEQ posted this plan from June 1 through 
June 30, 2009.  The document presented the current Texas network of ambient air Photochemical 
Assessment Monitoring Station (PAMS) monitors as well as proposed changes to the network from 
uly 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010.

sampling at the Clinton PAMS Type 2 Site (AQS ID 48-201-1035) each year.  As agreed upon with 
the EPA, Region 6, the TCEQ will collect a total of 240 carbonyl samples at this site at a sampling 
frequency of eight 3-hour samples per day every three days during July-September.  Carbonyl 
sampling will be terminated at the Houston Channelview site to offset this increased sampling

4.9  CONTINGENCY PLAN 
SIP revisions for nonattainment areas are required by § 172(c)(9) of the FCAA to provide for specific 
measures to be implemented should a nonattainment area fail to meet reasonable further progress 
(RFP) requirements or attain the applicable NAAQS by the attainment date set by the EPA.  These 
contingency measures are to be implemented without further action by the state or the EPA.  In the 

 
General Preamble for implementation of the FCAA Amendments of 1990 published in the April 16, 
1992, issue of the Federal Register (57 FR 13498), the EPA interprets the contingency requirement to 
mean additional emissions reductions that are sufficient to equal up to 3 percent of the e
4-14 
missions in 
e adjusted base year inventory.  These emissions reductions should be realized in the year following 
our Ozone Nonattainment Area Reasonable Further Progress

The adjusted base year emissions inventory is used in the RFP planning process to calculate required 
emissions reduction targets and excludes certain on-road mobile source emissions reductions from 
controls that were promulgated prior to the 1990 amendments to the FCAA.  This 1997 eight-hour 
ozone attainment demonstration SIP revision also uses the adjusted base year inventory as the 
inventory from which to calculate the required 3 percent reduction for contingency.  For further 
information regarding the adjusted base year inventory for the HGB area and how the area meets RFP 
requirements, see the HGB 1997 Eight-H
S
attainment demonstration SIP revision.   
 
A summary of the 2019 contingency analysis is provided in Table 4-3:  2019 Contingency 
Demonstration for the HGB Area.  Consistent with the EPA’s NOX substitution guidance, the 3 
percent attainment demonstration contingency analysis for 2019 is based on a 2 percent reduction in 
NOX emissions (17.16 tpd) and a 1 percent reduction in VOC emissions (9.36 tpd) to be achieved 
between 2018 and 2019 (EPA, 1993).  Inventory analyses were performed on the fleet turnover 
effects for the federal emission certification programs for on-road and non-road vehicles.  The 
emission reductions from 2018 to 2019 were estimated for these programs.  For a detailed description 
of the contingency reductions, see Appendix 1:  HGB Reasona

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPArs proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal-fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean 'Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global-warming
emissions and to make sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to continue polluting with global-warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong
rul~s in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth,
creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
I live here,
and I
would like to continue breathing, but allowing coal
fired plants in TX will have a huge,
negative impact on all people,
especially those with upper respiratory problems.
Stop this insanity,
now!

My thoughts:
Many of us in Texas would rather see the economy take a sharp turn
toward clean energy,
toward wind and solar power,
even geothermal and
wave power.
We can do all that in this large,
diverse state.
Traditionally, this has been the state that's easy to do
Ilbidness ll in. Unfortunately, this coal business is not good
for our health,
and is degrading the atmosphere to the point that it
makes moot any debate about its effects on our children1s health. It
will certainly be challenged by climate change and fossil fuel-produced
air pollution.
Please help bring Texas into the 21st Century by stopping the
easy-going permitting of coal plants in what could be a beautiful

Re: Comments on Docket No.EPA-R06-0AR-2006-TX-0133
Dear Mr. Spruiell:
The Texas Oil & Gas Association (""TxOGA"") is the largest
and oldest petroleum organization in Texas, representing over
4,000 members. The membership of TxOGA produces in excess
of 90 percent of Texas' crude oil and natural gas, operates nearly
100 percent of the state's refining capacity, and is responsible for
the vast majority of the state's pipelines. According to the most
recent data, the oil and gas industry employs 189,000 Texans,
providing payroll and benefits of over $24 billion in Texas alone.
In addition, large associated capital investments by the oil and
gas industry generates significant secondary economic benefits
for Texas.
TxOGA strongly supports the ongoing goal of improved air
quality and we are encouraged that the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is finally acting on these matters.
Certainty in
regulatory processes is important to existing businesses who want
to amend existing permits to expand and incorporate additional
pollution controls. Unfortunately, we do not believe the proposed
New Source Review reforms will improve our air quality and we
are concerned that it will have negative unintended consequences
and ultimately discourage future business expansions.
Attached are our specific comments relating to New Source
Review Reform by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,

TEXAS OIL & GAS ASSOCIATION COMMENTS
EPA PROPOSED NEWSOURCE REVIEW (NSR) REFORM
Docket ID No. EPA-R06-0AR-2006-TX-0133
74 Fed. Heg. 48,467 (Sept. 23, 2009)
Re-Openings
EPA states concerns that Texas Plantwide Applicability Limit (PAL) provisions do not relate to
re-openings. TxOGA responds by highlighting the current provision of 30 TAC §116.192
regarding amendments and alterations of PALs which provide adequate safeguards to ensure that
appropriate procedural requirements are followed, both to increase a PAL through an amendment
and to decrease a PAL through a permit alteration. The absence of rule language using the
specific term ""reopening"" does not prevent the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) from implementing and enforcing the program in a manner consistent with Part 51.
Monitoring
EPA asserts that Texas PAL provisions should track the federal monitoring requirements. Texas
PAL rules establish clear and specific monitoring requirements in 30 TAC §116.186(c) that are
consistent with the federal PAL monitoring requirements. The Texas requirements specify what
regulated entities must do in order to be in compliance with the rules. These monitoring
requirements are equivalent to federal requirements.
All facilities at a major stationary source
EPA also asserts that all facilities at a major stationary source should be included in the PAL.
The Texas PAL rules are substantively similar to and closely track the federal PAL regulations,
as the TCEQ explained in adopting the Texas PAL program. The similarities can be seen in 30
TAC §116.182(1), which states that an applicant must specify ""(A) list of all facilities, including
their registration or permit number to be included in the PAL, their potential to emit, and the
expected maximum capacity. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate
which, if any, federal or state applicable requirements, emission limitations, or work practices
apply to each unit.""
Definition of ""baseline actual emissions"" and ''projected annual emission"" should include
startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions
EPA has raised concern that these definitions do not require the inclusion of emissions resulting
from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. 30 TAC §1I6.12(3)(E) states that ""(t)he actual
emissions rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable. Until March 1, 2016,
emission previously demonstrated as emissions events or historically exempted under Chapter
3

I0I of this title (relating to General Air Quality Rules) may be included to the extent that they
have been authorized, or are being authorized."" These emissions include maintenance, startup,
and shutdown (MSS) emissions. The TCEQ has been working on MSS permits for refineries for
quite some time. Therefore, the term ""baseline actual emissions"" does not include emissions
resulting from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. The TCEQ is working to, among other
things, distinguish between planned and unplanned MSS emissions and authorize those planned
MSS emissions in Texas air permits. A State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision reflecting the
MSS permitting initiative has been submitted to EPA for approval.
Pollution Control Project Standard Permit
The EPA has taken issue with the TCEQ addressing site-specific determinations and the
Executive Director's discretion in making case-specific determinations in individual cases in lieu
of generic enforceable requirements. EPA also asserts that a standard permit must be limited to a
single source category. The Pollution Control Project (PCP) standard permit is also a minor
NSR permitting tool. Similar to all other minor NSR permitting programs, the state has wide
discretion in its implementation of the program. Currently, Texas rule requires that a permittee
make a submittal to the TCEQ, but does not require the Executive Director to act to approve the
submittal. The Executive Director reviews the permit based on air quality impacts and only
disallows use if air quality would be negatively impacted. The discretionary denial provision
makes the Texas PCP standard permit more stringent and environmentally sound than most.

plant in 
the works that will increase emissions in our city by 70%, even 
though 
we already have more refineries in a populated area than any 
other city 
in the United States, except for Los Angeles. Corpus 
Christi-ans and 
Texans deserve better. We cannot let coal or petroleum coke

strong 
rules in place to make sure the coal industry is held 
responsible for 
their mess and that no permits issued under TCEQ1s illegal

process are allowed to proceed forward. Strong regulations are 
vital 
to cleaning up the energy industry and putting us on a path to

Dear Mr. Spruiell:
The Association of Electric Companies ofTexas (""AECT"") appreciates
the opportunity to submit these comments regarding the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed SIP disapproval of the above-referenced
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) proposed NSR SIP rule
revisions.
AECT is an industry trade association representing electric companies in
Texas. Organized in 1978, AECT provides a forum for member companies'
representatives to exchange information on their industry, and to communicate
with state and federal governmental officials.
AECT believes that the Texas SIP, which is implemented by the TCEQ ,
meets Federal Clean Air (FCAA) requirements, and as a result, and SIP
disapproval is inappropriate. EPA's proposed disapproval has injected uncertainty
into the Texas air quality permitting program, without any promise of additional
environmental protection. Uncertainty may lead to increased costs to suppliers of
electricity, fuels, and products, which may in turn hurt economic growth, lead to
increased electricity prices for consumers across the country during a time when
consumers are in need of affordable, reliable electric generation, and negatively
impact job growth.
AECT strongly encourages EPA to work expeditiously with TCEQ to
address the remaining misunderstandings and disagreements about the proposed
TCEQ NSR SIP rule revisions, in addition to its proposed disapprovals ofthe
other TCEQ rules for which EPA has proposed disapproval, and to resolve these

issues without the need for SIP disapproval. In doing so, AECT respectfully
requests that EPA consider the following relevant points.
The Texas air quality permitting program (including the proposed NSR
SIP rule revisions), which the TCEQ implements, is one of the most
comprehensive and protective air quality permitting program s in the
country.
The Texas air quality permitting program has mandated very significant
reductions in the emissions of various pollutants, which has resulted in
industrial sources in Texas being some of the lowest emitting sources in
the country. For example, because of the Texas air quality permitting
program, electric generating units (EGUs) in Texas have already achieved
significant reductions in nitrogen oxides (NO x) and sulfur dioxide (S02)
emissions over the past several years. As a result of theses reductions,
EGUs in Texas have much lower NOx and S02emissions than EGUs in
other states. (See enclosed graphs and tables)
According to the Acid
Rain scorecard data for 2008, the average NOx and S02emissions rates (in
Ib/mmBtu) for EGUs in Texas were only about 50% of the average NOx
and S0 2emissions rates for EGUs in the rest of the country.
The significant reductions in emissions of various pollutants that have
resulted from the Texas air quality permitting program have greatly
improved the air quality in Texas, including greatly reducing the ambient
concentrations of ozone and other criteria pollutants.
The reductions in ambient concentrations ofozone and other cri teria
pollutants have occurred even though the population in Texas has grown
at a high rate.
The TCEQ-implemented Texas air quality permitting program has caused
these air quality improvements without unnecessarily negatively
impacting economic development in Texas. Indeed, Texas' economy has
continued to be one ofthe most vibrant in the country. AECT believes it
is critical that EPA does not take any steps in this SIP disapproval action
that would negatively impact Texas' economy, without providing
commensurate improvement in the air quality in Texas.
EPA's proposed SIP disapproval ofthe proposed TCEQ NSR SIP
revisions, as well as its proposed disappro vals ofthe other TCEQ rules for
which EPA has proposed disapproval, is causing, and will cause,
tremendous operational uncertainty for companies with permits that were
issued under the proposed TCEQ NSR SIP revisions, or under the other
TCEQ rules for which EPA has proposed SIP disapproval. This
uncertainty could have a chilling effect on the economy in Texas. Such

uncertainty could cause companies to be hesitant to seek to expand their
existing operations or to construct new operations, which would prevent
the critically needed jobs and the economic growth that such expanded or
new operations would create. Such uncertainty may also cause companies
to not make the changes to improve the efficiency of their processes that
are needed to allow them to compete in the national and international
markets.
In light ofthe significant air emission rule proposals currently being
considered by EPA (e.g., mercury MACT, PSD Tailoring Rule), AECT is
concerned that the uncertainty injected by the EPA' s proposed SIP
disapproval ofthe TCEQ's NSR SIP revisions, in addition to its proposed
disapprovals of the other TCEQ rules for which EPA has proposed
disapproval, may jeopardize or substantially delay the ability of electric
generators to obtain necessary air permits to install pollution controls that
will be necessary to compl y with current and future regulations
Prompt EPA approval ofthe proposed TCEQ NSR SIP revisions, as well
as the other TCEQ rules for which EPA has proposed disapproval, is
needed in order to provide the regulatory certainty necessary for economic
development, creation of critically needed jobs, and generation of
affordable, reliable electricity in Texas.
The EPA's proposed disappro val of the proposed TCEQ NSR SIP revisions, as
well as the other TCEQ rules for which EPA has proposed disapproval, could
discourage economic development, the creatio n of critically needed jobs, and the
generation of affordable, reliable electric generation for American consumers and
businesses, as well as harm members of the regulated community by forcing them
to go through additional expensive and environmentally-unnecessary permitting
processes. AECT respectfully requests that the EPA work expeditiously with
TCEQ to address the remaining misunderstandings and disagreem ents about the
NSR SIP rule revisions, and to resolve these issues without the need for SIP
disapproval.
AECT appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments.
Sincerely,
John W. Fainter, Jr.
AECT President and CEO

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ)
is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ1s current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal-fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean 'Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global-warming
emissions and to make sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to continue polluting with global-warming emissions.
As
a physician and pubic health scientist,
I
am concerned about air
quality and the ramifications of weakened enforcement of the Clean Air
Act.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than
any other state in the nation,
is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the
top of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past
five years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the
way of our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules
in place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their
mess and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process

TIP COMMENTS ON EPA PROPOSED DISAPPROVAL OF TCEQ NSR REFORM SUBMITTAL
Docket ID No. EPA–R06–OAR–2006–0133
 74 Fed. Reg. 48,467 (Sept. 23, 2009)
The Texas Industry Project (“TIP”) submits the following comments in response 
to the proposed disapproval of Texas's state implementation plan (“SIP”) submittals relating to 
New Source Review (“NSR”) reform by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and 
published in the Federal Register on September 23, 2009.  TIP is comprised of 62 companies in 
the chemical, refining, oil and gas, electronics, forest products, terminal, electric utility, and 
transportation industries with operations in Texas.1
I.
Introduction
TIP strongly supports full approval of the Texas NSR reform provisions and
definitions, including 30 TAC Chapter 116, Subchapter C regarding plant-wide applicability 
limits (“PALs”).  TIP further supports full approval of the minor NSR state pollution control 
project (“PCP”) standard permit codified at 30 TAC § 116.617.  The Texas air quality permitting 
program is stringent, comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.   
Under Texas’s integrated air permitting regime, air quality in the state is 
demonstrating strong, sustained improvement.  Between 1999 and 2005, NOX emissions in the 
Houston-Galveston area decreased from almost 1,200 tons per day, to under 600 tons per day.2  
Ozone as measured under the one-hour standard in the Houston-Galveston area has declined 
from 220 parts per billion (“ppb”) in 1991 to 127 ppb in 2009.3  Under the eight-hour standard,

ozone in the Houston-Galveston area has declined from 119 ppb in 1991, to 84 ppb in 2009.4  
Moreover, between 1988 and 2008, there has been an 80% reduction in VOC compound 
indicators in the Houston area.5  There has been a similar improvement in toxic air emissions.  
Between 2003 and 2008, there has been a 50% decrease in highly reactive volatile organic 
compounds (“HRVOCs”) in the Houston area.6  Similarly, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, ozone 
as measured under the one-hour standard declined from 140 ppb in 1991 to 115 ppb in 2009.7  
Ozone for the Dallas-Fort Worth area under the eight-hour standard has declined from 105 ppb 
in 1991 to 86 ppb in 2009.8  Notably, according to recent TCEQ review, all areas of Texas are in 
attainment for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.9
Further, the data show that stationary sources have contributed more substantial 
emissions reductions than any other category during the period of most dramatic air quality 
improvements.  In the Houston-Galveston area between 1993 and 2008, NOX emissions from 
stationary sources declined from 695 tons per day (“tpd”), to 156 tpd, a decrease of 539 tpd.10  
During that same period, emissions from on-road source declined from 416 tpd to 175 tpd, a 
decrease of 241 tpd.11  Similarly, stationary sources made significant decreases for VOC.  
Between 1993 and 2009 in the Houston-Galveston area, VOC emissions from stationary sources 
decreased from 411 tpd, to 170 tpd, a decrease of 241 tpd.12  On-road sources from that same 
period decreased from 199 tpd, to 86 tpd, a decrease of 113 tpd.13  As the figures indicate, 
stationary sources in Texas have made the most significant strides in reducing emissions.
The submitted revisions strengthen a previously SIP-approved Texas program. 
Under the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “Act”), SIP revisions are approved when those 
revisions do not interfere with the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(“NAAQS”).  States have the primary responsibility for developing plans for the attainment and 
maintenance of the NAAQS.  In fact, as the Fifth Circuit recently explained:
Although EPA is required to approve SIPs that provide for the timely 
attainment and subsequent maintenance of primary and secondary ambient 
air standards as well as satisfy other CAA general requirements, see 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(a)(3), the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a

State’s choices of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that 
otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(2).14
Rather, the proper test for determining whether a SIP revision can be approved is whether the 
revision interferes with attainment of the NAAQS (i.e. that the plan does not make air quality 
worse).15  The last ten years have seen an unprecedented improvement in Texas air quality.  The 
submitted revisions have been fully integrated components of the Texas air quality permitting 
program for all that time.  Because the current SIP submittals function to strengthen the existing 
SIP, such submittal does not raise interference concerns, and should be fully approved.
The Texas NSR rules track closely the federal NSR rules.  In instances where the 
Texas provisions depart from the exact wording of the federal rules, Texas has justified those 
departures.  The Texas NSR rules and associated rules are equivalent to the federal rules and 
should be approved.
II.
Substance of Asserted Deficiencies NSR Reform
EPA’s concerns on specific aspects of the Texas NSR reform are reproduced and 
addressed below.  Headings are for convenience only—all comments are intended to address all 
aspects of EPA’s proposal.
A.
PAL Provisions
1.
A PAL should only apply to existing sources with two years of 
operation.
EPA Comment:

“The submittal lacks a provision which limits applicability of a 
PAL only to an existing major stationary source, and which 
precludes applicability of a PAL to a new major stationary 
source.”
TIP Response:
The absence of a reference to “existing” facilities is not grounds for disapproval 
of the Texas PAL rules.  Even absent a reference to existing facilities, the Texas PAL rules are 
substantively similar to and closely track the federal PAL regulations, as the TCEQ explained in 
adopting the Texas PAL program.16  The Texas PAL rules’ applicability provisions are 
consistent with the federal PAL program in 40 CFR Part 51, and should be approved as part of 
the Texas SIP on that basis.  
Moreover, the federal scheme contemplates that “new” units may be included 
when calculating the baseline actual emissions for a PAL.  In the 2002 preamble to the NSR

reform rulemaking in which the final PAL rules were introduced, EPA explained how a PAL is 
to be determined:  “You must first identify all your existing emissions units (greater than 2 years 
of operating history) and new emissions units (less than 2 years of operating history since 
construction.)”17  The preamble goes on to provide, “For any emission unit . . . that is constructed 
after the 24-month period, emissions equal to its PTE must be added to the PAL level.”18
Additionally, EPA issued PALs before NSR reform and these PALs showed a 
degree of flexibility tailored to the specific sites.  For example, in its flexible permit pilot study, 
EPA examined a hybrid PAL issued to the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee.19  This permit 
consisted of PSD permit for a major expansion with permitted emissions based on projected 
future actual emissions in combination with a PSD permit for existing emissions units with 
allowable emissions based on current actual emissions at the existing emissions units.  According 
to EPA, that plant’s hybrid PAL permit enabled Saturn to add and modify new lines “in a timely 
manner, while ensuring that best available pollution control technologies are installed and that air 
emissions remain under approved limits.”20  
Texas’s PAL provisions are consistent with the federal PAL provisions, and so 
should be approved.  EPA concerns regarding the TCEQ’s implementation of the Texas rules are 
properly addressed through comments on individual permits, and not through a disapproval of 
the SIP revision.
2.
PAL provisions should track the federal PAL reopening 
requirements.
EPA Comment:

“The submittal has no provisions that relate to PAL re-openings, 
as required by 40 CFR 51.165(f)(8)(ii), (ii)(A) through (C), and 
51.166(w)(8)(ii) and (ii)(a).” 
TIP Response:
The current provisions of 30 TAC § 116.192 regarding amendments and 
alterations of PALs provide adequate safeguards to ensure that appropriate procedural
requirements are followed, both to increase a PAL through an amendment and to decrease a PAL 
through a permit alteration.  See, e.g., 30 TAC § 116.190(b), requiring the decrease of a PAL for 
any emissions reductions used as offsets.  The absence of rule language using the specific term 
“reopening” does not prevent the TCEQ from implementing and enforcing the program in a 
manner consistent with Part 51 and is not an appropriate basis for disapproval of the SIP 
revision.  The Texas PAL rules should be approved as a revision to the Texas SIP.

3.
PAL 
provisions 
should 
track 
the 
federal 
monitoring 
requirements.
EPA Comment:

“Nor is there a mandate that failure to use a monitoring system 
that meets the requirements of this section renders the PAL 
invalid.”
TIP Response:
EPA’s concern on this issue is not the absence of monitoring requirements in the 
rules.  It is, rather, about the absence of an explicit statement that a PAL is invalid absent 
monitoring.  This minor language issue does not rise to the level of requiring a disapproval.  
The Texas PAL rules make clear that monitoring is mandatory for a PAL.  The 
rules establish monitoring requirements in 30 TAC § 116.186(c) that are consistent with the 
federal PAL monitoring requirements.  Most importantly, the monitoring requirements are cast in 
terms of requirements that shall be met.  Examples include:

§ 116.186(c)(1):  “The PAL monitoring system must accurately determine all 
emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time.”21

§ 116.186(c)(2) further specifies requirements that shall be met for any permit holder 
using mass balance equations, continuous emissions monitoring system (“CEMS”), 
continuous parameter monitoring system (“CPMS”) predictive emissions monitoring 
system (“PEMS”), or emission factors.22
These provisions adequately address the monitoring requirements required under 
the federal PAL provisions.  Any additional statement that the PAL is rendered invalid unless the 
permit holder complies with these requirements is unnecessary in light of the clearly mandatory 
monitoring requirements that are equivalent to federal requirements.  
4.
All facilities at a major stationary source should be included in 
the PAL.
EPA Comment:

“The Texas submittal at 30 TAC 116.186 provides for an emissions 
cap that may not account for all of the emissions of a pollutant at 
the major stationary source. Texas requires the owner or operator 
to submit a list of all facilities to be included in the PAL see 30 
TAC 116.182(1), such that not all of the facilities at the entire

major stationary source may be specifically required to be 
included in the PAL.”
TIP Response:
EPA’s interpretation of the Texas PAL rules, which are consistent with the federal 
PAL, is not grounds for disapproval of the SIP revision.  The Texas PAL rules are substantively 
similar to and closely track the federal PAL regulations, as the TCEQ explained in adopting the 
Texas PAL program.  EPA concerns regarding the TCEQ’s implementation of the Texas rules 
are properly addressed through comments on individual permits and not through a disapproval of 
the SIP revision.
The Texas rules require that applicants for a PAL specify the facilities and 
pollutants to be covered by the PAL.  Specifically, an applicant must detail:
[A] list of all facilities, including their registration or permit number to be 
included in the PAL; their potential to emit, and the excepted maximum 
capacity.  In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate 
which, if any, federal or state applicable requirements, emission 
limitations, or work practices apply to each unit.23
This requirement closely tracks the federal provisions.
Moreover, logic dictates, and the federal rules recognize, that not every facility 
emits every regulated pollutant.  Under the federal rules “[e]ach PAL shall regulate emissions of 
only one pollutant.”24  
Additionally, EPA has recognized that states may implement PAL programs in a 
more limited manner.  In its 1996 proposal for the PAL concept, EPA noted: 
States may choose . . . to adopt the PAL approach on a limited basis.  For 
example, States may choose to adopt the PAL approach only in 
attainment/unclassifiable areas, or only in nonattainment areas, for 
specified source categories, or only for certain pollutants in these areas.25
The Texas PAL provisions track the federal regulations, and so should be 
approved.
5.
The federal definition of “baseline actual emissions” should be 
used.

EPA Comment:

“The submitted definition of the term ‘baseline actual emissions’ 
found at 30 TAC 116.12(3)(A), (B), (D), and (E) differs from the 
Federal definition by providing that the baseline shall be 
calculated as ‘the rate, in tons per year at which the unit actually 
emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month period.’”  
TIP Response:
The substance of EPA’s concern appears to be that the Texas rules are missing the 
word “average.”  The missing term is not grounds for disapproval of the Texas definition of 
“baseline actual emissions.”  The omission of the term “average” from this phrase in the § 
116.12(3) definition does not render the definition invalid or inconsistent with the equivalent 
provision in 40 CFR Part 51.  EPA cites a distinction without a substantive difference, as 
application of the two definitions will reach the same conclusion with regard to the tons per year 
(“tpy”) emission rate over the 24-month baseline period.  The Texas definition of “baseline 
actual emissions” in the proposed SIP revision is equivalent to the federal definition in this 
regard and should be approved.
6.
PAL permits should be issued with 30-day public notice and 
comment.
EPA Comment:

“[T]here is no provision that PALs be established, renewed, or 
increased through a procedure that is consistent with 40 CFR 
51.160 and 51.161, including the requirement that the 
reviewing authority provide the public with notice of the 
proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a 30-day 
period for submittal of public comment, consistent with the 
Federal PAL rules at 40 CFR 51.165(f)(5) and (11) and 
51.166(w)(5) and (11).”  

“For PALs for existing major stationary sources, there is no 
requirement that the State address all material comments 
before taking final action on the permit, consistent with 40 
CFR 51.165(f)(5) and 51.166(w)(5). 3) The applicability 
provision in section 39.403 does not include PALs, despite the 
cross-reference to Chapter 39 in Section 116.194.”
TIP Response:
EPA appears to be concerned that there is not an explicit reference to PALs in the 
public participation provisions.  The Texas rules make clear that PALs are subject to public 
notice and participation.  The absence of a reference to PALs in the applicability section of 30 

AUS01:566013.8
8
TAC § 39.403 is not significant.  Section 116.194 of the PAL rules provides the clear cross-
references to the applicable provisions of Chapter 39.26  A reference back from Chapter 39 to the 
PAL rules is redundant and unnecessary, and not grounds for disapproval of the Texas PAL 
rules.
7.
The federal PAL monitoring definitions must be included.
EPA Comment:

“The State also failed to include the following specific 
monitoring definitions: “Continuous emissions monitoring 
system (CEMS)” as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxi) and 
51.166(b)(43); “Continuous emissions rate monitoring system 
(CERMS)” as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxiv) and 
51.166(b)(46); “Continuous parameter monitoring system 
(CPMS)” as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxiii) and 
51.166(b)(45); and “Predictive emissions monitoring system 
(PEMS)” as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxii) and 
51.166(b)(44). All of these definitions concerning the 
monitoring systems in the revised Major NSR SIP requirements 
are essential for the enforceability of and providing the means 
for determining compliance with a PALs program.”
TIP Response:
EPA appears to be concerned that the monitoring provisions are not separately 
and discretely defined.  The Texas PAL rules in 30 TAC § 116.194(c) contain monitoring 
requirements that are equivalent to the federal PAL rules.  The absence of definitions of CEMS, 
CERMS, CPMS and PEMS does not render the rules unenforceable.  The rules themselves 
identify and define each type of monitoring system, and identify federal-equivalent requirements 
that each monitoring system must satisfy.   For example:
An owner or operator using a continuous emission monitoring 
system (CEMS) to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the 
following requirements.
(i)
The 
CEMS 
must 
comply 
with 
applicable 
performance specifications found in 40 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 60, Appendix B.
(ii)
The CEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at 
least every 15 minutes while the emissions unit is operating.27
Similar requirements are included for mass balance calculations, CPMS, PEMS and emissions 
factors used to monitor PAL pollutant emissions.  The absence of separate definitions does not

impact the enforceability of Texas PALs.  The Texas provisions adequately address monitoring 
requirements for PALs, and should therefore be approved.
B.
Non-PAL NSR Reform
1.
The Definition of “facility” should be limited to an emissions 
unit.
EPA Comment:

“The submitted NNSR non-PAL rules do not explicitly limit the 
definition of ‘facility’ to an ‘emissions unit’ as do the submitted 
PSD non-PAL rules.”
TIP Response
The term “facility” is defined in Chapter 116 and in the Texas Clean Air Act, and 
is used in a consistent manner throughout.  The term has identical meaning in the NNSR non-
PAL rules and the PSD non-PAL rules.  Any failure to “explicitly limit the definition” in one 
part of Chapter 116 is not grounds for disapproval, given the well-established definition of 
“facility” in the context of Texas air permitting and that it is comparable to the federal definition 
of “emissions unit.”
TCEQ regulations in 30 TAC § 116.10(6) defines a facility as: 
A discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure 
that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.  A mine, quarry, well test, or road 
is not a facility.
30 TAC § 116.10(6).  Section 116.10 states that the definitions contained in the section apply to 
all uses throughout Chapter 116.  30 TAC § 116.10 (“[T]he following words and terms, when 
used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates 
otherwise.”) 
This definition is similar to the definition of “emission unit” in Texas’s Title V 
rules.  There, “emissions unit” is defined as:
A discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure 
that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.
30 TAC § 122.10(8).  Under the express terms of § 116.10, the definition of “facility” is clear, 
and is equivalent to the federal definition of “emission unit” in the nonattainment NSR non-PAL 
rules, as it is throughout Chapter 116.

AUS01:566013.8

2.
The definition of “baseline emission” and “projected annual 
emission” 
should 
include 
startups, 
shutdowns 
and 
malfunctions.
EPA Comment:

The definition of the term “baseline actual emissions,” as 
submitted in 30 TAC 116.12(3)(E), does not require the 
inclusion of emissions resulting from startups, shutdowns, and 
malfunctions.
TIP Response:
The Texas rules’ treatment of startups, shutdowns and malfunctions is not a 
proper basis for disapproval of the proposed SIP revision.  The federal and Texas definitions 
both require that non-compliant emissions be excluded from the determination of baseline actual 
emissions.28  Based on the Texas rules’ integration of pending Chapter 101 revisions on MSS 
emissions (as requested by EPA), the proposed SIP revision’s treatment of MSS emissions is a 
reasonable approach.  
EPA has approved rules for baseline calculations that exclude some of the 
elements they assert should be included in the Texas’s definition.  For example, Georgia’s PSD 
regulations give applicants the option of excluding malfunction emissions from the calculation of 
baseline emissions.29  In approving this approach, EPA noted “The intent behind this optional 
calculation methodology is that it may result in a more accurate estimate of emission increases. 
The federal rules allow for some flexibility, and EPA supports EPD’s analysis that the Georgia 
rule is at least as stringent as the federal rule.”30  Similarly, Texas’s approach to the baseline 
calculation attempts for a more accurate estimate of emissions.
Moreover, TCEQ is underway in permitting maintenance, startup and shutdown 
(“MSS”) emissions through Chapter 116 preconstruction permits, and a SIP revision reflecting 
the MSS permitting initiative has been submitted to EPA for approval.  The TCEQ is 
distinguishing between planned and unplanned MSS emissions, and working to authorize those 
planned MSS emissions in Texas air permits.  It is reasonable and appropriate that the MSS 
permitting initiative be properly integrated with the definition of “baseline actual emissions.”  
The proposed SIP revision recognizes that such emissions may be added to the baseline in the 
future, based on TCEQ’s ongoing process of authorizing MSS emissions.  The proposed SIP 
revision and the TCEQ’s current approach is sound and reasonable based on historical treatment 
of MSS emissions in Texas air permits, and is not grounds for disapproval of the proposed SIP 
revision.

The federal definition of “baseline actual emissions should be 
used.”
EPA Comment:

“The Federal definition of the “baseline actual emissions” 
provides that these emissions must be calculated in terms of 
“the average rate, in tons per year at which the unit actually 
emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month 
period.” The submitted definition of the term “baseline actual 
emissions” found at 30 TAC 116.12 (3)(A), (B), (D), and (E) 
differs from the Federal definition by providing that the 
baseline shall be calculated as “the rate, in tons per year at 
which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any 
consecutive 24-month period.”
TIP Response:
As stated earlier, the omission of the term “average” is not grounds for 
disapproval of the Texas definition of “baseline actual emissions.”  The omission of the term 
“average” from this phrase in the § 116.12(3) definition of does not render the definition invalid 
or inconsistent with the equivalent provision in 40 CFR Part 51.  EPA cites a distinction without 
a substantive difference, as application of the two definitions will reach the same conclusion with 
regard to the tons per year (“tpy”) emission rate over the 24-month baseline period.  The Texas 
definition of “baseline actual emissions” in the proposed SIP revision is equivalent to the federal 
definition in this regard and should be approved.
III.
Substance of Asserted Deficiencies One-Hour Nonattainment NSR 
1.
The revisions do not meet the anti-backsliding Major 
Nonattainment NSR SIP Requirements for the 1-hour Ozone 
NAAQS.
EPA Comments:

""The footnote 6 and the introductory paragraph add a new 
requirement for an affirmative regulatory action by the EPA on 
the reinstatement of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS major 
nonattainment 
NSR 
requirements 
before 
the 
major 
nonattainment NSR requirements under the 1-hour standard 
come will be implemented in the Texas 1-hour ozone.”

""The currently approved Texas major nonattainment NSR SIP 
does not require such an affirmative regulatory action by the 
EPA before the 1-hour ozone major nonattainment NSR 
requirements come into effect in the Texas 1-hour ozone 
nonattainment areas.""

AUS01:566013.8
12
TIP Response:
The cited provisions of the Texas rules regarding the 1-hour/8-hour transition are 
neither inconsistent with the CAA, nor the court’s decision in South Coast.  With its remand to 
EPA following vacatur of parts of the Phase 1 transition rule, the South Coast court did not offer 
specific direction concerning implementation of the backsliding requirements as they apply to 
NSR.  However, the court in its Opinion on Petitions for Rehearing “urged” EPA “to act 
promptly in promulgating a revised rule that effectuates the statutory mandate by implementing 
the eight-hour standard . . . .”  South Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. v. EPA, 489 F.3d 1245, 
1248-49 (D.C. Cir. 2007).
Consistent with the court’s direction in South Coast, the language of CAA § 
172(e) suggests that EPA must take definite action to implement anti-backsliding requirements:
If the Administrator relaxes a national primary ambient air quality 
standard . . . the Administrator shall, within 12 months after the 
relaxation, promulgate requirements applicable to all areas which 
have not attained that standard as of the date of such relaxation.  
Such requirements shall provide for controls which are not less 
stringent than the controls applicable to areas designated 
nonattainment before such relaxation.
42 U.S.C. § 7502(e) (emphasis added).  An October 2007 memorandum from EPA Deputy 
Administrator Robert Meyers stated that EPA intends to undertake rulemaking to conform the 
Agency's NSR regulations to the South Coast decision.   However, EPA has not yet proposed 
such a rule.  The footnote 6 and introductory paragraph cited in EPA’s proposed disapproval are 
consistent with CAA § 172(e) and not a basis for disapproval of the proposed SIP revision.
2.
The revision uses the incorrect applicability date under EPA's 
Major NSR rules.
EPA Comments:

“The rule, adopted and submitted in 2005, applies the date of 
administrative completeness of a permit application, not the 
date of permit issuance, where setting the date for 
determination of NSR applicability after June 15, 2004 (the 
effective date of ozone nonattainment designations). The 
submitted 2006 rule adds the date of permit issuance. 
Unfortunately, the submitted 2006 rule by introducing a 
bifurcated structure creates vagueness rather than clarity.”

“[T]o the extent that the date of application completeness is 
used in certain instances to establish the applicability date, 
such use is contrary to the Act and EPA’s interpretation 
thereof.”

AUS01:566013.8
13
TIP Response:
The applicability cutoff established in the TCEQ rules is not inconsistent with the 
CAA or EPA rules.  While it may be inconsistent with EPA’s interpretation of that rule language, 
the use of application completeness as an applicability date is not inconsistent with Part 51 itself.  
As a result, the applicability cutoff dates established in 30 TAC § 116.150(a) are not appropriate 
grounds for disapproval of the proposed SIP revision.  EPA concerns regarding applicability 
dates are properly addressed through comments on individual permits, and not through a 
disapproval of the SIP revision.
IV.
Pollution Control Project Standard Permit
1.
A standard permit cannot address site-specific determinations.
EPA Comment:

“A Standard Permit provides a streamlined mechanism with all 
permitting requirements for construction and operation of 
certain sources in categories that contain numerous similar 
sources. It is not a case-by-case minor NSR SIP permit. 
Therefore, each minor NSR SIP Standard Permit must contain 
all terms and conditions on the face of it (combined with the 
SIP general requirements) and it cannot be used to address 
site-specific determinations.”
TIP Response:
The Pollution Control Project (“PCP”) standard permit does contain on its face all 
requirements applicable to its use.31  The rule requires that a permittee make a submittal to 
TCEQ, but does not require the Executive Director to act to approve the submittal.  Under the 
rules, if the Executive Director does not act, the authorization under the permit stands.  Review 
by the Executive Director is not to make case-by-case determination, but  rather to review for 
impacts on air quality and disallow use if air quality would be negatively impacted. 32  This is an 
important distinction.  The Texas PCP permit is more stringent than a program that lacks a 
discretionary denial provision.
Moreover, the PCP is a minor NSR authorization.  The CAA does not establish 
requirements for a state’s minor NSR programs.  The federal regulations that govern minor NSR 
programs at 40 CFR §§ 51.160-.164 provide states great flexibility in establishing SIP-
approvable minor NSR programs.  Indeed, EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board (“EAB”) has 
recognized the flexibility provided states in establishing a non-PSD, non-nonattainment NSR 
permitting program, noting that federal requirements do not mandate a particular minor NSR 
applicability methodology or test.33

AUS01:566013.8
14
In light of this flexibility, the Texas PCP standard permit is an acceptable part of 
the state’s minor NSR SIP.  Notably, EPA cites no statutory authority or provision of Part 51 in 
suggesting a bar on approval of general or standard permits.  The manner in which the TCEQ 
implements the PCP standard permit is reasonable and practical, and a decision to reject the PCP 
standard permit is a decision to reject an important minor NSR tool used by Texas sources to 
authorize environmentally beneficial projects in an expedited fashion.  Site-specific traditional 
NSR permitting for such projects is impractical, inefficient and detrimental to the environment. 
2.
A standard permit must be limited to a single source category.
EPA Comment:

“An individual Standard Permit must be limited to a single 
source category, which consists of numerous similar sources 
that can meet standardized permit conditions.”
TIP Response:
As noted above, states have great flexibility in establishing the requirements of a 
minor NSR SIP.  In light of this flexibility, the manner in which the TCEQ has defined the PCP 
standard permit is an acceptable part of the Texas minor NSR SIP.  Notably, EPA cites no 
statutory authority or provision of Part 51 in suggesting a bar on approval of general or standard 
permits or for limiting the PCP standard permit to a single source category.  The manner in 
which the TCEQ has defined pollution control projects is reasonable and practical, and a 
decision to reject the PCP standard permit is a decision to reject an important minor NSR tool 
used by Texas sources to authorize environmentally beneficial projects in an expedited fashion.  
Narrowing the scope of projects that can qualify for the expedited standard permit approval (or 
requiring the TCEQ to promulgate source category-specific PCP standard permits for every 
source category in Texas) is impractical, inefficient and detrimental to the environment. 
3.
The Executive Director's discretion is not properly limited.
EPA Comment:

“There are no replicable conditions in the PCP Standard 
Permit that specify how the Director’s discretion is to be 
implemented for the individual determinations.  Of particular 
concern is the provision that allows for the exercise of the 
Executive Director’s discretion in making case-specific 
determinations in individual cases in lieu of generic 
enforceable requirements.  Because EPA approval will not be 
required in each individual case, specific replicable criteria 
must be set forth in the Standard Permit establishing 
equivalent emissions rates and ambient impact.”

TIP reiterates the comments from Section IV.1 above.  Review by the Executive 
Director is not to make case-by-case determination, but  rather to review for impacts on air 
quality and disallow use if air quality would be negatively impacted.  The Texas PCP permit is 
more stringent than a program that lacks a discretionary denial provision.  Also, as noted above, 
states have great flexibility in establishing the requirements of a minor NSR SIP.  In light of this 
flexibility, the discretion granted the TCEQ Executive Director in making case-specific 
determinations regarding pollution control projects under the PCP standard permit is an 
acceptable part of the Texas minor NSR SIP.  Notably, EPA cites no statutory authority or 
provision of Part 51 in suggesting a bar on approval of general or standard permits or for limiting 
the Executive Director’s discretion in implementing the PCP standard permit.  
V.
The removal of the incorporation by reference of the federal PSD definition 
of BACT.
EPA Comments:

“The 2006 submittal also removed from the State rules, the 
PSD SIP requirement at 40 CFR 52.21(r)(4). . . [This revision 
provides that] if a project becomes a major stationary source 
or major modification solely because of a relaxation of an 
enforceable limitation on the source or modification’s capacity 
to emit a pollutant, then the source or modification is subject to 
PSD applies as if construction had not yet commenced.”

“As the mechanism in Texas for ensuring that permits contain 
such a requirement, the State PSD SIP must both require 
BACT and apply the federal definition of BACT (or one that is 
more stringent) to be approved pursuant to part C and Section 
110(l) of the Act.”
TIP Response:
Texas submitted a revision to 30 TAC 116.160(a) and a new section 116.160(c)(1) 
and (2) on February 1, 2006, as a SIP revision to the Texas PSD SIP.  This SIP revision 
reorganized the earlier SIP-approved rules.
Prior to the currently-reviewed revisions, Texas had incorporated by reference 
certain provisions of 40 CFR 52.21.  The current SIP-approved rule was adopted by the State on 
October 10, 2001, and EPA approved this recodified SIP rule citation on July 22, 2004.34    
Since 1972, Texas has correctly imposed a control technology review on 
applications for an air quality permit.35  Section 382.0518(b)(1) of the Texas Clean Air Act 
                                               
34 69 Fed. Reg. 43,752 (July 22, 2004).
35 See TACB, Regulation VI § I(B)(2) (July 5, 1972).  

AUS01:566013.8
16
(“TCAA”)  requires that “the proposed facility for which a permit, permit amendment, or a 
special permit is sought will use at least the best available control technology, considering the 
technical practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions 
from the facility.”36  This requirement is echoed in Section 116.111(a)(2)(C) of TCEQ’s rules, 
which requires that “the proposed facility utilize BACT, with consideration given to the technical 
practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions from the 
facility.” 37
The term BACT has been defined by TCEQ in strict accordance with the statutory 
BACT requirement in the TCAA.  Specifically, 30 TAC § 116.10(3) defines BACT as “BACT 
with consideration given to the technical practicability and the economic reasonableness of 
reducing or eliminating emissions from the facility.”  The TCEQ has stated that this definition 
shall apply to all use of the term “BACT” in Chapter 116 of its rules, unless the context clearly 
indicates otherwise.38    
The Texas regulations have continuously carved out 40 CFR 52.21(j), concerning 
control technology review, which is the federal BACT requirement, from the Texas PSD 
regulations.  This is true from 1992 when EPA first granted authority to Texas to administer PSD 
permitting.  As part of the 1992 approval, EPA explained why the federal control technology 
review requirement of Section 52.21(j) could be properly excluded by Texas under the federal 
Clean Air Act.  EPA explained:
This provision of the Federal PSD regulations has been excluded 
from the TACB Regulation VI because the TACB claims that the 
Texas Clean Air Act and the existing State regulations have 
provisions for application of BACT as stringent as the Federal 
requirements in reviewing the permit applications.  The EPA 
review of the Texas Clean Air Act and Regulation VI (Sections 
116.3(a)(3) through 116.3(a)(5)) have indeed revealed that existing 
TACB permit requirements meet the provisions of the Federal PSD 
regulations . . . .39
EPA then stated in the final rule approving the Texas PSD program that the federal control 
technology review requirement, which requires BACT for PSD applications, was “not necessary 
for approval of the Texas Program.”40
The preamble to the 2006 revisions to §116.160 in which the incorporations by 
reference of 40 CFR 52.21 were changed, demonstrate a consistency with the approach taken by 
the State in the preceding years.  The preamble explains the incorporation by reference of certain 
                                               
36 TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.0518(b)(1).

sections of 40 CFR 52.21 and further states, “[o]ther definitions used for the PSD program or 
visibility in Class I areas program are currently in [TCEQ’s] rules.”41  
The appropriate BACT definition exists in Texas’s rules, as demonstrated by EPA’s past 
approval of those rules.  All permits Texas has issued under the existing permitting program 
reflect the current TCEQ SIP-approved approach to BACT, and are valid and enforceable.
VI.
Conclusion
TIP strongly supports full approval of existing Texas NSR provisions and 
pollution control standard permit.  The Texas permitting program, including these provisions, is 
stringent, comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.  
Additionally, the Texas NSR rules track closely the federal NSR rules.  In instances where the 
Texas provisions depart from the exact wording of the federal rules, Texas has justified those 
departures.  The Texas NSR rules and associated rules are equivalent to the federal rules and 
should be approved.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reclassified the eight-county 
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area from a moderate to a severe nonattainment area for the 
1997 eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) effective on October 
31, 2008.  The HGB eight-county area includes Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, 
Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties.  The EPA set April 15, 2010, as the date for 
the state to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) revision addressing the severe ozone 
nonattainment area requirements of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments (FCAA).  The 
HGB area must attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard of 0.08 parts per million (ppm) as 
expeditiously as practicable but no later than the attainment date of June 15, 2019.  Since 
emission reductions needed for attainment must be implemented by the beginning of the ozone 
season immediately preceding the HGB area’s attainment date, implementation of controls need 
to be made by 2018, which is the attainment year for modeling. 
 
This SIP revision addresses ozone formation in the HGB area, the precursor emissions of nitrogen 
oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), the control strategies that are to be 
implemented, the quantity of emission reductions associated with each strategy, and when these 
reductions will occur.  Based on photochemical modeling and an evaluation of corroborative 
evidence, ozone measurements in the HGB area are predicted to be compliant with the 1997 
eight-hour ozone NAAQS by June 15, 2019. 
 
The existing measures to control ozone formation in the HGB area that have been adopted in 
previous SIP revisions center on: 
 
• 
approximately 80 percent NOX emission reductions from point sources through the Mass 
Emission Cap and Trade (MECT) program; 
• 
NOX emission reductions from on-road and non-road sources through the vehicle 
inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, the Texas Emission Reduction Plan (TERP), 
and the Texas Low Emission Diesel (TxLED) program; 
• 
highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) controls through the associated 
HRVOC Emission Cap and Trade (HECT) program; and 
• 
VOC controls. 
 
See Chapter 4, Control Strategies and Required Elements, Section 4.2, Existing Control 
Measures for a complete list of control measures. 
 
Despite the significant decreases in one-hour and eight-hour ozone design values and in NOX  and 
VOC emissions in the HGB area, further reductions are needed to bring the area into attainment 
of the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS.  Even as key ozone-targeting regulatory programs have 
reduced the number and magnitude of ozone exceedances, the area of exceedance, and the 
population exposed to exceedances, economic and population growth continue to create air 
quality challenges for the HGB area. 
 
This submittal contains proposed new state and local control measures.  The Houston-Galveston 
Area Council (H-GAC), as the regional metropolitan transportation planning agency for the HGB 
area, has identified three voluntary programs that will aid in the improvement of the HGB area’s 
air quality. The H-GAC’s commitment for NOX  emissions reductions from the Voluntary Mobile 
Emission Reduction Program (VMEP) is 2.25 tons per day (tpd).  The H-GAC has also identified 
transportations control measures (TCMs) that have been or will be implemented in the 
 
i 

 
nonattainment area.  By the start of the 2018 ozone season, these TCMs will reduce NOX 
emissions in the HGB area by 0.015 tpd. 
 
Photochemical modeling analysis demonstrates that a 25 percent reduction of the HECT cap on 
the total Harris County HRVOC allocation would contribute to attainment of the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone NAAQS by reducing the future 2018 ozone design values at all HGB monitors.  
Accordingly, this SIP revision contains a proposed 25 percent reduction in the total HRVOC 
allowance cap and revision to the HRVOC allocation methodology.  The HECT program will 
continue to be applicable only in Harris County. 
 
This plan demonstrates attainment using photochemical modeling that includes the existing and 
proposed control strategies previously listed.  The demonstration also relies on weight of 
evidence (WoE) corroborative analysis and additional control measures not explicitly accounted 
for in the photochemical modeling (see Chapter 5, Weight of Evidence). 
 
This SIP revision includes base case modeling of representative ozone exceedance episodes that 
occurred during 2005 and 2006.  In general, the model performance evaluation of the base cases 
for 2005 and 2006 indicates the modeling is suitable for use in conducting the modeling 
attainment test.  The modeling attainment test was applied by modeling a 2006 baseline year and 
2018 future year to project 2018 eight-hour ozone design values.  Only two regulatory monitors, 
Deer Park (DRPK) and Bayland Park (BAYP), and one non-regulatory monitor, Wallisville 
(WALV), are projected to have modeled 2018 eight-hour ozone design values greater than the 
1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. 
 
Modeling analyses of the sensitivity of the 2018 projected eight-hour ozone design values to 
emission reductions of NOX and VOC generally indicate that the ozone design values are more 
sensitive to NOX reductions than VOC.  However, the sensitivity of ozone design values to 
reductions in HRVOC is much greater than for other VOC.   
 
Table ES-1:  Summary of 2006 Baseline, 2018 Future Year, and 2018 Control Strategy 
Anthropogenic Modeling Emissions for HGB lists the anthropogenic modeling emissions in tons 
per day (tpd) by source category for the 2006 baseline, 2018 future year, and the 2018 control 
strategies for NOX and VOC.  The differences in modeling emissions between the 2006 baseline 
and the 2018 future year reflect the net of growth and existing controls.  The existing controls 
include both state and federal measures that have already been promulgated.  The differences in 
modeling emissions between the 2018 future year and the 2018 control strategy reflect the 
proposed controls.  These proposed controls include NOX reductions from both the VMEP 
measures and TCMs, and the 25 percent reduction in the Harris County total HRVOC cap for the 
HECT program.

Table ES-2:  Summary of 2006 Baseline, 2018 Future Year, and 2018 Control Strategy Eight-
Hour Ozone Design Values for BAYP and DRPK Monitors lists the eight-hour ozone design 
values in parts per billion (ppb) for the 2006 baseline (DVB), 2018 baseline future year (DVF), 
and 2018 control strategy for the two regulatory monitors with model-projected 2018 eight-hour 
ozone design values greater than the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS.  However, 18 regulatory 
monitors have model-projected 2018 eight-hour ozone design values less than the 1997 eight-
hour ozone NAAQS.  Since the modeling cannot provide an absolute prediction of future year 
ozone design values, additional information from corroborative analyses are used in assessing 
whether the area will attain the standard in the future year.

This SIP revision provides ozone reduction trends analyses and supplementary data to 
demonstrate that the HGB eight-county nonattainment area will attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone 
standard of 0.08 ppm (84 parts per billion (ppb)).  The EPA’s April 2007 “Guidance on the Use 
of Models and Other Analyses for Demonstrating Attainment of Air Quality Goals for Ozone, 
PM2.5, and Regional Haze” states that a weight of evidence demonstration is allowed when the 
future design value is at or below 87.9 ppb.  The quantitative and qualitative corroborative 
analyses in Chapter 5, Weight of Evidence, support a conclusion that this SIP revision 
demonstrates attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. 
 
This revision also includes FCAA-required SIP elements, including a reasonably available control 
measures (RACM) analysis, a reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis, a motor 
vehicle emissions budget (MVEB), and a contingency plan.  For the MVEB, see Table ES-3:

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is committed to developing and 
applying the best science and technology towards addressing and reducing ozone formation in 
HGB and other nonattainment areas in Texas.  This SIP revision also includes a description of 
how the TCEQ continues to use new technology, such as infrared VOC imaging to identify and 
control unaddressed or under-addressed pollution sources, to investigate possible emission 
reduction strategies, and other practical methods to continue making progress in air quality 
improvement.  For more information, see Chapter 6, Ongoing and Future Initiatives.

SECTION V:  LEGAL AUTHORITY 
 
A.  General 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has the legal authority to implement, 
maintain, and enforce the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to control the 
quality of the state’s air, including maintaining adequate visibility. 
 
The first air pollution control act, known as the Clean Air Act of Texas, was passed by the Texas 
Legislature in 1965.  In 1967, the Clean Air Act of Texas was superseded by a more 
comprehensive statute, the Texas Clean Air Act (TCAA), found in Article 4477-5, Vernon’s 
Texas Civil Statutes.  The legislature amended the TCAA in 1969, 1971, 1973, 1979, 1985, 1987, 
1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009.  In 1989, the TCAA was 
codified as Chapter 382 of the Texas Health & Safety Code.   
 
Originally, the TCAA stated that the Texas Air Control Board (TACB) is the state air pollution 
control agency and is principal authority in the state on matters relating to the quality of air 
resources.  In 1991, the legislature abolished the TACB effective September 1, 1993, and its 
powers, duties, responsibilities, and functions were transferred to the Texas Natural Resource 
Conservation Commission (TNRCC).  With the creation of the TNRCC, the authority over air 
quality is found in both the Texas Water Code and the TCAA.  Specifically, the authority of the 
TNRCC is found in Chapters 5 and 7.  Chapter 5, Subchapters A - F, H - J, and L, include the 
general provisions, organization, and general powers and duties of the TNRCC, and the 
responsibilities and authority of the executive director.  This chapter also authorizes the TNRCC 
to implement action when emergency conditions arise, and to conduct hearings.  Chapter 7 gives 
the TNRCC enforcement authority.  In 2001, the 77th Texas Legislature continued the existence 
of the TNRCC until September 1, 2013, and changed the name of the TNRCC to the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).  In 2009, the 81st Texas Legislature, during a 
special session, amended § 5.014 of the Texas Water Code, changing the expiration date of the 
TCEQ to September 1, 2011, unless continued in existence by the Texas Sunset Act. 
 
The TCAA specifically authorizes the TCEQ to establish the level of quality to be maintained in 
the state’s air and to control the quality of the state’s air by preparing and developing a general, 
comprehensive plan.  The TCAA, Subchapters A - D, also authorize the TCEQ to collect 
information to enable the commission to develop an inventory of emissions; to conduct research 
and investigations; to enter property and examine records; to prescribe monitoring requirements; 
to institute enforcement proceedings; to enter into contracts and execute instruments; to formulate 
rules; to issue orders taking into consideration factors bearing upon health, welfare, social and 
economic factors, and practicability and reasonableness; to conduct hearings; to establish air 
quality control regions; to encourage cooperation with citizens’ groups and other agencies and 
political subdivisions of the state as well as with industries and the federal government; and to 
establish and operate a system of permits for construction or modification of facilities.   
 
Local government authority is found in Subchapter E of the TCAA.  Local governments have the 
same power as the TCEQ to enter property and make inspections.  They also may make 
recommendations to the Commission concerning any action of the TCEQ that affects their 
territorial jurisdiction, may bring enforcement actions, and may execute cooperative agreements 
with the TCEQ or other local governments.  In addition, a city or town may enact and enforce 
ordinances for the control and abatement of air pollution not inconsistent with the provisions of 
the TCAA and the rules or orders of the Commission. 
 
 
v 

 
Subchapters G and H of the TCAA authorize the TCEQ to establish vehicle inspection and 
maintenance programs in certain areas of the state, consistent with the requirements of the federal 
Clean Air Act; coordinate with federal, state, and local transportation planning agencies to 
develop and implement transportation programs and measures necessary to attain and maintain 
the NAAQS; establish gasoline volatility and low emission diesel standards; and fund and 
authorize participating counties to implement vehicle repair assistance, retrofit, and accelerated 
vehicle retirement programs.

CHAPTER 1:  GENERAL 
 
1.1  BACKGROUND 
The “History of the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP),” a comprehensive overview of the 
SIP revisions submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the 
State of Texas, is available at the following Web site: 
 http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/sip/sipintro.html#History. 
 
1.2  INTRODUCTION 
The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area’s hot, sunny climate, large urban population 
activities, and extensive, highly concentrated industrial complex provide the ingredients for ozone 
formation:  sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NOX), and volatile organic compounds (VOC).  The 
Houston area’s significant biogenic VOC emissions and complex meteorology, which includes 
land/sea breeze air parcel recirculation, complicate air quality modeling.  Economic and 
population growth continue to create air quality challenges for the HGB area.  However, key 
ozone-targeting regulatory programs have reduced the number and magnitude of ozone 
exceedances, the area of exceedance, and the population exposed to exceedances. 
 
1.2.1  One-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) History 
The EPA established the one-hour ozone NAAQS of 0.08 parts per million (ppm) in the April 30, 
1971, issue of the Federal Register (36 FR 8186).  The EPA revised the one-hour ozone standard 
to 0.12 ppm in the February 8, 1979, issue of the Federal Register (44 FR 4202).  The eight-
county HGB area, defined as Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, 
Montgomery, and Waller Counties, was first designated as a nonattainment area for the one-hour 
ozone NAAQS established by the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) in the November 6, 1991, issue 
of the Federal Register (56 FR 56694).  The HGB area was classified as a Severe-17 
nonattainment area, which required it to attain the one-hour ozone NAAQS by November 15, 
2007.  The one-hour ozone NAAQS was revoked in the June 15, 2005, issue of the Federal 
Register (69 FR 23951). 
 
The following summaries of HGB area one-hour ozone SIP revisions are provided to give context 
and greater understanding of the complex issues involved in HGB’s ozone challenge.  For a 
summary of ozone SIP revisions in the HGB area prior to December 2000, please refer to the 
“History of the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP),” mentioned in Section 1.1 of this chapter.  
 
1.2.1.1  December 2000 
The Post-1999 Rate-of-Progress (ROP) and Attainment Demonstration SIP for the 
Houston/Galveston Ozone Nonattainment Area revision contained rules and photochemical 
modeling analyses in support of the HGB one-hour ozone attainment demonstration.  The 
majority of the emission reductions identified in this revision resulted from an overall 90 percent 
reduction in point source NOX implemented through 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 
Chapter 117 and the Mass Emissions Cap and Trade (MECT) program in 30 TAC Chapter 101.  
A modeling analysis, which showed a 141 parts per billion (ppb) peak ozone level, indicated a 
shortfall of 91 tons per day (tpd) in NOX emissions reductions that were necessary, but not readily 
available, for an approvable attainment demonstration.  In addition, the revision contained a post-
1999 ROP plan for the milestone years 2002 and 2005, as well as the attainment year 2007, and 
transportation conformity motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for NOX and VOC.  The 
SIP revision also contained enforceable commitments to implement further measures (in support 
of the HGB area’s attainment demonstration and to remedy the estimated 91 tpd shortfall), 
Voluntary Mobile Emission Reduction Program (VMEP) measures, as well as a commitment to 
perform and submit a mid-course review (MCR) to the EPA.

The 
Post-1999 
ROP 
and 
Attainment 
Demonstration 
Follow-Up 
SIP 
for 
the 
Houston/Galveston Ozone Nonattainment Area revision included the following elements: 1) 
corrections to the ROP table/budget for the years 2002, 2005, and 2007 due to a mathematical 
error; 2) incorporation of a change to the idling restriction control strategy, which clarified that 
the operator of a rented or leased vehicle is responsible for compliance with the requirements in 
situations where the operator of a leased or rented vehicle is not employed by the owner of the 
vehicle; 3) incorporation of revisions to the clean diesel fuel rules to provide greater flexibility in 
complying with the rule requirements while preserving the emission reductions previously 
represented; 4) incorporation of a stationary diesel engine rule; 5) incorporation of revisions to 
the point source NOX rules; 6) incorporation of revisions to the NOX emissions cap and trade 
rules; 7) removal of the construction equipment operating restriction and the accelerated purchase 
requirement for Tier 2/Tier 3 heavy-duty equipment; 8) replacement of the Tier 2/Tier 3 rules 
with the Texas Emission Reduction Plan (TERP); 9) layout of the MCR process that detailed how 
the state would fulfill the commitment to obtain the additional emission reductions necessary to 
demonstrate attainment of the one-hour ozone standard in the HGB area; and 10) replacement of 
the 2007 ROP MVEB to be consistent with the attainment demonstration MVEB. 
 
Despite the NOX measures adopted in the December 2000 SIP revision and the stationary diesel 
engine rules included in the September 2001 SIP revision, an estimated 56 tpd NOX reduction 
shortfall remained.  The state committed to address the remaining shortfall through the MCR 
process.  The EPA approved the December 2000 and September 2001 submittals in the 
November 14, 2001, issue of the Federal Register (66 FR 57160). 
 
1.2.1.3  December 2002 
In January 2001, the Business Coalition for Clean Air-Appeal Group (BCCA-AG) and several 
regulated companies challenged the December 2000 HGB SIP revision and the 90 percent NOX 
reduction requirement from stationary sources.  Among other things, BCCA-AG contended that 
the last 10 percent of the NOX emissions reductions were not cost effective and that the ozone 
plan would fail because the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) did not 
account for VOC emissions associated with upset conditions.  In May 2001, the parties agreed to 
a stay in the case, and Judge Margaret Cooper, Travis County District Court, signed a Consent 
Order, effective June 8, 2001.  The order required the commission to perform an independent and 
thorough analysis of the causes of rapid ozone formation events and to identify potential 
mitigating measures not yet included in the HGB attainment demonstration. 
 
In compliance with the Consent Order, the commission conducted a scientific evaluation based in 
large part on aircraft data collected by the Texas Air Quality Study 2000 (TexAQS 2000).  The 
TexAQS 2000 was a comprehensive research project, conducted in August and September 2000, 
involving more than 40 research organizations and over 200 scientists that studied ground-level 
ozone air pollution in the HGB and east Texas regions.  These and other studies suggested that 
the HGB area’s high ozone events can be attributed, in part, to the presence of significant 
reactivity in the airshed.  An analysis of automated gas chromatograph data revealed that four 
highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) were frequently responsible for high 
reactivity days:  ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes.  As such, these compounds 
were selected as the best candidates for HRVOC emission controls.  Analysis showed that the 
ozone control strategy involving limits on emissions of ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, and 
butenes from industrial sources, in conjunction with an 80 percent reduction in industrial or point 
source NOX, was equivalent or better in terms of air quality benefit than the previous ozone 
control strategy (a 90 percent point source NOX emissions reduction requirement alone).  
Therefore, in December 2002, the TCEQ adopted a SIP revision that replaced 10 percent of 
industrial point source NOX emissions reductions with industrial source HRVOC controls.  
HRVOC is defined in 30 TAC Chapter 115 as ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, and all isomers 
of butene for Harris County and ethylene and propylene for the other seven counties in the HGB 
area.  The result was an industrial source ozone control strategy that relies on an 80 percent 

 
1-3
reduction in NOX emissions through Chapter 117 and the MECT program, and HRVOC rules in 
Chapter 115 that better quantify and reduce emissions of HRVOC from four key industrial 
sources:  fugitives, flares, process vents, and cooling tower heat exchange systems.  The HRVOC 
fugitive emission controls are more stringent leak detection and repair requirements for 
components in HRVOC service such as valves and flanges.  The HRVOC rules for flares, process 
vents, and cooling tower heat exchange systems are performance-based and emphasize 
monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, and enforcement, rather than establishing individual unit 
emission rates.  Site-wide HRVOC emission caps were established and adopted in the SIP for 
sites subject to the HRVOC rules for flares, process vents, and cooling tower heat exchange 
systems.  The December 2002 SIP revision exchanging the two strategies for the one strategy met 
the FCAA, §110(l) requirement, which allows a revision of the SIP where that revision would not 
interfere with reasonable further progress toward attainment of the NAAQS. 
 
1.2.1.4  December 2004 
As previously noted in Section 1.2.1.1 of this chapter, in December 2000, the TCEQ committed 
to perform an MCR to ensure attainment of the one-hour ozone standard.  The MCR process 
provided the opportunity to update emissions inventory data, use current modeling tools, and 
enhance the photochemical grid modeling.  The data gathered from the TexAQS 2000 was used 
to improve the photochemical modeling of the HGB area.  These technical improvements 
provided a more comprehensive understanding of the ozone challenge in the HGB area that is 
necessary to develop an attainment plan.  In early 2003, as the TCEQ was preparing to move 
forward with the MCR, the EPA announced its plans to begin implementation of the 1997 eight-
hour ozone standard.  The EPA published its proposed implementation rule for the 1997 eight-
hour ozone standard in the June 2, 2003, issue of the Federal Register (68 FR 32802).  In the 
same timeframe, the EPA formalized its intentions to designate areas for the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone standard by April 15, 2004, requiring states to reassess their efforts and control strategies 
to address this new standard in a revised plan to be submitted to the EPA by June 2007.  
Recognizing that existing one-hour nonattainment areas would soon be subject to the 1997 eight-
hour ozone standard and in an effort to efficiently manage the state’s limited resources, the TCEQ 
developed an approach that addressed the outstanding obligations under the one-hour ozone 
standard while beginning to analyze eight-hour ozone issues. 
 
The TCEQ’s one-hour ozone SIP revision commitments that were addressed in the December 
2004 HGB Ozone Nonattainment Area SIP revision include:  completion of a one-hour ozone 
MCR; performance of modeling; adoption of measures sufficient to fill the shortfall of NOX 
reductions; adoption of measures sufficient to demonstrate attainment; revision of the MVEB 
using the EPA’s MOBILE6 model; and revision of the VMEP measures. 
 
The December 2004 revision reflected a shift from primarily reducing industrial emissions of 
NOX to reducing both industrial emissions of NOX and industrial point source HRVOC.  This 
revision included measures to ensure compliance with the specific strategies to control HRVOC 
emissions and replaced the site-wide caps adopted in the SIP with the HRVOC Emissions Cap 
and Trade (HECT) program in 30 TAC Chapter 101.  The HECT program is an annual cap and 
trade program developed to provide sources compliance flexibility in meeting the control 
requirements for flares, process vents, and cooling tower heat exchange systems in 30 TAC 
Chapter 115.  Sites subject to the program are required to possess an HRVOC allowance for each 
ton of HRVOC emissions.  Sites have the option to trade excess HRVOC allowances on the open 
market.  The December 2004 SIP revision also reflected the repeal of the motor vehicle idling 
rules and modified certain recordkeeping requirements of the general VOC fugitive emission 
rules to make them apply only to sources of HRVOC fugitive emissions. 
 
1.2.1.5  EPA Approval of the One-Hour Ozone Attainment Demonstration 
The EPA published its approval of the HGB nonattainment area one-hour ozone attainment 
demonstration in the September 6, 2006, issue of the Federal Register (71 FR 52656).  Also in a 
separate action, the EPA concurrently approved rules for the control of HRVOC, the HECT 
program, the MECT program, and the emissions reduction credit banking and trading program, 

 
1-4
and conditionally approved rules for the discrete emissions reduction credit banking and trading 
program. 
 
1.2.2  Eight-Hour Ozone NAAQS History 
In 1997, the EPA revised the health-based NAAQS for ozone, setting it at 0.08 ppm averaged 
over an eight-hour time frame.  The final 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS was published in the 
Federal Register on July 18, 1997 (62 FR 38856), and became effective on September 16, 1997.  
On April 30, 2004, the EPA finalized its attainment/nonattainment designations and promulgated 
the first phase of its implementation rule for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard (69 FR 23951).  
These actions became effective on June 15, 2004.  The EPA classified the HGB area as a 
moderate nonattainment area for the standard under the 1990 FCAA (42 United States Code,  
§§ 7401 et seq.).  The TCEQ was required to submit a SIP revision for the 1997 eight-hour ozone 
NAAQS to the EPA by June 15, 2007, and demonstrate attainment of the standard by June 15, 
2010.  In the November 29, 2005, issue of the Federal Register (70 FR 71612) the EPA published 
its second phase of the implementation rule for the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS, which 
addressed the control obligations that apply to areas designated nonattainment for the standard. 
 
The commission adopted the 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area SIP revision and the 
reasonable further progress SIP revision for the HGB area on May 23, 2007.  These SIP revisions 
were the first step in addressing the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard in the HGB area.  The TCEQ 
demonstrated reasonable further progress toward attaining the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard 
and committed to attaining the 1997 standard as expeditiously as practicable and developing an 
HGB 1997 eight-hour ozone attainment demonstration SIP revision. 
 
On June 15, 2007, these two revisions to the Texas SIP and a letter from the governor of Texas 
requesting that the HGB ozone nonattainment area be reclassified from a moderate nonattainment 
area to a severe nonattainment area were submitted to the EPA.  The EPA granted the governor’s 
request to voluntarily reclassify the HGB ozone nonattainment area from a moderate to a severe 
nonattainment area for the 1997 ozone NAAQS in the October 1, 2008, issue of the Federal 
Register (73 FR 56983).  The EPA set April 15, 2010, as the date for the state to submit a revised 
SIP addressing the severe ozone nonattainment area requirements of the FCAA.  The area’s new 
attainment date for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard is as expeditiously as practicable but no 
later than June 15, 2019. 
 
1.2.2.1  May 23, 2007 
On May 23, 2007, the commission adopted the HGB 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Nonattainment 
Area SIP revision.  This SIP revision contained the reasonably available control technology 
(RACT) analysis, additional VMEP commitments, and the Texas 2002 Periodic Emissions 
Inventory for the HGB Ozone Nonattainment Area.  This SIP revision also included rule 
revisions to 30 TAC Chapter 114 to add marine diesel fuels to the definition of diesel fuels that 
are subject to the Texas Low Emission Diesel Rule and to 30 TAC Chapter 115 to control 
underestimated, unreported, or underreported VOC emissions from tank landings, flash 
emissions, and degassing of storage tanks, transport vessels, and marine vessels with liquid heels.  
In an associated rulemaking project, 30 TAC Chapter 117 was reformatted and the 10 nanogram 
per Joule (ng/J) heat input NOX standard for residential water heaters was repealed in accordance 
with House Bill (HB) 965, 79th Texas Legislature, 2005.  The emission standard of 40 ng/J NOX 
was retained. 
 
This revision also described ongoing efforts to develop the eight-hour ozone attainment 
demonstration including a new modeling episode using days from 2005 and 2006, the continued 
implementation of increasingly lower federal on-road and non-road engine standards, and further 
research and consideration of additional control strategies. 
 
The HGB 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Nonattainment Area Reasonable Further Progress SIP 
revision, also adopted by the commission on May 23, 2007, demonstrates that the reasonable 
further progress 15 percent reduction requirement would be met for the analysis period of 2002 - 

2008.  Demonstration of reasonable further progress is based on the guidelines in the second 
phase of the EPA’s 1997 eight-hour ozone implementation rule.  On April 22, 2009, the EPA 
published a direct final approval of the reasonable further progress SIP revision, its associated 
MVEBs, and the 2002 base year emissions inventory (74 FR 18298). 
 
1.2.3  Existing Ozone Control Strategies   
Existing ozone control strategies and VMEP measures, discussed in Chapter 4, Control Strategies 
and Required Elements, Section 4.2, Existing Control Measures show key control strategies for 
complying with both the one-hour and eight-hour ozone NAAQS in the HGB nonattainment area.  
Existing control strategies targeted to the one-hour standard are expected to continue to reduce 
emissions of ozone precursors in the HGB area and positively impact progress toward attainment 
of the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.  The one-hour and 1997 eight-hour ozone design values 
for the HGB area from 1991 to 2008 are illustrated in Figure 1-1:  One-Hour and 1997 Eight-
Hour Ozone Design Values and HGB Area Population.  Both design values have decreased over 
the past 18 years.  The 2008 one-hour ozone design value was 147 ppb, representing a 33 percent 
decrease from the value for 1991 (220 ppb).  The 2008 eight-hour ozone design value was 91 
ppb, a 24 percent decrease from the 1991 value of 119 ppb.  These decreases occurred despite a 
47 percent increase in area population, as shown in the Figure 1-1:  One-Hour and 1997 Eight-
Hour Ozone Design Values and HGB Area Population.

1.2.4  2010 Proposed Revision 
The EPA reclassification of the HGB area as a severe nonattainment area for the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone NAAQS became effective on October 31, 2008.  Severe nonattainment areas are required 
to attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard as expeditiously as practicable but no later than June 
15, 2019.  The state must submit a SIP revision addressing the severe ozone nonattainment area 
requirements of the FCAA by April 15, 2010. 
 

 
1-6
This SIP revision demonstrates attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS using a 
photochemical modeling analysis and a weight of evidence corroborative analysis.  This submittal 
contains proposed new state and local control measures.  The Houston-Galveston Area Council 
(H-GAC), as the regional metropolitan transportation planning agency for the HGB area, has 
identified VMEP measures and transportation control measures for NOX emission reductions. 
 
Photochemical modeling analysis demonstrates that a 25 percent reduction of the HECT cap on 
the total Harris County HRVOC allocation would contribute to attainment of the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone NAAQS by reducing the future 2018 ozone design values at all HGB monitors.  
Accordingly, this SIP revision contains a proposed 25 percent reduction in the total HECT 
allowance cap and revision of the HRVOC allocation methodology.  The HECT program will 
continue to be applicable only in Harris County. 
 
This SIP revision also contains the RACT analysis, the reasonably available control measures 
(RACM) analysis, updates to existing control measures, contingency measures, and the MVEB.  
The plan also describes ongoing technological research and development as well as future 
initiatives. 
 
The HGB Reasonable Further Progress SIP Revision for the1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Standard 
(Project No. 2009-018-SIP-NR), which demonstrates the FCAA requirement of interim 
reductions of ozone precursors through the 2019 attainment date, is being proposed in a 
concurrent action. 
 
Table 1-1:  Proposed Rule Revisions contains the project number, title, and description of 
proposed rule revisions to 30 TAC Chapters 101 and 115 that are associated with this SIP 
revision.  Additional information regarding these rule revisions is included in Chapter 4:  Control 
Strategies and Required Elements.

Eight-Hour Ozone 
Nonattainment Area 
The proposed revision to the MECT program would

nonattainment area cap by prohibiting the issuance 
of allowance allocations to major sources that did 
not submit the required Level of Activity 
Certification forms by the compliance date in 30 
TAC §101.360.  This proposed rule change would 
not reduce the current NOX cap in the HGB 
nonattainment area.

Reallocation 
The proposed revisions to the HECT program cap 
rule would propose a 25 percent reduction in the 
total HRVOC allowance cap and revisions to the 
HRVOC allocation methodology.  The HECT 
program was adopted by the commission as an 
ozone control measure for the HGB area on 
December 1, 2004.  The HECT program is 
applicable only in Harris County. 
2008-019-115-EN 
VOC Control Technique 
Guidelines (CTG) Update 
The proposed revisions to 30 TAC Chapter 115, 
Subchapter E, Division 4 would limit the VOC 
content of solvents used by offset lithographic 
printing facilities located in the HGB area and 
would implement the CTG recommendations to 
reduce the VOC content of the fountain solutions 
and cleaning materials used by such facilities.  
Additionally, the proposed revisions would expand 
the current rule applicability to include smaller 
sources not currently subject to the rule.  The 
proposed revisions are to satisfy RACT for the 
2006 federal CTG document for offset lithographic 
and letterpress printing operations. 
 
 
The commission is soliciting comments on whether it is appropriate to perform a 1997 eight-hour 
ozone MCR analysis for the HGB area, and, if so, what elements should be contained in the 
analysis.  The commission is also seeking input on the appropriate date to submit the MCR. 
 
1.3  HEALTH EFFECTS 
In 1997, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone from a one-hour to an eight-hour standard.  To 
support the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard, the EPA provided information indicating that health 
effects can occur at levels lower than the previous standard and at exposure times longer than one 
hour.  Exposure to ambient ozone can cause asthma in some people.  Repeated exposures to 
ozone can make people more susceptible to respiratory infection and lung inflammation and can 
aggravate preexisting respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis and emphysema. 
Children are at a relatively higher risk from exposure to ozone when compared to adults, since 
they breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults and because children’s respiratory 
systems are still developing.  Children also spend a considerable amount of time outdoors during 
summer and during the start of the school year (August - October) when high ozone levels are 
typically recorded.  Adults most at risk to ozone exposure are people working or exercising 
outdoors and individuals with preexisting respiratory diseases. 
1.4  STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND PUBLIC HEARINGS 
1.4.1  Local Program Control Strategy Development Meetings 
The TCEQ contracted with the H-GAC to identify possible local on-road and non-road mobile 
source control strategies.  As part of this process, stakeholder meetings were held in the HGB 
area.  Table 1-2:  H-GAC Public and Stakeholder Meeting Dates lists the stakeholder meetings 

 
1-8
held by H-GAC and its subcontractor, ENVIRON International Corporation from May 2008 
through January 2009.  These meetings gave the stakeholders and the public in the HGB area the 
opportunity to hear about and comment on the development of the local mobile source control 
strategies.

1.4.2  TCEQ SIP and Control Strategy Development Stakeholder Meetings 
The TCEQ held two identical open-participation HGB Eight-Hour Ozone SIP Stakeholder Group 
meetings to discuss concepts of potential control strategies for the eight-county HGB ozone 
nonattainment area and to hear the public’s ideas on potential rulemaking concepts and provide 
the public an overview of the development of the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP Revision  
for the 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Standard.  The meetings were held on March 25 and 26, 2008, at 
the Houston City Hall Annex.  In these meetings, the TCEQ presented attendees with an update 
on the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP Revision timeline, an update on modeling efforts, and 
a draft list of initial potential control strategy concepts for stationary, area, and mobile sources.  
The TCEQ held an additional stakeholder meeting to discuss the initial 2018 HGB modeling 
results, provide an update on the development status of the HGB SIP revision, and provide an 
update from H-GAC regarding potential local mobile source control strategies.  This meeting was 
held on November 3, 2008, at H-GAC.  Additional information on the HGB Eight-Hour Ozone 
SIP Stakeholder Group is available at: 
http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/sip/hgb_stakeholder.html. 
 
A meeting was held on May 15, 2008, at H-GAC to discuss the development of the HGB 
Attainment Demonstration SIP Revision for the 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Standard and potential 
local control measures with local governments.  Letters inviting participation were sent to the 15 
mayors of cities in the HGB area with populations greater than 20,000, the eight county judges, 
and the four Harris County commissioners.  Notification was also sent to state representatives and 
senators representing the districts in the HGB area.  Another meeting was held on July 22, 2008, 
at H-GAC to provide local governments information on the SIP revision, as well as discuss the 
process to identify potential measures that can be implemented at the local level.  For this 
meeting, 109 letters inviting participation were sent to mayors of cities in the HGB area with 
populations of 20,000 or less.

CHAPTER 2:  ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS INVENTORY (EI) DESCRIPTION 
 
2.1  INTRODUCTION 
The Air Emissions Reporting Requirements (AERR), published in the December 17, 2008, issue 
of the Federal Register (73 FR 76539), instruct states to submit EIs containing information 
regarding the emissions of criteria pollutants and criteria pollutant precursors (e.g., volatile 
organic compounds (VOC)).  EIs are critical for the efforts of state, local, and federal agencies to 
attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).   
 
EIs provide data for a variety of air quality planning tasks, including establishing baseline 
emission levels, calculating emission reduction targets, control strategy development for 
achieving required emission reductions, emission inputs into air quality simulation models, and 
tracking actual emission reductions against the established emissions growth and control budgets. 
 
This chapter discusses general EI development for each of the AERR source categories.  Chapter 
3, Photochemical Modeling details specific emissions inventories and emissions inputs developed 
for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) ozone photochemical modeling.    
 
2.1.1  EI Improvement 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) EI reflects years of continuous 
emissions data improvement, including extensive point and area source inventory reconciliation 
with ambient emissions monitoring data.  Since the Texas Air Quality Study 2000 (TexAQS 
2000), when ambient VOC concentrations were measured to be greater than EI estimates, EI 
improvements have targeted more accurate speciation and reporting of industrial VOC emissions.  
The following have significantly improved the HGB point source or area source inventory. 
 
• 
Implementation of the 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 115 highly reactive 
volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) monitoring rules improved the HGB point source 
VOC inventory with measurements required of vents, cooling towers, and the streams to 
flares in HRVOC service. 
 
• 
The Houston Advanced Research Center project H51C  
(http://www.harc.edu/Projects/AirQuality/Projects/Projects/H051C) identified thousands 
of tons of VOC flash emissions from upstream oil and gas operations in the HGB area 
that the TCEQ has added to the area source inventory. 
 
• 
A special landing loss EI was conducted that required the reporting of landing loss 
emissions from floating roof tanks.  This special inventory also required regulated entities 
in the HGB area to revise their emissions inventories back to 2002, resulting in a 
reporting increase of approximately 7,000 to 8,000 tons of VOC per year (2002-2004).  
The episodic nature of these emissions is represented in the 2005 and 2006 ozone 
modeling based on site-specific activity data. 
 
• 
A month-long hourly EI of approximately 1,200 emissions sources at 125 industrial sites 
was conducted during the TexAQS II intensive period.  These hourly data are integrated 
into the 2006 modeling episode, providing highly resolved hourly VOC and nitrogen 
oxides (NOX) emissions data for sources located in the HGB area.  Monitored emissions 
data were collected for the majority of the VOC hourly emissions and all of the NOX 
emissions rates.  Because these sources are not included in the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Acid Rain database, these hourly data present 
an opportunity to model a unique and extensive set of monitoring data that characterizes 
the time-dependent nature of industrial ozone precursor emissions.  
 

 
2-2 
• 
The TCEQ Emissions Inventory Guidelines (RG-360A), a comprehensive guidance 
document which explains all aspects of the point source EI process is updated and 
published annually.  The latest version of this document is available on the TCEQ’s Point 
Source Emissions Inventory Web site at:   
(http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/industei/psei/psei.html).  Currently, six 
technical supplements provide detailed guidance on determining emissions from 
potentially underreported VOC emissions sources such as cooling towers, flares, and 
storage tanks. 
 
 
2.2  POINT SOURCES 
Stationary point source emissions data are collected annually from sites that meet the reporting 
requirements of 30 TAC § 101.10.  These sites include, but are not limited to, refineries, chemical 
plants, bulk terminals, and utilities.  To collect the data, the TCEQ mails EI questionnaires (EIQ) 
to all sites identified as meeting the reporting requirements.  Companies are required to report 
emissions data and to provide sample calculations used to determine the emissions.  Information 
characterizing the process equipment, the abatement units, and the emission points is also 
required.  All data submitted in the EIQ are reviewed for quality assurance purposes and then 
stored in the State of Texas Air Reporting System (STARS) database.  At the end of the annual 
reporting cycle, point source emissions data are reported each year to the EPA for inclusion in the 
National Emissions Inventory (NEI). 
 
2.3  AREA SOURCES 
Area sources are stationary emission sources that are not included in the point source EI.  Similar 
area sources such as plants, facilities, equipment, and/or processes are grouped into area source 
categories including, but not limited to, vehicle refueling, architectural coatings, auto refinishing, 
dry cleaning, municipal solid waste landfills, bakeries, residential fuel combustion, structural 
fires, wildfires, and open burning.   
 
Area source categories can further be characterized by the mechanism in which their emissions 
are released into the atmosphere:  hydrocarbon evaporative emissions or fuel combustion 
emissions.  Hydrocarbon evaporative emission sources include, but are not limited to, printing 
operations, industrial coatings, degreasing solvents, house painting, gasoline service station 
underground tank filling, and vehicle refueling operations.  Fuel combustion emission sources 
include, but are not limited to, stationary source fossil fuel combustion at residences and 
businesses, outdoor burning, structural fires, and wildfires.  Since area source categories represent 
individual emission sources that are small and numerous and that have not been inventoried as 
specific point or mobile sources, the EI for an area source category is developed for a specified 
geographic area by estimating the emissions collectively.   
 
The emissions from these area source categories, with some exceptions, may be calculated by 
applying an EPA-established emission factor (emissions per unit of activity) to the appropriate 
activity or activity surrogate responsible for generating emissions.  Population is the most 
commonly used activity surrogate; examples of other activity data are the amount of gasoline sold 
in an area, employment by industry type, and acres of crop land.  Activity data for an area source 
category is obtained via surveys, research, and/or investigations.  Air emissions data from the 
different area source categories are collected, reviewed for quality assurance purposes, stored in 
the Texas Air Emissions Repository database system, and compiled to develop the statewide area 

 
2-3 
 source EI.  This area source Periodic Emissions Inventory (PEI) is reported every third year 
(triennially) to the EPA for inclusion in the NEI; the TCEQ submitted the most recent PEI for 
calendar year 2005. 
 
2.4  NON-ROAD MOBILE SOURCES 
Non-road mobile sources include vehicles, engines, and equipment used for construction, 
agriculture, transportation, recreation, and many other purposes. Non-road vehicles are also 
referred to as off-road or off-highway vehicles that do not normally operate on roads or highways. 
This broad category is comprised of a diverse collection of machines, many of which are powered 
by diesel engines. Examples of non-road mobile sources include, but are not limited to: 
agricultural equipment, commercial and industrial equipment, construction and mining 
equipment, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels. 
 
A Texas specific version of the EPA’s NONROAD 2005 model, called the Texas NONROAD 
(TexN) model, is used in calculating emissions from all non-road mobile equipment and 
recreational vehicles except aircraft, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels.  Emissions for 
these three source categories are estimated using other EPA-approved methods and guidance 
documents.  Airport emissions are calculated using the Federal Aviation Administration’s 
Emissions and Dispersion Modeling System, version 5.1.  Locomotive emission estimates for 
Texas are based on specific fuel usage data derived from railway segment level gross ton mileage 
activity (line haul locomotives) and hours of operation (yard locomotives) provided directly by 
the Class I railroad companies operating in Texas.  Data captured from the Automatic 
Identification System program is applied to the latest known emission factors to quantify 
emissions from commercial marine vessels. 
 
2.5  ON-ROAD MOBILE SOURCES  
On-road mobile sources consist of automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, and other motor vehicles 
traveling on public roadways.  Combustion-related emissions are estimated for vehicle engine 
exhaust, and evaporative hydrocarbon emissions are estimated for the fuel tank and other 
evaporative leak sources on the vehicle.  The information necessary to estimate on-road mobile 
emissions is emission factors for each vehicle type, the estimated level of vehicle activity, and 
estimated roadway speed.  
 
Emission factors were developed using the newest version of the EPA's mobile emissions factor 
model, MOBILE6.2.03.  Various inputs are provided to the model to simulate the vehicle fleet in 
each nonattainment area.  Inputs used to develop localized emission factors include vehicle 
speeds, vehicle age distributions, local meteorological conditions, type of inspection and 
maintenance program in place, and local fuel properties.  Emission factors are developed for all 
28 MOBILE6.2.03 vehicle types. 
 
The level of vehicle travel activity is developed using localized travel demand models (TDM) run 
by the Texas Transportation Institute, Texas Department of Transportation, or regional 
metropolitan planning organizations.  The TDM have been validated using a large number of 
ground counts from traffic counters placed in various locations throughout Texas.  Estimates of 
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are often calibrated to outputs from the federal Highway 
Performance Monitor System, which is a model validated using a different set of traffic counters.  
VMT is  allocated to the appropriate vehicle types using regional specific VMT mixes developed 
using ground counts and vehicle registration data. 
 

 
2-4 
Roadway speeds are needed to select the appropriate MOBILE6.2.03 emission factors. Roadway 
speeds are calculated by a post-processor to the TDM.  The speed models use roadway capacity 
information, the estimated volumes from the TDM, and speed correlations based upon volume to 
capacity ratios to estimate roadway speeds. 
 
To develop on-road mobile emissions estimates, the speed specific MOBILE6.2.03 emission 
factors are multiplied by the VMT for each roadway link in the TDM network.

3.1  INTRODUCTION 
This chapter describes modeling conducted in support of the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) 
Attainment Demonstration State Implementation Plan (SIP) Revision for the 1997 Eight-Hour 
Ozone Standard.  The HGB nonattainment area consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, 
Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties.  The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act 
(FCAA) amendments require that attainment demonstrations be based on photochemical grid 
modeling or any other analytical methods determined by the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) to be at least as effective.  The EPA’s April 2007 “Guidance on the Use 
of Models and Other Analyses for Demonstrating Attainment of Air Quality Goals for Ozone, 
PM2.5, and Regional Haze” (EPA, 2007; hereafter referred to as “modeling guidance”) 
recommends new procedures for determining whether a control strategy package will lead t

The current modeling guidance recommends several qualitative methods for preparing attainment 
demonstrations that acknowledge the limitations and uncertainties of photochemical models when 
used to project ozone concentrations into future years.  First, the guidance recommends using 
model results in a relative sense and applying the model response to the observed ozone data.  
Second, the guidance recommends using available air quality, meteorology, and emissions data to 
develop a conceptual model for eight-hour ozone formation and to use that analysis in episode 
selection.  Third, the guidance recommends using other analyses (Weight of Evidence) to 
supplement and co

The 1990 FCAA amendments established five classifications for ozone nonattainment areas 
based on the magnitude of the monitored one-hour ozone design values and established dates by 
which each classified area should attain the NAAQS.  Based on the monitored one-hour ozone 
design value at that time, the HGB Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (Brazoria, 
Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller counties) was 
classified severe-17, with an attainment date of November 15, 2007.  Dating back to 1990, there 
have been six SIP revisions with supporting photochemical modeling addressing the one-hour 
ozone NAAQS.  The most recent one-hour ozone HGB SIP r

With the change of the ozone NAAQS from a one-hour standard to an eight-hour standard, in 
April 2004, the EPA classified the HGB area as a moderate ozone nonattainment area with an 
attainment date of June 15, 2010.  Ozone SIP revisions addressing the eight-hour ozone standard 
were due June 15, 2007.  Ozone modeling and other analyses conducted by the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for the SIP revision resulted in a determination 
that it was not p

Therefore, the ozone SIP revision submitted to EPA on June 15, 2007, included a request to 
reclassify the area as severe nonattainment for the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS, with an 
attainment date of June 15, 2019.  Because the attainment date is early in the 2019 ozone season, 
the EPA has prescribed that the modeling attainment test be app

This attainment demonstration uses photochemical modeling in combination with corroborative 
analyses primarily associated with the 2000 and 2006 Texas Air Quality Studies (TexAQS 2000 
and TexAQS II, respectively) to support a conclusion that the HGB eight-county nonattainment 
area will attain the 0.08 parts per million (ppm) 1997 eight-hour ozone standard by June 15, 2019.

3.1.1  Overview of the Ozone Photochemical Modeling Process 
The modeling system is composed of a meteorological model, several emissions processing 
models, and a photochemical air quality model. 
p
 
Ozone is a secondary pollutant; it is not generally emitted directly into the atmosphere.  Ozone is 
created in the atmosphere by a complex set of chemical reactions between sunlight and several 
primary (directly emitted) pollutants.  The reactions are photochemical and require ultraviolet 
energy from sunlight.  The primary pollutants fall into two groups, nitrogen oxides (NOX) and 
volatile organic compounds (VOC).  In addition, carbon monoxide (CO) is also an ozone 
precursor, but much less effective than either NOX or VOC in forming ozone.  As a result of these 
multiple factors, higher concentrations of ozone are most common during the summer 
co
  
Ozone chemistry is complex, involving hundreds of chemical compounds and chemical reactions.  
As a result, ozone cannot be evaluated using simple dilution and dispersion algorithms.  Due to 
this chemical complexity, the modeling guidance strongly recommends using photochemical 
computer models to simulate ozone formation and evaluate the effectiveness of future control 
strategies.  Computer simulations are the
c
 
3.1.2  Ozone Modeling 
Ozone modeling involves two major phases, the base case modeling phase and the future year 
modeling phase (with substeps in each phase).  The purpose of the base case modeling phase is to 
evaluate the model’s ability to adequately replicate measured ozone and ozone precursor 
concentrations during recent periods with high ozone concentrations (base case episodes).  The 
purpose of the future year modeling phase is to predict attainment year ozone design values, as 
well as evaluate the effectiveness of controls in reaching attainment.  The TCEQ developed a 
modeling protocol (plan) describing the process to be
a
 
3.1.3  Base Case Modeling 
Base case modeling involves several steps.  First, recent episodes are analyzed to determine what 
factors were associated with ozone formation in the area and whether those factors were 
consistent with the conceptual model.  In consultation with the Southeast Texas Photochemical 
Modeling Technical Committee (SETPMTC), which serves in an advisory role for the technical 
aspects of applying
e
 
The next step is to generate and quality-assure the emissions and meteorological data for the 
selected episodes.  Then the meteorological and emissions (NOX, VOC and CO) data are input to 
the photochemical model and the ozone photochemistry is simulated, resulting in predicted ozone 
and ozone precursor concentrations.  Base case modeling results are evaluated by comparing 
them to the observed measurements of ozone and ozone precursors.  Typically this step is an 
iterative process incorporating feedback from successive evaluations to ensure that the model is 
adequately replicating observations throughout the modeling episode.  The adequacy of the model 
in replicating observations is assessed based on compliance with statistical and graphical 
measures as recommended in the modeling guidance.  In addition to the recommended analyses, 
the TCEQ used the TexAQS II observations to extend its model performance evaluation to areas 
and chemical species not normally monitored.  This extended analysis included use of monitoring 
data collected on aircraft and ship-based platforms.  Satisfactory performance of the base case

3.1.4  Future Year Modeling 
Future year modeling involves several steps.  The procedure for predicting future year ozone 
design values (attainment test) involves determining the ratio of the future year to the baseline 
year modeled ozone concentrations.  This ratio is called the relative response factor (RRF).  
Whereas the emissions data for the base case modeling are episode-specific, the emissions data 
for the baseline year are based on typical ozone season emissions.  Similarly, the emissions data 
for the future year are developed applying growth and control factors to the baseline year 
emissions.  The growth an

Both the baseline and future years are modeled using their respective ozone season emissions and

The future year ozone design value is calculated by multiplying the RRF by a baseline year ozone 
design value (DVB).  The DVB is the average of the regulatory design values for the three 
consecutive years containing the baseline year (see Figure 3-1:  Baseline Design Value 
Calculation Illustration).  When the calculated future year ozone design value is less than or 
equal to 0.08 ppm (84 parts per billion (ppb)), this signifies modeled attainment.  When the

Hourly average resultant winds are plotted in the figure.  The x-axis represents the east-west 
component of the wind while the y-axis represents the north-south component.  Each point on the 
loop represents an hour of the day.  The red data point corresponds to midnight and the aqua point 
corresponds to noon.  Wind vectors have two attributes, wind speed and direction, and these 
components were averaged across monitors for each hour of the day and then plotted.  Each point 
represents the tail of that hour’s averaged resultant wind vector, and although not plotted, all the 
resultant wind vectors terminate at the origin.  In other words, the direction from the point to the 
origin represents the direct
th
one-hour vectors, and the green halo around each point gives an indication of the variability of 
the data across monitors.

Even though there are 52 exceedance days in the 2005 and 2006 episodes, only a few of the 
regulatory monitors measured daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentrations of greater than 84 
ppb on 10 or more days.  This reflects the complexity of ozone formation and distribution in the 
HGB area.  For example, the Houston Texas Avenue (HTCA, CAMS 411) and TCEQ Houston 
Regional Office (HROC, CAMS 81) monitors are in fairly close proximity to one another, but the 
Houston Texas Avenue (CAMS 411) monitor measured a daily maximum eight-hour ozone 
concentration of greater than 84 ppb on only one day, while the TCEQ Houston Regional Office 
(CAMS 81) monitor measured it on nine days.  The attainment test considers the modeled daily 
maximum eight-hour ozone concentration from an array of grid cells around the cell containing a 
monitor.  By considering an array of grid cells around the monitor, rather than the single grid cell 
where the monitor is located, the likelihood of modeled concentrations exceeding 84 ppb is 
increased.  This increases the number of days used in the attainment test (i.e., the RRF calculation). 
 
There were a few other ozone episodes during the 2005 and 2006 ozone season that were not 
developed due to unusual meteorological conditions.  For example, exceedance days that occurred 
in late August and September of 2005 may have been influenced by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

3.3  METEOROLOGICAL MODEL 
The TCEQ is using the Fifth Generation Meteorological Model (MM5, version 3.7.3) developed 
jointly by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Pennsylvania State 
University (Grell et al., 1994).  This model, supported by a broad user community including the 
Air Force Weather Agency, national laboratories, and academia, is being used extensively for 
regulatory air quality modeling analyses throughout the United States. 
 
3.3.1  Modeling Domains 
MM5 was configured with three two-way nested outer grids (108 kilometer (km), 36 km, and 12 
km horizontal resolution) to cover the United States and regional areas of interest.  A one-way 
nested 4 km fine grid covering the eastern half of Texas was used to focus on metropolitan areas 
with air quality degradation, as shown in Figure 3-7:  MM5 Modeling Domains.  The extent of each 
of the MM5 modeling domains was selected to accommodate the embedding of the commensurate 
air quality modeling domains (see Section 3.5:  PHOTOCHEMICAL MODELING). 
 
Vertically, MM5 is structured with 43 layers from the surface to approximately 20 km.  Twenty 
layers are within the first 3,000 meters in order to resolve boundary layer phenomena.  The same 
MM5 vertical layering structure is used for all of the domains.

3.3.2  Model (MM5) Configuration 
Based on past TCEQ modeling efforts, the EPA’s modeling guidance (EPA, 2007), contractor 
experience, and other demonstrations including sensitivity tests and model performance evaluation, 
the MM5 was configured with parameterizations and improved input data to optimize the 
performance of the wind field (i.e., wind speed and direction).  Wind speed and direction are the

To improve the MM5 simulation of the meteorological parameters, in particular the wind field, the 
land use characteristics and sea surface temperatures on all domains were updated with high 
resolution satellite measurements.  In addition, observed parameters are assimilated in MM5 during 
the model run through a process called Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (FDDA), or nudging 
(Stauffer and Seaman, 1990; Stauffer et al., 1991; Stauffer and Seaman, 1994).  The outer domains 
(108 km, 36 km, and 12 km) were nudged to the National Center for Environmental Prediction 
(NCEP) North American Model (NAM) gridded output for winds, temperature, and water vapor.  
The fine scale 4 km domain was observationally nudged using quality-assured upper air wind 
profiler data.  MM5 default nudging strength parameters were used for both the NAM and profile

A detailed performance evaluation for each of the 2005 and 2006 meteorological modeling 
episodes is included in Appendix A:  Meteorological Modeling for the HGB Attainment 
Demonstration SIP.  In addition, all performance evaluation products are available on the TCEQ 
file transfer protocol (FTP) site (TCEQ, 2009). 
 
As mentioned, the wind speed and direction are deemed to be the most important meteorological 
parameters input to the air quality model.  The MM5 modeled wind field was evaluated by 
comparing the hourly modeled and measured wind speed and direction for all monitors in the HGB 
area.  Figure 3-8:  Meteorological Modeling Performance exhibits the percent of hours for which 
the average absolute difference between the modeled and measured wind speed and direction, for 
all monitors in the HGB area, was within the specified accuracy benchmarks (e.g., wind speed less 
than or equal to two meters per second: WSPD < 2 m/s).

3.4  MODELING EMISSIONS 
For the stationary emission source types, which consist of point and area sources, routine emission 
inventories provided the major inputs for the emissions modeling processing.  Emissions from 
mobile and biogenic sources were derived from relevant emission models.  Specifically, link-based 
on-road mobile source emissions were derived from a travel demand model coupled with the EPA 
MOBILE6.2 emission factor model, and non-road mobile source emissions were derived from the 
EPA’s National Mobile Inventory Model (NMIM), or the Texas NONROAD (TexN) mobile 
source models.  The on- and non-road emissions were processed to air quality model-ready using 
version three of the Emissions Processing System (EPS3; Environ, 2007).  Biogenic emissions 
were derived from the Global Biosphere Emissions and Interactions System (GloBEIS) model, 
which outputs air quality model-ready emissions. 
 
Appendix B:  Emissions Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP provides details on 
the development and processing of the emissions using the various EPS3 modules.  The modules, 
listed in Table 3-6:  EPS3 Emissions Processing Modules are used to create the chemically 
speciated, temporally (hourly) allocated, and spatially distributed emission files needed for the air 
quality model.

The following sections give a brief description of the development of each type of emissions. 
 
3.4.1  Biogenic Emissions 
The TCEQ used Version 3.1 of the GloBEIS model to develop the biogenic emissions.  It 
incorporates detailed locality-specific land-use data to generate the mix and density of vegetative 
species.  In addition, solar radiation data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 
(GOES) imagery, which is used to generate the photosynthetically active solar radiation (PAR), can 
be input to the GloBEIS model.  Further, the GloBEIS model can accept hourly temperature data 
generated from weather station data. 
 
Biogenic Emissions Landuse Data,Version 3 (BELD3; Kinnee et al., 1997), a vegetation database 
for the entire North American continent prepared specifically for creating biogenic emissions 
inventories, was used for the 36 km domain and the portion of the 12 km domain outside Texas.  
For the land-use data in the 12 km domain within Texas, the TCEQ used the Texas vegetation 
database (Wiedinmyer et al., 2001), which was derived from Texas Parks and Wildlife vegetation 
data and agricultural statistics from the National Agricultural Statistics Survey, and field surveys 
carried out in 1999.  Within the 4 km nested domain, a new land-cover database from the 
University of Texas Center for Space Research (UT-CSR) was used (Feldman et al., 2007).  This 
database was developed from classification of recent Landsat 7 data, Shuttle Radar Topography 
Mission and National Elevation datasets to identify wetlands, and United States Department of 
Agriculture, Common Land Unit CLU data to identify agricultural land. 
 
The episode-specific PAR data input to GloBEIS were obtained from the website operated by the 
Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project 
(GCIP) 
and 
GEWEX 
Americas 
Prediction 
Project 
(GAPP) 
located 
at 
http://metosrv2.umd.edu/~srb/gcip/cgi-bin/historic.cgi?auth=no.  The episode-specific temperature 
data were obtained from weather stations throughout the United States, including data from the 
National Weather Service, the EPA Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) air quality 
database, the National Buoy Data Center, the Texas A&M Crop Weather Program, the Louisiana 
Agricultural Information Service, and the Texas Coastal Oceanographic Observation Network.   
 
GloBEIS3.1 was run for each of the modeling episode days listed in Table 3-7: 2005 and 2006 
Episode Days for Emissions Modeling.  Figure 3-9:  An Example of Day-Specific Biogenic 
Emissions shows the typical magnitude and distribution of biogenic VOC and NOX emissions in 
the 4 km modeling domain.

Since biogenic emissions are associated with meteorological features, the same episode day-
specific emissions were used as input for the 2006 baseline and 2018 future air quality modeling. 
 
3.4.2  Base Cases 
3.4.2.1  Point Sources 
Point source modeling emissions were developed using data from regional inventories such as the 
Central Regional Air Planning Association/Regional Planning Organization (CENRAP/RPO) 
emissions database and EPA’s Acid Rain Database (ARD), state inventories including the State of 
Texas Air Reporting System (STARS), and local inventories including the TexAQS II Hourly 
Special Inventory (SI).  Data were processed with EPS3 to generate model-ready emissions, and 
similar procedures were used to develop each base case episode. 
 
Outside Texas 
Point source emissions data for the regions of the modeling domains outside Texas were obtained 
from a number of different sources.  Emissions from point sources in the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., oil 
and gas production platforms) were obtained from the 2005 Gulf-wide Emissions Inventory 
(GWEI) provided by the Minerals Management Services (MMS) as monthly totals.  The Canadian 
emissions were obtained from EPA modeling emission files developed for the 2001 Clean Air 
Interstate Rule (CAIR) base case analysis (EPA, 2005) and the Mexican emissions inventory data 
were obtained from Phase III of the Mexican National Emissions Inventory (NEI; 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/mexico.html).   
 
For all states beyond Texas, hourly NOX emissions for major electric generating units (EGUs) were 
obtained from the ARD for each episode day.  Emissions for non-ARD sources in states beyond 
Texas were obtained from the 2002 CENRAP/RPO emissions database, with the exception of 

 
3-18 
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  State-specific 2005 point source annual emissions for non-
ARD sources were provided by Arkansas and Oklahoma.  Louisiana provided their 2004 point 
source emissions, since the 2005 emissions were incomplete due to hurricane Katrina.  The EPA’s 
Economic Growth Analysis System Version 5.0 (EGAS5) was used to grow these emissions to 
2005 and 2006 as appropriate for the various episodes.  
 
Within Texas 
Hourly NOX emissions from EGUs within Texas were obtained from the ARD for each episode day.  
Emissions from non-ARD sources were obtained from the TCEQ 2005 and 2006 STARS emissions 
inventories.  The 2006 TexAQS II hourly special inventory (SI) collected August 15 through 
September 15, 2006, was used for the August/September 2006 episode (bc06aqs1).  In addition, 
agricultural and forest fire emissions for the 2005 and 2006 episodes were obtained from a TCEQ-
funded study (Environ, 2008b), which treated fires as point sources.  For the HGB area, 2005 and 
2006 event-specific tank landing loss emissions were obtained from an SI revision requested by the 
TCEQ.  Highly Reactive Volatile Organic Compounds (HRVOC) (ethylene (ETH), propylene, 
butenes and 1,3-butadiene) emissions were reconciled with ambient measurements by comparing 
concentrations observed at automated gas chromatographs (auto-GCs) in the area with 
concentrations expected at those locations based on the reported inventory. See Appendix B:  
Emissions Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP for more details.  
 
Table 3-8:  2005 and 2006 Base Case Episode Point Source Modeling Emissions for HGB

3.4.2.2  On-Road Mobile Sources 
On-road mobile source modeling emissions were developed using the EPA’s NMIM, and Highway 
Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) data and travel demand modeling (TDM) output coupled 
with the EPA MOBILE6.2 emissions model.  The output from these emission modeling 
applications were processed through EPS3 to generate the air quality model-ready on-road mobile 
source emission files. 
 
Outside Texas 
For all of the states beyond Texas, the TCEQ used NMIM to generate average summer weekday 
mobile source emissions by county for 2005 and 2006.  Average summer Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday mobile source emissions were estimated using the weekday to Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday ratios developed for the on-road mobile source emissions within Texas. 
 
Within Texas 
For the Texas counties outside of HGB and Beaumont-Port Arthur (BPA) areas, on-road emissions 
were developed by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) using HPMS data for 2005 and 2006, 
and the EPA’s MOBILE6.2 on-road mobile source emissions model to generate average summer 
emissions for the four day types of weekday (Monday through Thursday average), Friday, Saturday, 
and Sunday.  
 
For the eight-county HGB and three-county BPA areas, link-based on-road emission were 
developed by TTI using the TDM output for 2005 and 2006, and the EPA MOBILE6.2 on-road 
mobile source emissions model to generate average summer and school season on-road emission 

 
3-20 
for the four day types.  For the 2005 and 2006 base case episodes, both the school and summer 
season day type emissions were used as appropriate.

3.4.2.3  Non- and Off-Road Mobile Sources 
Non/Off-road mobile source modeling emissions were developed using the EPA NMIM, the EPA 
NEI, TexN, and data from the TCEQ’s Texas Air Emissions Repository (TexAER).  The output 
from these emission modeling applications and databases were processed through EPS3 to generate 
the air quality model-ready non- and off-road mobile source emission files. 
 
Outside Texas 
For all the states beyond Texas, the TCEQ used the EPA’s NMIM.  NMIM generates average 
summer weekday non-road mobile source category emissions by county and was run for 2005 and 
2006.  For the off-road mobile source categories (aircraft, locomotive, and marine) in the non-
Texas states, the TCEQ used the EPA’s 2002 NEI with EGAS5 growth factors and national 
controls for locomotives and marine vessels to generate 2005 and 2006 average summer weekday 
off-road mobile source category emissions.  Summer weekend day emissions for the non- and off-
road mobile source categories were developed as part of the EPS3 processing using category 
specific weekly activity profiles. 
 
Within Texas 
The TCEQ used the TexN model to generate average summer weekday non-road mobile source 
category emissions by county for 2005 and 2006.  County-level off-road emissions for 2005 were 
obtained from the TCEQ’s 2005 TexAER, and the 2006 county-level off-road emissions were 
estimated by adjusting the 2005 TexAER emissions with the Texas-specific Regional Economic 
Models, Inc. (REMI)-EGAS growth factors, except for the aircraft/airport emissions in the HGB 
and DFW areas.  The 2005 and 2006 aircraft/airport emissions in the HGB and DFW areas were 
provided through a stakeholder process and these emissions are airport-specific rather than county-
level.  Summer weekend day emissions for the non- and off-road mobile source categories were 
developed as part of the EPS3 processing using category specific weekly activity profiles. 
  
Table 3-11:  2005 and 2006 Base Case Episode Non- and Off-Road Modeling Emissions for HGB 
summarizes the non- and off-road mobile source weekday emissions for each of the 2005 and 2006 
base case episodes for the eight-county HGB area.  Since these are average summer weekday, the 
2005 emissions are used for each of the 2005 base case episodes and the 2006 emissions are used 
for each of the 2006 base case episodes.

3.4.2.4  Area Sources 
Area source modeling emissions were developed using the EPA NEI and the TCEQ TexAER.  The 
emissions information in these databases was processed through EPS3 to generate the air quality 
model-ready area source emission files. 
 
Outside Texas 
For all the states beyond Texas, the TCEQ used the EPA’s 2002 NEI with EGAS5 growth factors 
to generate 2005 and 2006 daily area source emissions. 
 
Within Texas 
The TCEQ used 2005 TexAER to generate 2005 daily area source emissions and for the 2006 daily 
area source emissions, applied the Texas-specific REMI-EGAS growth factors. 
 
Since these are daily emissions, the 2005 emissions are used for each of the 2005 base case 
episodes and the 2006 emissions are used for each of the 2006 base case episodes.

5.  VOC is reported as sum of CB05 species 
 
 

 
3-23 
3.4.3  2006 Baseline 
In general, the baseline modeling emissions are based on typical ozone season emissions, whereas 
the base case modeling emissions are episode day-specific.  The biogenic emissions are an 
exception in that the same episode day-specific emissions are used in the 2006 baseline and base 
cases.  In addition, the 2006 baseline non- and off-road and area source modeling emissions are the 
same as used for the 2006 base case episodes, since they are based on typical ozone season 
emissions.  No fire emissions were included in the 2006 baseline. 
 
3.4.3.1  Point Sources 
For the non-ARD point sources, the 2006 baseline emissions are the same as the modeling 
emissions used for the June 2006 (bc06ep0) and the bc06aqs2 episodes.  The 2006 baseline ARD 
sources EGUs emissions were estimated using the average of the 2006 third quarter hourly ARD 
emissions.  The 2006 baseline tank landing emissions were estimated as the average of the tank 
landing emissions for those 2006 episode days with non-zero emissions.  The HRVOC emissions 
reconciliation developed for the 2006 base cases was used for the 2006 baseline.  For the Gulf of 
Mexico, Canada, and Mexico, the 2006 baseline uses the same emissions as the base cases. 
 
3.4.3.2  On-Road Mobile Sources 
The 2006 baseline on-road mobile source emissions are the same as used for the June 2006 
(bc06ep0) base case episode.  These are the summer season modeling emissions for each of the day 
types, weekday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
 
3.4.4  2018 Future Base and Control Strategy 
The biogenic emissions used for the 2018 future base and control strategy modeling are the same 
episode day-specific emissions used in the base cases.  In addition, similar to the 2006 baseline, no 
fire emissions were included in the 2018 future base and control strategy modeling. 
 
3.4.4.1  Point Sources 
Outside Texas 
The non-ARD point source emissions data in the regions outside Texas were obtained from the 
2018 CENRAP/RPO regional haze SIP.  For the Gulf, Canada, and Mexico, the 2018 emissions are 
the same as used in the 2006 baseline.  The CAIR Phase 2 emission levels were used for the EGU 
2018 emissions, with an adjustment for the ozone season.  The ozone season adjustment was 
developed using the ratio of the average of the 2006 third quarter hourly ARD emissions to the 
annual average ARD emissions. 
 
Within Texas 
Emissions for the non-ARD point sources were projected to 2018 using the larger of the Texas 
Industrial Production Index (TIPI) or Texas-specific REMI EGAS growth factors (or banked 
Emissions Reduction Credits and Discrete Emissions Reduction Credits in nonattainment areas).  
Controls pertinent to existing HGB, DFW, and BPA SIP revisions were applied to appropriate 
point source categories (e.g., Mass Emissions Cap and Trade program (MECT), HRVOC 
Emissions Cap and Trade program (HECT), and East Texas Combustion Rule).  The 2018 future 
base emissions for HECT-applicable point sources in Harris County used their HECT allocations.  
The 2018 control strategy includes a 25 percent reduction (2.69 tpd) to the HECT cap for 
applicable point sources in Harris County.  
 
Similar to the 2018 emissions for ARD sources outside Texas, the ARD sources within Texas used 
the CAIR Phase 2 emissions adjusted to the ozone season, with the exception of ARD sources in 
the eight-county HGB area, which are subject to the MECT rule.  The 2018 emissions for ARD 
sources within the HGB area used the MECT allocations adjusted to the ozone season, similar to 
the adjustment for the ARD sources in the non-HGB area.  Newly-permitted ARD sources were 
limited to the CAIR 9.5 percent set-aside for growth.  The 2018 tank landing emissions were the 

 
3-24 
same as the 2006 baseline, but the HRVOC reconciliation was reduced by the amount in Harris 
County associated with HECT applicable source categories. 
 
For the eight-county HGB area, the point source NOX emissions are reduced by about 5 percent 
from the 2006 baseline (172.16 tpd) to the 2018 future base (162.75 tpd) and the VOC emissions 
are increased about 48 percent from the 2006 baseline (208.34 tpd) to the 2018 future base (309.46 
tpd).  The 25 percent HECT control strategy reduces the 2018 control strategy VOC emissions to 
306.75 tpd. 
 
3.4.4.2  On-Road Mobile Sources 
Outside Texas 
The TCEQ used the EPA’s NMIM to generate average summer weekday mobile source emissions 
by county for 2018 for all of the states beyond Texas.  Average summer Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday mobile source emissions were estimated using the weekday to Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday ratios developed for the on-road mobile source emissions within Texas. 
 
Within Texas 
For the Texas counties outside of the HGB and BPA areas, summer season, day type, non-link on-
road emissions were developed by TTI using 2018 projected traffic data and the EPA’s 
MOBILE6.2.  For the eight-county HGB and three-county BPA (Jefferson, Hardin, and Orange) 
areas, link-based on-road emissions were developed by TTI using the TDM output projected for 
2018, and the EPA’s MOBILE6.2 on-road mobile source emissions model to generate average 
summer season on-road emissions for the four day types.  The 2018 control strategy includes a 1.55 
tpd Voluntary Mobile Emission Reduction Program (VMEP) NOX reduction to the on-road mobile 
sources for alternative commuting, vehicle retrofit and replacement, and traffic flow improvement 
measures.   
 
For the eight-county HGB area, the on-road mobile source NOX emissions are reduced by about 74 
percent from the 2006 baseline (197.28 tpd) to the 2018 future base (50.76 tpd) and the VOC 
emissions are decreased about 49 percent from the 2006 baseline (99.39 tpd) to the 2018 future 
base (50.39 tpd).  The VMEP control strategies reduce the 2018 control strategy NOX emissions to 
49.21 tpd. 
 
3.4.4.3  Non- and Off-Road Mobile Sources 
Outside Texas 
For the states outside of Texas, the TCEQ used the EPA’s NMIM to generate average summer 
weekday non-road mobile source category emissions by county for 2018.  For the off-road mobile 
source categories, aircraft, locomotive, and marine, in the states beyond Texas, the TCEQ used the 
EPA’s 2002 NEI with EGAS5 growth factors and national controls for locomotives and marine 
vessels to generate 2018 average summer weekday off-road mobile source category emissions.  
Summer weekend day emissions for the non- and off-road mobile source categories were 
developed as part of the EPS3 processing using category specific weekly activity profiles. 
 
Within Texas 
The TCEQ used the TexN model to generate average summer weekday non-road mobile source 
category emissions by county for 2018.  2018 county-level off-road emissions were estimated by 
adjusting the 2005 TexAER emissions with the Texas-specific REMI-EGAS growth factors, except 
for the aircraft/airport emissions in the HGB and DFW areas and marine vessels in HGB and BPA.  
The 2018 aircraft/airport emissions in the HGB and DFW areas were provided through a 
stakeholder process and these emissions are airport-specific rather than county-level.  The 2018 
emissions for marine vessels in HGB and BPA were developed using emission trends provided by 
the HGB and BPA Port Authorities (Starcrest, 2000).  Summer weekend day emissions for the non- 
and off-road mobile source categories were developed as part of the EPS3 processing using 
category specific weekly activity profiles. 

 
3-25 
 
For the eight-county HGB area, the non- and off-road mobile source NOX emissions are reduced by 
about 20 percent from the 2006 baseline (152.40 tpd) to the 2018 future base (121.37 tpd) and the 
VOC emissions are decreased about 19 percent from the 2006 baseline (82.02 tpd) to the 2018 
future base (66.49 tpd).  The 2018 control strategy includes 0.70 tpd NOX reduction to non-road 
VMEP measures. 
 
3.4.4.4  Area Sources 
Outside Texas 
The TCEQ obtained emissions data used in the 2018 regional haze SIP revision that was created by 
the CENRAP/RPO for all the states beyond Texas.  
 
Within Texas 
The 2018 county-level area source emissions were estimated by adjusting the 2005 TexAER 
emissions with the Texas-specific REMI-EGAS growth factors, except for the flash emissions 
category.  Flash emissions will be controlled in the future as a result of the Storage Vessel and 
Degassing rule (30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 115), so no growth was applied and 
the same emissions were used for the 2018 future base and control strategy as the 2006 baseline. 
 
For the eight-county HGB area, the area source NOX emissions are increased by about 16 percent 
from the 2006 baseline (36.35 tpd) to the 2018 future base (42.04 tpd) and the VOC emissions are 
increased about 23 percent from the 2006 baseline (528.99 tpd) to the 2018 future base (650.09 
tpd).

3.5  PHOTOCHEMICAL MODELING 
To ensure that a modeling study can be successfully used as technical support for an attainment 
demonstration SIP revision, the air quality model must be scientifically sound and appropriate for 
the intended application and freely accessible to all stakeholders.  In a regulatory environment, it is 
crucial that oversight groups (e.g., the EPA), the regulated community, and the interested public 
have access to and also be convinced of the suitability of the model.  The following three 
prerequisites were identified for selecting the air quality model to be used in the HGB attainment 
demonstration: 
 

 
3-27 
• 
must have a reasonably current, peer-reviewed, scientific formulation; 
• 
must be available at no or low cost to stakeholders; and 
• 
must be consistent with air quality models being used for other Texas nonattainment or 
near nonattainment areas. 
 
The only model to meet all three of these criteria is CAMx.  The model is based on well-
established treatments of advection, diffusion, deposition, and chemistry.  Another important 
feature is that NOX emissions from large point sources can be treated with the PiG submodel, 
which helps avoid the artificial diffusion that occurs when point source emissions are introduced 
into a grid volume.  The model software and the CAMx user's guide are publicly available at 
http://www.camx.com (Environ, 2009).  In addition, the TCEQ has many years of experience with 
CAMx.  CAMx was used for the modeling conducted in the DFW and BPA nonattainment areas, 
as well as for modeling being conducted in other areas of Texas (e.g., San Antonio). 
 
CAMx Version 4.53 was used for this modeling study.  Some of the features in this version include 
the ability to process in parallel on multiple processors and the following probing tools for 
sensitivity analysis: 
 
• 
Process Analysis, which provides in depth details of ozone formation, showing the various 
physical and chemical processes that determine the modeled ozone concentrations at 
specified locations and times; 
• 
Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT), which estimates the contribution of 
emissions from multiple geographical areas and source categories to ozone formation 
(including biogenic emissions); and 
• 
Anthropogenic Precursor Culpability Assessment (APCA), which reallocates ozone 
apportioned to non-controllable biogenic emissions to the controllable portion of 
precursors that participated in ozone formation. 
 
3.5.1  Modeling Domains and Horizontal Grid Cell Size 
Figure 3-11:  CAMx Modeling Domains depicts the modeling domains used in CAMx.  The 
horizontal configuration of the CAMx modeling domains consist of a 2 km x 2 km grid (2 km) 
encompassing a major portion of the HGB nonattainment counties (red box), nested within a 4 km 
x 4 km grid (4 km) encompassing both the HGB and BPA counties (blue box), nested within a 12 
km x 12 km grid (12 km) covering the eastern part of Texas (green box), nested within the outer 
(black box) 36 km x 36 km grid (36km).  The 36 km outer domain was selected to minimize the 
effect of boundary conditions on predicted ozone concentrations. 
 

 
3-28 
Figure 3-11:  CAMx Modeling Domains 
 
 
All grids align with the grid developed by the EPA for nationwide modeling for regional haze and 
particulate matter.  Choosing a grid system compatible with an existing large-scale grid system 
serves several functions, including ability to use ready-made regional inventory data directly, 
ability to integrate the TCEQ’s modeling into regional modeling projects, and promoting 
consistency among various regional and urban modeling applications in the central United States. 
 
A finer resolution subdomain within the 4 km HGB-BPA domain better replicates the emission 
gradients in the narrow industrial plumes emanating from the Ship Channel and surrounding areas.   

 
3-29 
3.5.2  Vertical Layer Structure 
The vertical configuration of the CAMx modeling domains consists of 28 layers of varying depth 
used with the 2 km and 4 km domains, and 17 layers of varying depth used with the 12 km and 36 
km horizontal domains.  The unique meteorology induced by the land/sea/bay effects and the 
diverse mixture of industrial source types, which release pollutants across a wide range of 
elevations, require more vertical layers, particularly near ground level, in the fine-grid domains.  
Table 3-14:  CAMx Vertical Layer Structure for 2 km and 4 km Fine Grids and Table 3-15:  CAMx 
Vertical Layer Structure for Intermediate and Coarse Grids show the vertical structuring of the 28-
layered and 17-layered configurations, respectively.

3.5.3  Model Configuration 
The TCEQ used CAMx version 4.53, which includes a number of upgrades and features from 
previous versions.  The following CAMx 4.53 options were employed: 
• 
Parallel processing of the chemistry and transport algorithms; 
• 
CB05 chemical mechanism with Euler Backward Iterative (EBI) chemistry solver; 
• 
Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) advection solver; 
• 
Flexi-nesting to interpolate the 4 km meteorological parameters to the 2 km CAMx 
domain; and 
• 
PiG treatment of larger point sources of NOX using the Greatly Reduced Execution and 
Simplified Dynamics (GREASD) Lagrangian module. 
 
In addition to the CAMx inputs developed from the meteorological and emissions modeling, inputs 
are needed for initial and boundary conditions, spatially resolved surface characteristic parameters, 
spatially resolved albedo/haze/ozone (i.e., opacity) and photolysis rates, and a chemistry 
parameters file. 
 
The TCEQ contracted with Environ (Environ, 2008b) who worked with National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to derive episode-specific 
boundary conditions from the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART) global 
air quality model.  Boundary conditions were developed for each grid cell along all four edges of 
the 36 km domain (number of horizontal grid cells [69 or 67 for east-west or north-south edges, 
respectively] times the number of vertical layers [17]) for each episode hour.  This work also 
produced initial conditions for each of the episodes.  The TCEQ used these episode-specific initial 
and boundary conditions for this modeling study.  The top-boundary conditions were set at the 
clean concentration levels as previously derived by Environ and used in the recently approved 
DFW Ozone Attainment Demonstration SIP revision (TCEQ, 2007). 
 
Surface characteristic parameters, including roughness, vegetative distribution, and water/land 
boundaries, are input to CAMx via a land-use file.  The land-use file provides the fractional 
contribution (0 to 1) of eleven land-use categories, as defined by the United States Geological 
Survey (USGS) LULC database.  For the 36 km and 12 km domains, the TCEQ used the land-use 
files developed by Environ for the DFW SIP revision approved by the EPA in 2009, which were 

 
3-31 
derived from the most recent USGS LULC database.  For the 2 km domain and portions of the 4 
km domain, in the vicinity of HGB, the TCEQ used updated land-use files developed by Texas 
A&M University (Popescu et al., 2008), which were derived from more highly resolved LULC data 
collected by the Texas Forest Service and the UT-CSR. 
 
The spatially-resolved opacity and photolysis rates are input to CAMx via a photolysis rates file 
and an opacity file, which are specific to the chemistry parameters file for the CB05 mechanism, 
which is also input to CAMx.  The TCEQ used episode-specific satellite data from the Total Ozone 
Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) to prepare the photolysis rates and opacity files. 
 
3.5.4  Model Performance Evaluation 
The CAMx model configuration was applied to the 2005 and 2006 base cases using the episode-
specific meteorological parameters and emissions.  The CAMx modeling results were compared to 
the measured ozone and ozone precursor concentrations, which resulted in a number of modeling 
iterations involving improvements to the meteorological and emissions modeling and subsequent 
CAMx modeling.  A detailed performance evaluation for each of the 2005 and 2006 base case 
modeling episodes is included in Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment 
Demonstration SIP.  In addition, all performance evaluation products are available on the TCEQ 
FTP site (TCEQ, 2009). 
 
3.5.4.1  Performance Evaluations Overview 
The performance evaluation of the base case modeling demonstrates the adequacy of the model to 
correctly replicate the relationship between levels of ozone and the emissions of NOX and VOC.  
The model’s ability to suitably replicate this relationship is necessary to have confidence in the 
model’s prediction of the response of ozone to various control measures.  As recommended in the 
EPA modeling guidance, the TCEQ conducted two types of performance evaluations, operational 
and diagnostic.  
 
3.5.4.2  Operational Evaluations 
Statistical measures including the Unpaired Peak Accuracy (UPA), the Mean Normalized Bias 
(MNB), and the Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) were calculated by comparing measured 
and bi-linearly interpolated modeled ozone concentrations for all episode days and regulatory 
monitors.  Graphical measures including time series and scatter plots of hourly measured and bi-
linearly interpolated modeled ozone and where applicable, some ozone precursors (e.g., nitric 
oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ETH, and CO) concentrations were developed for each 
regulatory monitor.  In addition, tile plots of modeled daily maximum eight-hour ozone 
concentrations were developed and overlaid with the measured daily maximum eight-hour ozone 
concentrations.  Detailed operational evaluations for each of the 2005 and 2006 base case modeling 
episodes are included in Appendix C: CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.  
 
Statistical Evaluations 
The statistical evaluations presented focus on the comparison of the measured and modeled eight-
hour ozone concentrations.  Figure 3-12.a:  Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration, Measured 
versus Modeled for the 2005 Episode Days and Figure 3-12.b:  Peak Eight-Hour Ozone 
Concentration, Measured versus Modeled for the 2006 Episode Days compare the measured and 
modeled peak eight-hour ozone concentrations for each episode day of the 2005 and 2006 base 
cases, respectively.  Figure 3-13.a:  Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) and Bias (MNB) for 
2005 Episode Days and Figure 3-13.b:  Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) and Bias (MNB) 
for 2006 Episode Days show the MNGE and MNB for monitored eight-hour ozone concentrations 
greater than 40 ppb for each episode day of the 2005 and 2006 base cases, respectively.  Although 
there are no recommended criteria for the eight-hour UPA, MNGE, and MNB, the one-hour levels 
recommended by the EPA (i.e., plus or minus 20 percent, 30 percent, and plus or minus 15 percent, 
respectively) were used for statistical evaluations.

The error bars on the daily peak measured eight-hour ozone concentrations, in Figures 3-12.a: Peak 
Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration, Measured versus Modeled for the 2005 Episode Days and 3-
12.b:  Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration, Measured versus Modeled for the 2006 Episode 
Days represent the plus or minus 20 percent UPA range for comparison with the daily peak 
modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations.  For the 37 episode days in the 2005 base cases, only 
seven days have daily peak modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations greater than 20 percent of the 
daily peak measured eight-hour ozone concentrations.  For the 50 episode days in the 2006 base 
cases only ten days have daily peak modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations outside the plus or 
minus 20 percent UPA range.

Figure 3-12.b:  Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration, Measured versus Modeled for the 
2006 Episode Days 
 
 
Taking into consideration that only 17 days out of the 87 days modeled in the 2005 and 2006 base 
case episodes have daily peak modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations outside the plus or minus 
20 percent UPA range, the model suitably predicts the daily peak eight-hour ozone concentrations.

The area depicted in Figures 3-12.a: Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) and Bias (MNB) for 
2005 Episode Days and 3-12.b: Mean Normalized Gross Error (MNGE) and Bias (MNB) for 2006 
Episode Days with MNGE < 30 percent and MNB < plus or minus 15 percent represents the joint 
condition for which both the MNGE and MNB are within acceptable ranges.  The episode days 
labeled in red indicate those days for which daily peak measured eight-hour ozone concentrations 
were greater than or equal to 80 ppb. 
 
For the 31 days of the 2005 base case episodes with daily peak measured eight-hour ozone 
concentrations greater than or equal to 80 ppb 19 days meet the joint condition of having both the 
MNGE < 30 percent and MNB < plus or minus 15 percent.  The average peak monitored ozone for 
those 31 days was 93.9 ppb, and the corresponding average peak modeled ozone concentration was 
101.1 ppb.  The average mean normalized bias and mean normalized gross error were 11.4 and 
19.0 percent, respectively. 
 
For the 36 days of the 2006 base case episodes with daily peak measured eight-hour ozone 
concentrations greater than or equal to 80 ppb, 24 days meet the joint condition of having both the 
MNGE < 30 percent and MNB < plus or minus 15 percent.  The average peak monitored ozone for 
those 36 days was 96.9 ppb, and the corresponding average peak modeled ozone concentration was 
95.1 ppb.  The average mean normalized bias and normalized gross error were 8.8 and 16.9 percent, 
respectively. 
 
Taking into consideration that 43 days out of the 67 episode days in the 2005 and 2006 base cases 
with daily peak measured eight-hour ozone concentration greater than or equal to 80 ppb meet the 
joint condition of having both the MNGE < 30 percent and MNB < plus or minus 15 percent, the 
model suitably predicts the temporal pattern of daily eight-hour ozone concentrations at the various 
monitors.

Graphical Evaluations 
A detailed graphical evaluation of modeling results is presented in Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling 
for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.  A selection of graphical evaluations, organized by 
episode modeled, is presented in this section.   
 
For each of the 2005 and 2006 base case episodes, time series comparing hourly measured (red 
dots) and modeled (blue line) ozone concentrations are shown for three monitors in the eight-
county HGB area.  The monitors presented vary by episode and were selected on the basis of 
ozone measured.  Included on the time-series graphic is the modeled maximum and minimum 
hourly ozone concentration within the 7 x 7 grid cell array around the monitor (green shading).  
Additionally, time series comparing hourly measured and modeled ozone concentrations are 
shown for two or three rural monitors (GRVL and LACT, and SAGA, which was not in operation 
during bc05ep0 and bc05ep1).  Figure 3-14: TexAQS II Monitoring Sites Outside HGB/BPA is a 
map of rural monitors.

Also included for each of the episodes are logarithmically-scaled scatter plots comparing the 
hourly measured and modeled concentrations of ozone (O3), NOX, ETH, and olefins (OLE).  
Monitor sites included in the graphical representation were the three monitors with the highest 
daily maximum monitored eight-hour ozone concentrations.  If one of the top three sites did not 
also have an auto-GC, the third highest ozone monitoring site was replaced by the auto-GC site 
measuring the highest ozone.  OLE is a CAMx chemical surrogate representing olefinic VOC, 
such as propylene, but excluding ethylene and certain compounds known as internal olefins such 

 
3-39 
                                                
as butenes (internal olefins are represented in CB05 by the surrogate species IOLE).  Both 
ethylene and propylene are HRVOC and their emissions were adjusted in the base case modeling 
by the emissions reconciliation discussed previously in Section 3.4:  Emissions Modeling.  
Included on the scatter plots is the measured versus modeled Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot, which 
first sorts independently both the measured and modeled concentrations, then plots the sorted 
values together.  QQ plot data, shown as red dots, provide a measure of how close the modeled 
and measured distributions of values are to each other.  If the red dots lie close to the diagonal 
one-to-one line, the model generates the correct proportions of small, medium, and large 
concentration values. 
 
Tile plots of the of the daily peak modeled eight-hour ozone concentrations are shown for 
selected episode days on which several monitors measured maximum daily eight-hour ozone 
concentrations greater than 84 ppb.  Included on the tile plots are the monitor locations 
represented by small circles, color coded for the measured ozone concentration.  The same scale 
is used for the measured and modeled maximum daily eight-hour ozone concentrations. 
 
Bc05ep0: May 19 through June 3, 2005 
For the bc05ep0 episode, hourly time series are presented for the Conroe Relocated (CNR2; 
CAMS 78), Northwest Harris County (HNWA; CAMS 26), and Wallisville Road (WALV; 
CAMS 617)1 monitors in Figure 3-15:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode 
bc05ep0 at the CNR2, HNWA, and WALV Monitors.  In general, the modeled ozone 
concentrations, including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, replicate the diurnal pattern of 
the observations.  The lower ozone concentrations measured during the early morning hours, 
especially at the Conroe Relocated monitor, and the very highest ozone concentrations, for 
example, Northwest Harris County, May 27, 2005, were less well replicated.  The unfavorable 
comparison between the measured and modeled hourly ozone concentrations during the early 
morning hours at the Conroe Relocated monitor is likely due to local factors, such as NOX 
emissions and low wind speed meteorological conditions, which reduces the areal representation 
of the monitor to much less than the 4 km grid cell size on which the modeled concentration is 
simulated.  Thus, this disparity is not necessarily an indication of poor model performance since 
local factors may create greater ozone gradients.

Figure 3-16:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc05ep0 at the GRVL and 
LACT Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, except for the latter part of the episode in the rural region represented by the 
LACT monitor, for which the modeled concentrations are relatively constant throughout the day.  
The lower ozone concentrations measured during the early morning hours on some days and not 
replicated by the model are likely due to localized emissions and meteorology limiting the areal 
representation of the monitors as described previously.  Overall, modeled and measured rural 
concentrations compare favorably, and modeled rural concentrations are unlikely to cause any 
substantial predictive bias within the HGB area during this episode.

Scatter plots for the bc05ep0 episode comparing the hourly measured and modeled concentrations 
at the  Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor (non-regulatory monitor) are shown in Figure 3-17:  
Scatter Plots of Hourly Ozone, NOX, ETH, and OLE at the WALV Monitor for the bc05ep0 
Episode.  The model tends to over-predict ozone at the lower measured concentrations (less than 
60 ppb), but compares favorably at the higher ozone concentrations.  Conversely, the model tends 
to under-predict the NOX at the lower measured concentrations, but compares favorably at the 
higher NOX concentrations.  The rank correlation QQ plot for ETH is quite favorable, although 
there is notable scatter in the individual hourly comparisons.  The model tends to under-predict 
the lower and higher OLE concentrations.

Tile plots of daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentrations for May 27, May 31, June 1, and

Concentrations for May 27 and 31 and June 1 through 2, 2005.  The dots represent the monitored 
value, whereas the background color represents the modeled results.  Where a dot’s color matches 
the surrounding color, the model has accurately replicated the measured ozone at that monitor. 
The model replicates the areas of highest eight-hour ozone for the selected days, with the 
exception of May 31, 2005.

episode.

Bc05ep1:  June 17 through 30, 2005 
For the bc05ep1 episode, hourly time series are presented for the Deer Park (DRPK; CAMS 35), 
Houston Croquet (HCQA; CAMS 409) and Manvel Croix Park (MACP; CAMS 84) monitors in 
Figure 3-19:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc05ep1 at the DRPK, 
HCQA, and MACP Monitors.  In general the modeled ozone concentrations, including the 7 x 7 
cell maximum-minimum range, replicate the diurnal pattern of the observations, with the 
exception of the lower ozone concentrations measured during the early morning hours, especially 
at the Manvel Croix Park (CAMS 84) monitor.

Figure 3-20:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc05ep1 at the GRVL and 
LACT Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, with generally favorable comparisons during the daytime.  The model does 
not replicate the lower ozone concentrations measured on some days during the early morning 
hours, likely for reasons previously discussed.  Overall, modeled and measured rural 
concentrations compare favorably, and modeled rural concentrations are unlikely to cause any 
substantial predictive bias within the HGB area during this episode.

Scatter plots for the bc05ep1 episode comparing the hourly measured and modeled concentrations 
at the Deer Park (CAMS 35) monitor are shown in Figure 3-21: Scatter Plots of Hourly Ozone, 
NOX, ETH, and OLE at the DRPK Monitor for the bc05ep1 Episode.  The model tends to over-
predict ozone at the lower measured concentrations, but compares quite favorably at the higher 
ozone concentrations.  The model tends to generally over-predict the NOX, especially at the lower 
measured concentrations.  The QQ plot for ETH is quite favorable, although there is some scatter 
in the individual hourly comparisons.  The model tends to under-predict the lower OLE 
concentrations and while the QQ plot shows a favorable rank correlation, there is notable scatter 
in the individual hourly comparisons.

days quite favorably.

episode.

Bc05ep2:  July 26 through August 8, 2005 
For the bc05ep2 episode, hourly time series are presented for the Houston Bayland Park (BAYP; 
CAMS 53), TCEQ Houston Regional Office (HROC; CAMS 81), and Texas City (TXCT; CAMS 
620) (non-regulatory monitor) monitors in Figure 3-23:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone 
Concentrations for Episode bc05ep2 at the BAYP, HROC, and TXCT Monitors.  Relatively high 
ozone concentrations were measured at these monitors on several days during this episode.  In 
general, the modeled ozone concentrations, including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, 
replicate the diurnal pattern of the observations, with the exception of the lower ozone 
concentrations measured during the early morning hours, especially at the Houston Bayland Park  
(CAMS 53) monitor.

3-49 
Figure 3-24:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc05ep2 at the GRVL, 
LACT, and SAGA Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, with a tendency to over-predict the peak hourly ozone concentrations during 
the daytime.  The over-prediction at these rural monitors appears to follow the same pattern as the 
over-prediction of ozone concentrations in the HGB area, especially during the latter part of the 
episode.

Scatter plots for the bc05ep2 episode comparing the hourly measured and modeled concentrations 
at the TXCT monitor (non-regulatory monitor) are shown in Figure 3-25:  Scatter Plots of Hourly 
Ozone, NOX, ETH, and OLE at the TXCT Monitor for the bc05ep2 Episode.  The model generally 
tends to over-predict ozone, especially at the lower measured concentrations.  Although the QQ 
plot indicates a favorable rank correlation for the NOX, there is notable scatter in the individual 
hourly comparisons.  The QQ plot for ETH indicates an even more favorable rank correlation, 
again with notable scatter in the individual hourly comparisons.  The model tends to under-
predict the lower and higher OLE concentrations, also with considerable scatter in the individual 
hourly comparisons.

and August 6, 2005, are shown in Figure 3-26:  Tile Plot of Daily Maximum Eight-Hour Ozone 
Concentrations for July 28, August 1 through 2, and August 4, 2005.  The model replicates the

Bc06ep0:  May 31 through June 15, 2006 
For the bc06ep0 episode, hourly time series are presented for the TCEQ Houston Regional Office 
(HROC; CAMS 81), Shell Westhollow (SHWH, CAMS 410), and Wallisville (WALV; CAMS 
617) (non-regulatory monitor) monitors in Figure 3-27:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone 
Concentrations for Episode bc06ep0 at the HROC, SHWH, and WALV Monitors.  Relatively high 
ozone concentrations were measured at these monitors on several days during this episode.  In 
general, the modeled ozone concentrations, including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, 
replicate the diurnal pattern of the observations, with the exception of the lower ozone 
concentrations measured during the early morning hours, especially at the Shell Westhollow 
(CAMS 410) monitor.

Figure 3-28:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06ep0 at the GRVL, 
LACT, and SAGA Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, with generally favorable comparisons during the daytime.  The model does 
not replicate the lower ozone concentrations measured on some days during the early morning 
hours.  Overall, modeled and measured rural concentrations compare favorably, and modeled 
rural concentrations are unlikely to cause any substantial predictive bias within the HGB area 
during this episode.

at the Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor (non-regulatory monitor) are shown in Figure 3-29:  
Scatter Plots of Hourly Ozone, NOX, ETH, and OLE at the WALV Monitor for the bc06ep0 
Episode.  The model tends to over-predict ozone at the lower measured concentrations, but 
compares more favorably at the higher concentrations.  Conversely, the model tends to under-
predict NOX at the lower measured concentrations, and slightly over-predict at the higher NOX 
concentrations.  The QQ plot for ETH indicates a somewhat favorable rank correlation, although 
the model generally tends to under-predict the ETH concentrations.  The model also tends to 
under-predict the OLE concentrations.

Bc06aqs1:  August 13 through September 15, 2006 
For the bc06aqs1 episode, hourly time series are presented for the Houston Bayland Park (BAYP;

in Figure 3-31:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06aqs1 at the BAYP, 
DRPK, and HSMA Monitors.  Relatively high ozone concentrations were measured at these 
monitors on several days during this episode.  In general, the modeled ozone concentrations, 
including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, replicate the diurnal pattern of the 
observations, with the exception of the very highest measured hourly ozone concentrations.

Figure 3-32:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06aqs1 at the GRVL, 
LACT, and SAGA Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations, with generally favorable comparisons during the daytime, with the exception 
of the region represented by the GRVL monitor on August 31 and September 1, 2006, when the 
higher measured ozone concentrations are notably under-predicted.  In addition, the model tends 
to over-predict the ozone concentrations during the first segment of this episode, August 15 
through 22, 2006, in the regions represented by LACT and SAGA monitors.  Again, the model 
does not replicate the lower ozone concentrations measured on some days during the early 
morning hours.  Overall, modeled and measured rural concentrations compare favorably enough 
that the modeled rural concentrations are unlikely to cause any substantial predictive bias within 
the HGB area during this episode.

QQ plot for ETH indicates a somewhat favorable rank correlation, although the model tends to 
under-predict the higher ETH concentrations.  The model tends to under-predict the lower range 
of OLE concentrations and also under-predicts the very highest.

Bc06aqs2:  September 16 through October 11, 2006 
For the bc06aqs2 episode, hourly time series are presented for the Conroe Relocated (CNR2; 
CAMS 78), Galveston (GALV; CAMS 34), and Deer Park (DRPK; CAMS 35) monitors in 
Figure 3-35:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06aqs2 at the CNR2, 
DRPK, and GALV Monitors.  Relatively high ozone concentrations were measured at these 
monitors on several days during this episode.  In general, the modeled ozone concentrations, 
including the 7 x 7 cell maximum-minimum range, replicate the diurnal pattern of the 
observations, with the exception of the lower ozone concentrations measured during the early 
morning hours, especially at the Conroe Relocated (CAMS 78) monitor.

Figure 3-36:  Time Series of Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Episode bc06aqs2 at the GRVL, 
LACT, and SAGA Rural Monitors provides a comparison of measured and modeled hourly ozone 
concentrations at rural monitors.  Modeled concentrations generally replicate the diurnal pattern 
of the observations.  However, the model performance in the rural areas represented by these 
monitors varies for the different segments of the episode.  For example, during the first segment, 
the model notably under-predicts the peak daytime ozone concentrations at all three monitors but 
compares more favorably with the peak daytime ozone concentrations measured during the 
middle portion of the third segment.  Again, the model does not replicate the lower ozone 
concentrations measured on some days during the early morning hours.  Overall, modeled and 
measured rural concentrations compare favorably enough that the modeled rural concentrations 
are unlikely to cause any substantial predictive bias within the HGB area during this episode.

concentrations at the Deer Park (CAMS 35) monitor are shown in Figure 3-37:  Scatter Plots of 
Hourly Ozone, NOX, ETH, and OLE at the DRPK Monitor for the bc06aqs2 Episode.  As shown, 
there is a favorable comparison for the mid-range and higher ozone concentrations, with a slight 
tendency for the model to over-predict the measured concentrations.  Although the QQ plot for 
NOX indicates a favorable rank correlation, the model tends to generally over-predict the NOX 
concentrations.  The QQ plot for ETH also indicates a favorable rank correlation, although the 
model tends to over-predict the lower concentrations and under-predict the higher ETH 
concentrations.  The model tends to under-predict the lower range of OLE concentrations with 
considerable scatter in the higher concentrations.

Evaluations Based on TexAQS II Data 
Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP includes extensive 
comparisons of model predictions with observations collected by the many platforms employed 
during TexAQS II.  This section provides general descriptions of the major sampling platforms 
employed and presents highlights of some of the conclusions reached based on these comparisons. 
In graphics comparing TexAQS II observations with modeled output, observational data are 

 
3-64 
typically labeled as mixing ratios, which report moles of the pollutant per mole of ambient air.  In 
practical terms, the term mixing ratio is synonymous with concentration. 
 
Rural Monitoring Network 
The TexAQS II study included a number of additional monitoring sites, which began collecting 
data in the summer of 2005 and continued until late October, 2006.  During the TexAQS II 
intensive period, August 1 through October 15, 2006, a total of nine additional ozone monitors 
had been deployed in rural areas.  Two of these additional monitors were the CLVL monitor near 
the Texas Oklahoma border, which also collected NOX and total reactive nitrogen (NOY) during 
this period, and the SAGA monitor, which collected NOX in addition to ozone.  The SAGA 
monitor, discussed in the previous section, was one of those deployed for TexAQS II.  A full 
discussion of model performance at these and other rural monitors is provided in Appendix C:  
CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.   
 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP3-3D Orion 
The NOAA WP-3D (P3) flew missions in the area between August 31 and October 13, 2006, and 
sampled many species not routinely monitored, including formaldehyde, NOY, nitric acid, and a 
suite of reactive hydrocarbons.  Figure 3-39:  Comparison of Modeled and P3 Observed Ozone 
(O3), August 31, 2006, 14:16 to 15:33 CST, illustrates the flight of August 31, 2006, as the 
aircraft first arrived from Florida.  The top two panels compare observed and modeled ozone 
concentrations (referred to on the plots as mixing ratio) along the flight track, while the bottom 
two compare the observed and modeled concentrations as a time series and a scatter plot 
superimposed with a QQ plot.  The results are consistent with Figure 3-34:  Tile Plot of Daily 
Maximum Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations for August 17 and 31, and September 1 and 7, 2006, 
which showed that the model correctly placed the highest ozone concentrations geographically, 
but did not replicate the magnitude of the highest observations at the surface.  The P3 flight 
shows that at the elevation of the aircraft, around 500 meters above ground level (AGL), the 
model also replicated the position of the highest ozone concentrations, but, as above, the model 
did not replicate the high concentrations seen in western Harris County.

Figure 3-39:  Comparison of Modeled and P3 Observed Ozone (O3), August 31, 2006, 14:16 
to 15:33 CST 
 
 
The model’s under-prediction of the highest observed ozone concentrations was common 
throughout most of the flights.  A detailed discussion of model comparisons with P3 data can be 
found in Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.  Some of the 
conclusions reached are that the model usually replicated the winds observed by the P3 well and 
even in cases where it showed a directional bias, usually placed the highest ozone concentrations 
in about the right location.  The model reproduced the observed NOX concentrations well, but 
over-predicted CO.  Most hydrocarbon species were under-predicted by the model, even after the 
HRVOC reconciliation, as was formaldehyde on most occasions.  Isoprene concentrations were 
generally modeled well, but some high modeled isoprene concentrations did not match the 
observations.  
 
NOAA Twin Otter Tunable Optical Profiler for Aerosol and oZone (TOPAZ) 
A second NOAA aircraft, a Twin Otter, carried a downward-looking lidar tuned to ozone and 
aerosol loading called TOPAZ.  Data from this instrument were valuable because they allowed 
modeled ozone to be compared with measurements vertically through up to 3,000 meters AGL.  
The instrument was flown on 13 missions between August 15 and September 13, 2006.  The top 
two panels of Figure 3-40:  TOPAZ-Observed and Modeled Ozone Concentrations on August 31, 
2006 compare observed and measured ozone concentrations between 255 and 377 meters AGL, 
which is the fifth vertical modeling layer.  The lower plots are ozone curtains, showing ozone 
concentrations from the surface up to the aircraft elevation along the entire flight path and show 
that at around 15:00 the under-prediction carried upwards to over 1,500 meters.  The TOPAZ 
concentrations near the surface are highly variable and may include contamination from surface 
features and thus, may not accurately reflect ozone concentrations within the first 200 meters.   
 

 
3-66 
 
Figure 3-40:  TOPAZ-Observed and Modeled Ozone Concentrations on August 31, 2006 
 
 
Like the P3, the TOPAZ also showed that the model usually placed the highest ozone 
concentrations in the correct location, but generally under-predicted the observed peak 
concentrations.  A comparison between the TOPAZ measurements of ozone concentration with 
those made by the P3 (the two flew together on only two days), showed relatively good 
agreement.  The TOPAZ measured ozone concentrations above the mixed layer on most days that 
were notably higher than the model predicted. 
 
The Research Vessel (RV) Ronald H. Brown 
The NOAA RV Ron Brown arrived in the HGB area on August 15, 2006, and collected data until 
its departure on September 13.  The ship carried a wide array of sampling platforms onboard and 
provided extensive data collected in the Gulf of Mexico, Galveston Bay, and in the Houston Ship 
Channel.  Figure 3-41:  Comparison of Ozone Concentrations Observed by the RV Ron Brown 
with Modeled Concentrations, August 31, 2006, 08:00 to 16:30, compares observed and modeled 
ozone for the period from 8:00 to 16:30 on August 31.  The ship sailed from Barbour’s Cut into 
the Gulf of Mexico, and then along the coast to near Freeport.  This figure shows that the model 
predicted the observed concentrations of ozone very well from Barbour’s Cut to Galveston and 
then showed a brief period of over-prediction as the observed concentrations dipped between 
11:00 and 12:00.  The decrease in measured ozone concentrations coincided with a period of very 
high NOX concentrations observed in the channel between Galveston Island and Bolivar 
Peninsula.  The observed NOX was probably emitted by local ship traffic and likely reduced the 
ozone concentrations through titration.  As the ship sailed into the Gulf of Mexico, it measured 
unusually high ozone concentrations moving onshore, which the model under-predicted.  This 
under-prediction may be the result of long-range transport or of model boundary conditions that 
are too low on this day.  As an alternative, the under-prediction may have resulted from air 
advected out into the Gulf of Mexico the previous day from the Houston or Beaumont areas.  

 
3-67 
More often, the ship encountered low ozone concentrations in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly 
under southerly wind conditions, which the model often over-predicted. 
 
 
Figure 3-41:  Comparison of Ozone Concentrations Observed by the RV Ron Brown with 
Modeled Concentrations, August 31, 2006, 08:00 to 16:30 
 
 
Ozone Sondes 
A number of ozone sondes, lightweight and compact balloon-borne instruments, were launched 
from the University of Houston (UH) campus southeast of downtown Houston and also from the 
deck of the RV Ron Brown in 2006.  Ozone monitors attached to these balloons provide an 
opportunity to evaluate the model’s vertical ozone distribution.  Figure 3-42:  Comparison of 
Modeled and Observed Vertical Ozone Profiles from Two Sonde Launches at UH Campus and 
One Sonde Launch from the RV Ron Brown in the Gulf of Mexico, August 31, 2006, shows three 
vertical ozone profiles measured by sondes launched from the UH campus on August 31, 2006, 
compared with modeled concentrations on that day.  The left-hand panel shows that for the 
morning (6:00 a.m.) launch from the UH campus, ozone concentrations fluctuated with altitude 
within the first 1,500 meters.  This effect may not represent actual variability in concentrations, 
however, since the measurements made by the sondes launched from UH were susceptible to 
interference by sulfur dioxide (SO2); each molecule of SO2 encountered by the instrument 
effectively cancels out one molecule of ozone.  Because there are numerous SO2 sources 
relatively close to the UH campus, it is very likely that the balloon may have encountered one of 
these plumes during ascent. 
 
Aside from the fluctuations, the model replicated ozone concentrations reasonably well up to 
around 1,200 meters.  The model under-predicted ozone concentrations up to about 5,000 meters, 
but predicted concentrations fairly well above that altitude.  At 12:29 p.m. (center panel), the 
model slightly over-predicted ozone concentrations near the surface, but observed ozone 
concentrations increased dramatically within the first 100 meters or so to 30 ppb greater than 

 
3-68 
modeled concentrations.  Unlike the notches seen in the morning launch, this effect is most likely 
caused by ozone scavenging by nearby NOX sources, probably vehicular traffic.  More 
significantly, after the first few meters, the model continued to under-predict observed ozone 
concentrations up to 4,000 meters. 
 
The right-hand panel of Figure 3-42:  Comparison of Modeled and Observed Vertical Ozone 
Profiles from Two Sonde Launches at UH Campus and one Sonde Launch from the RV Ron 
Brown in the Gulf of Mexico, August 31, 2006 shows ozone concentrations observed and modeled 
for a sonde launch from the deck of the RV Ron Brown, coincident with the 12:29 p.m. launch 
from the UH.  In this case, the model initially over-predicted ozone concentrations near the 
surface by 15 ppb, but within the first 100 meters or so the sonde recorded a drop in ozone 
concentrations, followed by a rapid rise.  This feature is probably due to the balloon encountering 
sulfate emissions from a ship plume, possibly from a passing ship or from the Ron Brown.  The 
modeled and observed profiles crossed at about 1,200 meters, and then the observations exceeded 
the model by 10 to 20 ppb up to 4,000 meters.  Farther above, the observations oscillated around 
the modeled values.

Moody Tower 
The Moody Tower site is located atop a dormitory on the UH campus southeast of downtown 
Houston.  The site is useful because it is located 60 meters AGL (in model layer 2), hence is 
insulated from some of the more localized emission sources.  Much of the Moody Tower data has 
been incorporated into the standard model performance evaluation processing performed at the 

 
3-69 
TCEQ for surface sites, with special provisions to use modeled concentrations from layer 2 
instead of layer 1.  Within this framework, the Moody Tower data offers measurements of some 
atmospheric constituents explicitly tracked in the CB05 mechanism, including nitric acid, nitrous 
acid, and formaldehyde.  In addition, researchers at this site collected a wealth of information on 
radicals associated with photochemical ozone production.  These data are used in conjunction 
with CAMx Chemical Process Analysis in Section 5.1:  QUANTITATIVE CORROBORATIVE 
ANALYSIS of this document. 
 
Other TexAQS II Data 
During TexAQS II, formaldehyde data were collected at two sites, Lynchburg Ferry and Houston 
Regional Monitor-3.  These data have been incorporated into the TCEQ model performance 
evaluation database and are being used in routine comparisons between modeled and observed 
concentrations. 
 
Some additional TexAQS II data have not yet been used for model performance evaluation 
because they were not yet available in a usable form, but may be useful in the future.  These data 
sources include the Houston Triangle project, the Baylor Aztec flights, the Solar Occultation Flux 
(SOF) measurements, “smart” balloon data, Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy 
(DOAS) observations, and satellite observations. 
 
3.5.4.3  Diagnostic Evaluations 
Since future design values are based solely on the model’s relative response and not on the 
magnitude of its future case ozone predictions, evaluating the model’s response to emission 
changes becomes at least as important as evaluation of its ability to reproduce historically 
observed events.  The EPA modeling guidance recommends several possible means of assessing 
model response to emission changes.  However, most of these methods are either indirect 
(probing tools, alternative base cases, most observation-based models) or are difficult to employ 
in practice (retrospective analyses).  In this section the TCEQ employs three tests to evaluate the 
model’s response to emission changes.  The first of these is a sensitivity analysis designed to test 
the model’s response to a hypothetical inventory change, specifically, an increase in emissions 
from flares.  The second test is a retrospective analysis that uses an existing 2000 baseline 
inventory to test the model’s ability to predict ozone design values in a previous year.  The third, 
a weekday-weekend analysis, is based on observational modeling designed to assess an area’s 
VOC- or NOX-sensitivity.  
 
Flare Sensitivity Modeling 
The TCEQ has been evaluating flares as a potential source of underreported VOC emissions since 
TexAQS 2000.  Flare monitoring requirements in the HRVOC rules in 30 TAC Chapter 115, 
Subchapter H, Division 1, were adopted in 2002 and designed to provide more accurate 
information on HRVOC and total flow rate to the flares.  More recently, the TCEQ has been 
evaluating potential issues with the destruction efficiencies used to calculate emissions from 
flares.  Due to the open combustion nature of flares, direct measurement of flare emissions or 
verification of flare destruction efficiencies is problematic.  Remote sensing technologies such as 
differential absorption lidar (DIAL) can be used to estimate flare emissions and destruction 
efficiency.  Recent work with DIAL during TexAQS II indicated destruction efficiencies on an 
actual industrial flare were less than assumed for reporting purposes.  However, the use of such 
remote sensing technology is expensive and currently limited to research activities such as 
TexAQS II.  Therefore, companies must still use an assumed destruction efficiency to calculate 
VOC emissions from flares.  Most companies assume a flare destruction efficiency of 98 to 99 
percent, meaning the VOC emission rate is only one or two percent of the VOC mass rate sent to 
the flare.  These assumptions are based on a small number of controlled studies conducted in the 
early 1980s and may not represent flare operations in real-world conditions.  Furthermore, the 
chemistry that occurs within the flare flame is not well-understood in the majority of situations.  
Products of incomplete combustion may be formed and emitted from flares in addition to 

 
3-70 
uncombusted VOC from the material sent to the flares.  Some researchers have speculated that 
flares could emit formaldehyde in sufficient quantities to significantly enhance photochemical 
reactivity in the flare plumes (Castineira and Edgar, 2006; Robinson et al., 2008).  
 
To study the sensitivity of the model to potential unaccounted-for flare emissions, a model run 
was conducted in which flare emissions were increased ten-fold (10X).  This is equivalent to 
reducing assumed flare destruction efficiency from 99 percent to 90 percent.  At the same time, 
the potential source contribution function (PSCF)-based HRVOC reconciliation was removed.  
The net effect on emissions was to replace the 23.1 tpd of ground-level HRVOC emissions with 
321.6 tpd of elevated flare VOC, of which 87.9 tpd is HRVOC. 
 
Figure 3-43:  Comparison of P3 Measurements with Base Case and Enhanced Flare Emissions; 
observed ethylene, formaldehyde, and ozone  compared to modeled concentrations using the base 
case inventory, and (right) the base case inventory with 10X flare VOC emissions, minus the 
HRVOC reconciliation compares (A) modeled ETH, (B) formaldehyde (FORM), and (C) Ozone 
concentrations with observations made on the NOAA WP-3D Orion aircraft during TexAQS II, 
inside the 2 km HGB modeling grid.  In each row, the left-hand panel shows the comparison 
using the 2005-2006 base case modeling inventory, while the right-hand panel shows a similar 
comparison using the inventory with the ten-fold increase in flare VOC emissions (and 
concurrent removal of the HRVOC reconciliation discussed earlier in Section 3.4.2.1:  Point 
Sources).  The green dots represent actual data pairs.  The red dots are plotted by matching the 
smallest observed value with the smallest modeled value, then the next smallest of each, and so 
on.  The resulting QQ plot provides a means to compare the two distributions; if it lies close to 
the diagonal line, then the model is simulating the correct proportions of small, medium, and 
large concentrations of the pollutant.

The flare sensitivity markedly improves the distribution of modeled ethylene concentrations 
compared with observations and also improves modeled formaldehyde and ozone concentrations, 

 
3-72 
although the highest modeled ozone concentration remains at about 105 ppb compared with 
observations ranging to near 145 ppb.  This discrepancy is at least partly due to the 
incommensurability of the measurements:  modeled values represent averages over one hour over 
a 2 km x 2 km region (also across a vertical depth depending on model layer), while the aircraft 
measurements are essentially single points in space and time.  However, the 10X flare sensitivity 
modeling degrades performance for some pollutants at the surface, as illustrated in Figure 3-44:  
Log-Log Plots of Observed vs. Modeled Ethylene at Deer Park September 19 through October 11, 
2006; with base case inventory, and base case inventory with 10X flare emissions minus the 
HRVOC reconciliation, which compares modeled and observed ozone concentrations at Deer 
Park to base case and 10X flare emissions (note that these plots use a log-log scale; blue dots 
represent observed-modeled pairs, and red dots indicate the QQ plot).

Figure 3-45:  Daily Peak Modeled Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations with Base Case Inventory  
and 10X Flare Inventory; the difference between the two plots (Flare 10X – Reg 10) is shown at 
right shows the effect of the 10X flare VOC increase on eight-hour peak ozone concentrations on 
October 6, 2006.  The ozone plume, while still under-estimated, clearly matches the observed 
surface concentrations better with the 10X flare inventory (center) than the base case inventory 
(left).  Observed eight-hour peak ozone concentrations are shown as small circles at the monitor 
locations.

In addition to the 10X VOC sensitivity, the TCEQ ran a sensitivity in which only HRVOC 
emissions from flares were increased (also 10X).  A third sensitivity further modified the 10X 
HRVOC sensitivity to add a formaldehyde boost equal to 10 percent of the added HRVOC 
emissions.  Results of these sensitivities can be found in Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the 
HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP. 
 
More work is needed to determine whether a flare adjustment is superior to the surface-level 
reconciliation currently in use.  The TCEQ plans to investigate using a PSCF-based technique 
applied to flare emissions in the near future. 
 
Retrospective Modeling – 2000 Backcast 
The purpose of this test is to test the model in a forecast (in this case, backcast) mode, where the 
answer is known in advance.  Retrospective modeling is usually difficult to implement in practice 
because of the need to create an inventory, but a 2000 inventory was already available.  In this 
test, most of the 2006 baseline inventory was replaced with a baseline inventory previously 
developed for the 2000 ozone episode used in prior SIP revisions.  However, the episode day-
specific biogenic emissions for the 2005 and 2006 episodes were not replaced, as is also the 
practice when modeling a future base emissions inventory.  Similarly, the 2005 and 2006 
meteorology was used with the 2000 baseline emissions as is the procedure when modeling with 
the future emissions. 
 
Since the model predictions of the typical future design values are based on a DVB, which is the 
average of three regulatory design values (EPA, 2007), the quantity forecast in this test is not a 
specific future year’s design value but rather the average of three years.  Thus, the regulatory 
design values for 2000, 2001, and 2002 were averaged in the same manner as the 2006 DVB was 
calculated as the average of the 2006, 2007, and 2008 regulatory design values.  Table 3-16:  
2000 Baseline Design Value Calculation for Retrospective Analysis shows the calculation.  Only 
monitors that had at least one regulatory design value in the 2000-2002 window and also in the 
2006-2008 window were used.

Once the model was run with the 2000 baseline emissions, RRFs were calculated.  In a 
retrospective analysis, most of the RRFs are expected to be greater than 1 because ozone has 
decreased since the retrospective year.  Table 3-17:  2000 Projected DVs Compared with 
Calculated DVs shows the calculated RRFs and the respective projected 2000 design values, 
compared with those listed in Table 3-16:  2000 Baseline Design Value Calculation for 
Retrospective Analysis.

For two sites, Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 35), the projections 
were identical, or nearly identical, to the calculated baseline values.  For all other sites but one, 
the model-projected 2000 DVs were lower than the calculated values, indicating that the model 

 
3-75 
did not respond as well to emission changes as the actual airshed for these sites.  In only one case 
did the model respond notably more strongly than the airshed, Houston Monroe (CAMS 406).   
 
In conclusion, the modeled response generally was lower than the actual airshed’s response to 
2000-2006 emission changes.  This conclusion gives confidence going forward that the model’s 
predictions are conservative, and that future ozone concentrations may be even lower than 
predicted by the model. 
 
Observational Modeling – Weekday/Weekend 
Weekend emissions of NOX in urban areas tend to be lower than weekday emissions because of 
fewer miles driven.  The effect is most pronounced on weekend mornings, especially Sundays, 
since commuting is much lower than weekdays.  In a detailed analysis presented in Appendix C:  
CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP an analysis using modeled 
Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays is described, but the results were rather inconclusive 
because of small sample sizes (15 Wednesdays and 11 each Saturdays and Sundays).  A more 
comprehensive analysis was undertaken to simulate more of each day type; in three separate runs 
each day’s modeled emissions were substituted with, Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday 
emissions.  These runs provided a total of 88 each Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.   
 
For comparison, 6:00 a.m. NOX concentrations were averaged for every Wednesday, Saturday, 
and Sunday between May 15 and October 15 in the years 2005 through 2008, which gives over 
100 of each day (less for some monitors because of missing data).  Figure 3-46:  Mean Observed 
NOX Concentrations at HGB Monitors as a Percentage of Wednesday Mean Values, May 15 
through October 15, 2005 through 2008 shows observed and modeled 6:00 a.m. NOX 
concentrations at 15 sites in the HGB area.  Except for anomalous behavior at Galveston Airport 
(CAMS 34), all monitors show observed and modeled NOX concentrations that decline 
monotonically from Wednesday through Saturday to Sunday.  The observed concentrations 
(excluding Galveston Airport (CAMS 34)) show similar percentage declines, but the modeled 
values have much greater variability, with sites in eastern Harris County (near the Ship Channel) 
showing the slowest declines.  This effect could be due to the model mixing down industrial NOX 
emissions too rapidly.

filtered to remove values less than 40 ppb.  The left-hand panel of the figure shows observed 

 
3-76 
concentrations trending downward for nearly all sites, but some seem to rebound on Sunday and 
exceed the respective Saturday concentrations.  This effect is probably due to filtering 
concentrations below 40 ppb, which removes very low concentrations from the average.

Percentage of Wednesdays 
 
 
While the modeled concentrations are very tightly clustered in the figure, they universally decline 
from Wednesday through Saturday to Sunday, similar to the pattern shown by the observations 
(ignoring the anomalous rebound effect).  The airshed and model both show sensitivity to NOX 
reductions, at least for days with some ozone-forming potential.  In fact, the airshed seems to 
show greater sensitivity to NOX than the model, which suggests that anticipated reductions to 
motor vehicle emissions over the next several years may be more effective than suggested by the 
model. 
 
3.6  BASELINE (2006) AND FUTURE CASE (2018) MODELING  
3.6.1  2006 Baseline Modeling 
The TCEQ selected 2006 as the baseline year for conducting the attainment modeling.  Two 
features of the 2006 baseline year are used in the attainment modeling.  First, the 2006 baseline 
year identifies the three consecutive years (2006, 2007, and 2008) with design values (DVs) that 
include the fourth high of the 2006 baseline year.  These three DVs are averaged to calculate the 
baseline design value (DVB), as previously illustrated in Figure 3-1:  Baseline Design Value 
Calculation Illustration.  Second, typical 2006 ozone season day (OSD) emissions were 
developed, as previously summarized in Table 3-13:  Summary of 2006 Baseline and 2018 Future 
Base, and 2018 Control Strategy Anthropogenic Modeling Emissions for HGB.   
 
The typical 2006 OSD emissions were modeled for all episode days to calculate the denominator 
of the RRF for each of the regulatory monitors.  The denominator of the RRF is the average of the 
modeled maximum daily eight-hour ozone concentrations for those days with modeled 
concentrations greater than or equal to 85 ppb, within a grid cell array about each monitor.   
 
Figure 3-48:  Near Monitoring Site Grid Cell Array Size shows a map of the 2 km subdomain 
nested in a portion of the 4 km x 4 km fine grid domain depicting the monitors, and the extent of 
7 x 7, 5 x 5, and 3 x 3 grid cell arrays based on the 2 km grid.  The TCEQ has calculated RRF 
values for each of these array sizes, but used a 7 x 7 grid array about each monitor.  
 

 
3-77 
 
Figure 3-48:  Near Monitoring Site Grid Cell Array Size 
 
The monitor-specific denominator of the RRF is calculated as the average of the modeled daily 
maximum eight-hour ozone concentrations above 84 ppb at that monitor.  Per the EPA’s 
modeling guidance, if there are fewer than 10 days with 2006 baseline modeled concentrations 
greater than 84 ppb, then days with modeled concentrations less than or equal to 84 ppb can be 
used so the average is based on at least 10 days.  Table 3-18:  2006 DVB, RRF Denominator 
(RRFD), and Number of 2006 Baseline Modeled Days Averaged summarizes the DVB and the 
denominator of the RRF for the HGB regulatory monitors.  There is also one non-regulatory 
monitor, Wallisville Road (CAMS 617), which has a DVB greater than or equal to 85 ppb.  
Including non-regulatory monitors that have a DVB and a RRF denominator greater than or equal 
to 85 ppb mitigates the need to conduct an unmonitored area analysis for the area represented by 
the monitor, as required by the EPA’s modeling guidance.

3.6.2  Future Baseline Modeling 
Similar to the 2006 baseline modeling, the 2018 modeling was conducted for each of the episode 
days using the projected 2018 ozone season day emissions, as previously summarized in Table 3-
13:  Summary of 2006 Baseline and 2018 Future Base, and 2018 Control Strategy Anthropogenic 
Modeling Emissions for HGB.  Using the same days as used in the 2006 baseline modeling to 
calculate the RRFD, an RRF numerator (RRFN) was calculated as the average of the of the 2018 
modeled maximum daily eight-hour ozone concentrations within the 7 x 7 grid cell array about 
each monitor.  The RRF at each monitor was calculated as the quotient of the RRFN and RRFD, 
and the 2018 future design value (DVF) at each monitor was estimated as per EPA’s modeling 
guidance, by the multiplying the 2006 DVB by the RRF.  Table 3-19:  Summary of 2006 Baseline 
Modeling, RRF, and Future Design Values summarizes the 2006 DVB, RRF and 2018 DVF at 
each of the regulatory monitors as well as the Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor (non-
regulatory monitor).

The 2018 baseline attainment modeling projects two regulatory monitors (Houston Bayland Park 
(CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 35)) and one non-regulatory monitor (Wallisville Road 
(CAMS 617)) to have DVFs greater than 84 ppb. 
 
3.6.2.1  Matrix Modeling 
A series of modeling sensitivities using across-the-board percentage reductions to the 2018 
baseline modeling emissions from sources in the eight-county HGB area was conducted.  The 
results of the modeling were used to estimate the amount of NOX and/or VOC emissions 
reduction needed to reduce the DVFs for each of the three monitors to 85 ppb.  Figure 3-49:  DVF 
versus NOX and/or VOC Emissions Reduction Response Curves for the BAYP, DRPK, and WALV 
Monitors graphically shows the response of the DVFs for the Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53), 
Deer Park (CAMS 35), and WALV (non-regulatory monitor) monitors to reductions in emissions 
of NOX and/or VOC from sources in the eight-county HGB area.

3.6.2.2  Modeling Sensitivities:  Emissions Reductions within 100 and 200 km of HGB 
Since the EPA allows NOX and VOC reduction credit for reasonable further progress within 200 
km and 100 km of a nonattainment area, respectively, emissions reduction modeling sensitivities 
were conducted for selected point sources of NOX and area sources of VOC in the 200 km 
adjacent to the eight-county HGB area.  Figure 3-50:  Map of Counties within 100 km (Red) and 
200 km (Orange) of the Eight-County HGB Area displays a map of the counties within 100 km 
and 200 km of the HGB area.

emissions inventory.  However, the sensitivity of the HGB 2018 future design values to 
reductions of NOX and VOC emissions from these outer regions is still representative for the final 
version of the 2018 modeling. 
 
For the counties within 200 km of the eight-county HGB area, point source NOX emission 
reductions (i.e., 25 and 50 percent) were made to selected Texas non-ARD sources including 
compressor engines, boilers, and process heaters.  Compressor engines account for approximately 
47 tpd of the estimated 124 tpd of NOX emissions from the selected sources in the 2018 baseline 
modeling emissions.  In addition, in a separate modeling run, a 50 percent NOX emissions 
reduction was made to 
s
County HGB Area).  Compressor engines in the eastern segment account for approximately 11 
tpd of the estimated 64 tpd of NOX emissions from the selected sources in the 2018 baseline 
modeling emissions.   
 
Table 3-21:  200 km NOX Reduction Modeling Sensitivity summarizes the sensitivity of the 
projected DVFs for the Deer Park (CAMS 35), Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53), and 
Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) (non-regulatory) monitors to NOX emissions reduction from the

3.6.2.3  Ozone Source Apportionment Tool and Anthropogenic Precursor Culpability Analysis 
The TCEQ applied the OSAT and APCA CAMx tools to the 2018 baseline modeling.  For both 
types of analyses, emission source groups, for example, on-road mobile, non- and off-road mobile, 
and biogenics, and source regions, HGB and non-HGB, are defined.  OSAT keeps track of the 
origin of the NOX and VOC precursors creating the ozone, and ozone can then be apportioned to 
pecific sources groups and regions.  APCA is similar to OSAT, but it recognizes that certain 
f every episode for 
e Houston Bayland Park (BAYP; CAMS 53), Deer Park (DRPK; CAMS 35) and Wallisville 
isodes for these three monitors are included in 
Appendix C:  CAMx Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP.   
 
Table 3-23:  OSAT/APCA Source Groups and Regions Defined lists all of the source groups and 
regions tracked in the OSAT and APCA analyses. 
s
sources groups, such as biogenics, are not controllable.  Where OSAT would apportion ozone 
production to biogenic emissions, APCA reallocates that ozone production to the controllable or 
anthropogenic emissions that combined with the biogenic emissions to create ozone. 
 
Results are plotted as layered area plots for every rolling eight-hour average o

Road (WALV; CAMS 617) (non-regulatory) monitors.  Results of one episode of the six modeled 
are presented here as an example.  Plots for all ep

Figures 3-51:  OSAT and APCA Results for BAYP, 3-52:  OSAT and APCA Results for DRPK, 
and 3-53:  OSAT and APCA Results for WALV show the results of these analyses for Houston 
Bayland Park (CAMS 53), Deer Park (CAMS 35), and Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) (non-
regulatory monitor), respectively.  The layer corresponding to the initial model conditions 
disappears after the first few days of the episode are modeled, as expected.  Layers corresponding 
to boundary conditions give an indication of wind direction on individual episode days and 
concentrations of ozone attributable to that boundary.   
 
Layers that correspond to HGB emission sources indicate HGB contribution to the total modeled 
ozone concentration.  The other layers, Biogenics, Other, Initial and Boundary Conditions, and 
Non-HGB Elevated Points, indicate non-HGB contributions to ozone concentration.  Differences 
between the depth of the biogenic layers between the OSAT and APCA plots indicate how ozone 
of biogenic origin is reallocated to anthropogenic sources in APCA. 
 
Lower-level local emission sources, including non-road mobile, area, on-road mobile, and low-
level points, make a greater contribution to ozone at Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) than Deer 
Park (CAMS 35), although Ship Channel sources make a noticeable contribution at Houston 
Bayland Park (CAMS 53).  Conversely, local elevated sources, including HGB elevated points, 
ships, HECT, and MECT, make a greater contribution at Deer Park (CAMS 35) than Houston 
Bayland Park (CAMS 53).  Wallisville ozone origins are more like Deer Park (CAMS 35) than 
Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53).

3.6.3  Future Case Modeling with Controls 
Proposed controls include lowering the total point source HRVOC emissions allocated by the 
HECT rule in Harris County and voluntary emission reductions of NOX and VOC from on- and 
non-road mobile sources within the eight-county HGB area. 
 
3.6.3.1  25 Percent HECT Cap Reduction 
The modeling sensitivity for the HECT rule revision reduced current total allocated point source 
HRVOC emissions by 25 percent, 2.69 tpd.  Table 3-24:  HECT Modeling Sensitivity Results 
shows the DVFs at the Deer Park (CAMS 35), Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53), and Wallisville 
Road (CAMS 617) (non-regulatory) monitors for the baseline as well as those resulting from a 25 
percent reduction in the HRVOC from HECT applicable sources in Harris County.

3.6.3.2  VMEP Reductions  
Up to 3 percent of the estimated emissions needed for attainment (i.e., 75.2 tpd NOX at Deer Park 
(CAMS 35) as shown in Table 3-20:  VOC, NOX and VOC+NOX Emissions Reductions Needed to 
Model Attainment) can be obtained from voluntary control measures.  The Houston-Galveston 
Area Council (H-GAC; http://www.h-gac.com/taq/) has estimated that approximately 2.25 tpd of 
NOX emissions reductions from on-road (1.55 tpd) and non-road (0.70 tpd) mobile sources will 
result from the application of VMEPs, including alternative commuting, regional traffic flow and 
vehicle retrofit and replacement, as well as non-road equipment measures.  The modeling 
sensitivity for VMEP was coupled with the HECT modeling sensitivity.  Table 3-25:  HECT and 
VMEP Modeling Sensitivity Results shows the DVFs at the Deer Park (CAMS 35), Houston 
Bayland Park (CAMS 53), and Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) (non-regulatory) monitors for the 
baseline as well as those resulting from both a 25 percent reduction in the HECT cap and a 2.25 
(1.55 on-road and 0.70 non-road) tpd VMEP reduction.

greater than 87 ppb, the recommended limit for weight-of-evidence considerations.

Nonattainment Area 
4.1  INTRODUCTION 
The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) nonattainment area for the 1997 eight-hour ozone National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), which consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, 
Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties, includes one of the most 
comprehensively controlled industrial complexes in the world.  The Texas Commission on 
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has developed stringent and innovative regulations that address 
nitrogen oxides (NOX), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and highly reactive volatile organic 
compounds (HRVOC).  Despite the significant decreases in ozone design values and emissions of 
ozone precursors in the HGB area, further reductions are necessary to bring the area into attainment 
of the 1997 eight-hour standard.  This chapter describes existing and proposed ozone control 
measures for the HGB area, as well as how Texas meets the following severe ozone nonattainment 
area state implementation plan (SIP) requirements: reasonably available control technology (RACT),

4.3  UPDATES TO EXISTING MEASURES

specifications under 30 TAC Chapter 117, while establishing a mandatory cap for total NOX 
emissions from affected source categories in the HGB ozone nonattainment area.  The MECT 
program was adopted as a primary control measure of the HGB attainment demonstration for the one-
hour NAAQS for ozone. 
 
The proposed revisi
nonattainment area cap by prohibit
he issuance of allowance allocations to major sources that did 
not submit the required Level of Activity Certification forms by the compliance date in 30 TAC  
§ 101.360.  This proposed rule change would not reduce the current NOX cap in the HGB 
nonattainment area. 
 
The MECT program allocated NOX emission allowances to applicable existing facilities in the HGB 
area based on their 1997 to 1999 levels of activity.  The program also prov
allocating allowances to facilities that had submitted administratively complete permit applications 
before January 2, 2001.  After January 2, 2001, any applicable new or modified facilities in the HGB 
area must acquire allowances equal to their annual NOX emissions (one NOX ton per year equals one 
annual allowance) from existing facilities already participating in the program. 
 
The current rule does not prohibit the issuance of new allowances to existing applicable facilities that 
failed to previously participate in the MECT program; therefore, an increase of the total NOX cap in 
the HGB ozone nonattainment area may occur in certain circumsta
The proposed rulemaking would prohibit these potential future increases in the MECT program NOX 
cap for maintenance of the HGB one-hour ozone attainment demonstration. Additionally, maintaining

pplicable facilities that failed to previously participate in the MECT program and previously

• 
new and modified facilities not in operation prior to January 1, 1997, but were included in 
a submitted New Construction or Modification Permit determined to be administratively 
complete before January 2, 2001; and  
• 
new and modified facilities not in operation prior to January 1, 1997, but qualified for a 
Permit by Rule and had commenced construction before January 2, 2001.   
 
This proposed rulemaking would also revise Chapter 101, Subchapter H, Division 3, to clarify the 
definition of “uncontrolled design capacity” as it relates to applicability of this division.  The TCEQ 
has received comments from stakeholders requesting clarification of the MECT program 
applicability, specifically relating to uncontrolled designed capacity and how it differs from a 
facility’s potential to emit.  The definition of “uncontrolled design capacity” would also be revised to 
allow owners or operators of emergency back-up engines at minor sources an alternative to using 
8,760 hours to calculate the uncontrolled designed capacity to emit for the engines.  Emergency back-
up engines at minor sites are typically authorized by Permit-by-Rul
le

engine while avoiding potentially making many minor sites needlessly subject to the MECT program 
solely because the engine is no longer exempt under Chapter 117.  Because these sites would still be 
subject to the Chapter 117 minor source rules in Subchapter D, Division 1, this proposed change does 
not constitute backsliding under the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA). 
 
4.3.2  Repeal of State Portable Fuel Container Rule 
The EPA adopted a federal portable fuel container (PFC) rule in the February 26, 2007, issue of the 
Federal Register (72 FR 8432) that set a national standard for gasoline, diesel, and kerosene PFCs.  
The rule requires all PFCs manufactured on or after January 1, 2009, to comply with the federal 
standards.  The new federal PFC regulations are consistent with the revised PFC regulations adopted 
by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on
re
PFC testing methods adopted by CARB in 2001.  Therefore, the state is proposing to repeal its PFC 
regulations (rule project number 2008-032-115-EN) and to rely on the implementation of the federal 
PFC regulations to control VOC emissions from PFCs used within the state.  According to an EPA 
analysis entitled, Federal Register Rule vs. Texas Register Rule Portable Fuel C
P
 
The repeal of the current Texas PFC regulations and reliance on the new federal PFC standards will 
not have a negative impact on the Texas SIP.  The estimated emission reductions applicable to the 
implementation of the federal PFC rule in Texas are expected to be equivalent to the current Texas 
PFC rule in the early years and to provide greater reductions in the later years. 
 
4.3.3  Cl
P
nonattainment areas with 1980 populations greater than 250,000 that are classified as serious or above 
for ozone.  In accordance with this requirement, a CFFP was instituted by rule in the HGB area 
beginning on September 1, 1998.  The CFFP requires that a certain percentage of fleet purchases after 
model year 1998 be Clean Fuel Vehicles (CFV) that meet the standards set forth in § 243 of the 
FCAA. 
 

 
The most recent federal standards
4-6 
 for both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles have eclipsed the CFV 
tandards because subsequent to September 1, 2005, any new vehicle purchase ranging from 0-26,000 
ill accomplish equal long-term reductions attributable 
 the CFFP.  However, the EPA has not provided guidance on how states are to address the Clean 
t federal 
le purchases subsequent to the date of repeal would meet more stringent 
 the eight-hour ozone standard, the HGB area is required to meet the mandates of the 
CAA under §§ 172(c)(1), 182(b)(2), and 182(f).  According to the EPA’s Final Rule to Implement 
 available control technology (BACT) levels 
xpected of new sources or to maximum achievable control technology (MACT) levels required for 
s
pounds gross vehicle weight rating would have either equaled or, in most cases, exceeded CFV 
standards.  In a letter to manufacturers (EPA, 2005), the EPA stated that “subsequent to publishing its 
CFV regulations, EPA has promulgated new emission standards that are generally more stringent than 
or equivalent to the CFV emission standards for light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty 
engines.”  This EPA letter, dated July 21, 2005, applied to fleet purchases that began with the 2006 
model year (September 1, 2005). 
 
During the 79th Texas Legislature Regular Session in 2005, Senate Bill 1032 was signed into law, 
which repealed the Texas Clean Fleet Program in its entirety because the federal standards already in 
place at that time eclipsed the CFV standards referenced in the FCAA.  On April 26, 2006, the TCEQ 
formally repealed the Texas Clean Fleet Program because no additional benefit could be achieved 
from new vehicle purchases under CFFP.  A revision to the SIP that reflected the repeal of the Texas 
Clean Fleet Program was submitted to the EPA on May 15, 2006.  EPA approval of measures that 
substitute for the initial requirement to implement CFFP is provided for in § 182(c)(4) of the FCAA 
as long as the EPA determines the substitute w
to
Fuel Fleet substitution requirement in their SIP submittals, in light of the more stringen
standards.  Since new vehic
federal emission standards, cancellation of the Texas Clean Fleet Program does not necessitate action 
to substitute this program with a separate emission reduction measure containing equivalent benefits.  
Such a substitution would only be warranted when a net increase in emissions would occur due to 
repeal or cancellation of an existing program. 
 
4.4  REASONABLY AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RACT) ANALYSIS 
4.4.1  General Discussion 
The HGB area is currently classified as a severe nonattainment area for the 1997 eight-hour ozone 
NAAQS.  Under
F
the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS (40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 51.912), states 
containing areas classified as moderate nonattainment or higher must submit a SIP revision 
demonstrating that their current rules fulfill the RACT requirements for all Control Technique 
Guidelines (CTG) categories and all non-CTG major sources of NOX and VOC.  The major source 
threshold for severe nonattainment areas is a potential to emit 25 tons per year (tpy) or more of either 
NOX or VOC.   
 
In the September 17, 1979, issue of the Federal Register (44 FR 53762) RACT is defined as the 
lowest emissions limitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of control 
technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility.  RACT 
requirements for nonattainment areas classified as moderate and higher are included in the FCAA to 
assure that significant source categories at major sources of ozone precursor emissions are controlled 
to a reasonable extent, but not necessarily to best
e
major sources of hazardous air pollutants.  While RACT and RACM have similar consideration 
factors like technological and economic feasibility, there is a significant distinction between RACT 
and RACM.  To be considered RACM, a control measure must advance attainment of the area 
towards meeting the NAAQS for that measure (see § 172(c)(1) of the FCAA).  Advancing attainment 
of the area is not a factor of consideration when evaluating RACT because the benefit of 
implementing RACT is presumed under the FCAA.   
 
Under the current state rules, the HGB area is subject to some of the most stringent NOX and VOC 
emission control requirements in the country, and for many source categories, the existing rules are 
more stringent than recommended RACT standards for those categories.  In the final approval notice 

 
for the revised HGB one-hour oz
4-7 
one attainment demonstration SIP published in the September 6, 
006, issue of the Federal Register (71 FR 52676), the EPA noted that the HGB VOC rules in 30

The EPA issued 11 Consumer and Commercial Products CTG documents between 2006 and 2008 
with recommendations for VOC controls on a variety of consumer and commercial products.  Some 
of the new CTG recommendations are updates to previously issued CTG documents and some are 
recommendations for new categories.  The TCEQ evaluated these new CTG documents in this RACT 
analysis to determine if additional VOC controls were necessary to fulfill RACT requirements.  The 
following is a list of the 11 CTG documents:

TAC Chapter 115 and NOX rules in Chapter 117 were previously determined to meet the FCAA 
RACT requirements.  Under the one-hour ozone NAAQS, the HGB area was also designated as a 
“severe” nonattainment area and the threshold for major stationary sources under the one-hour ozone 
nonattainment designation was identical to the current threshold under the eight-hour ozone 
designation.  Therefore, controls to satisfy RACT for most major sources under the eight-hour ozone 
designation were implemented by the TCEQ under

Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) source categories; and Table D-2: State Rules Addressing

the FCAA requirements for NOX RACT.  The MECT program and accompanying Chapter 117 rules 
represent one of the most comprehensive NOX control strategies in the nation and encompass both 
RACT and beyond-RACT levels of control.  Except for the EPA's Glass Furnace ACT document, the 
current EPA-approved Chapter 117 rules fulfill RACT requirements for all CTG and ACT NOX 
source categories.  For non-CTG/ACT major NOX emission source categories, RACT is fulfilled by 
the MECT program or by separate source-specific rules in Chapter 117 for sources that NOX controls 
are technologically and economically feasible. 
 
The TCEQ identified one major source glass manufacturing facility, Longhorn Glass Corporation 
(TCEQ Account No. HG-0028-R), in the 2006 point source emissions inventory for the HG

through the site's New Source Re
Longhorn's oxy-fired glass furnace to meet a NOX emission specification of 1.48 pounds per ton of 
glass produced.  This control requirement is more stringent than the current Chapter 117 NOX 
emissions specification of 4.0 pounds per ton of glass produced for glass furnaces that was approved 
by the EPA as part of the 2007 Dallas-Fort Worth eight-hour ozone attainment demonstration and is 
sufficient to satisfy RACT for the glass furnace category for the HGB

4.4.3.2  CTG Documents That Do Not Represent RACT for the HGB Area 
For the following three CTG documents, the TCEQ determined that the CTG recommendations either 
do not represent RACT due to economic or technological feasibility concerns or that the current 
Chapter 115 rules are equivalent or superior to the CTG-recommended controls: Fiberglass Boat 
Manufacturing Materials; Flexible Packaging Printing Materials; and Paper, Film, and Foil Coatings.  
Therefore, the TCEQ is not implementing any rule amendments or new rules associated with these

4.4.3.3  CTG Documents That a RACT Determination Cannot Be Made at This Time

initial assessment indicates that the EPA substantially underestimated the scope and potential impact 
of the CTG recommendations and that implementing the CTG recommendations would have 
widespread and potentially adverse impacts to small businesses and micro-businesses.  The TCEQ 
will continue to evaluate these CTG documents and plans to provide small business outreach to 
engage stakeholders that could be potentially impacted by the EPA's suggested control measures.  A 
RACT determination for these CTG categories will be made after adequate stakeholder input and the 
TCEQ has determined the impact to small businesses, economic and technological feasibility, and 
ractical enforceability of the CTG recommendations.

By letter dated December 8, 2008, the TCEQ requested clarification from the EPA regarding several 
issues related to the following three CTG documents: Large Appliance Coatings; Metal Furniture 
Coatings; and Miscellaneous Metal and Plastic Parts Coatings.  A number of the recommended VOC 
content limits for specific coatings categories in the CTG documents are less stringent than the more 
general VOC content limits specified in the EPA's original CTG recommendations.  The TCEQ 
requested clarification to assure that implementing the CTG recommendations would not be 
considered as backsliding and to be certain that the TCEQ has the appropriate information to 
determine whether the CTG recommendations actually represent RACT for Texas.  As of September 
4, 2009, the EPA has not responded to the TCEQ request for clarification on the CTG 
recommendations.  Therefore, the TCEQ is not making a determination at this time whether these 
CTG recommendations represent RACT for Texas until the EPA provides clarification to the issues

4.4.3.4  CTG Documents That Represent RACT for the HGB Area 
The TCEQ has determined that portions of the Offset Lithographic and Letterpress Printing CTG 
recommendations represent RACT for the HGB area.  Concurrent with this SIP revision, the TCEQ is 
proposing rulemaking to limit the VOC content of solvents used by offset lithographic printing 
facilities in the HGB area (Rule Project 2008-019-115-EN).  The proposed rulemaking would 
implement the CTG recommendations to reduce the VOC content of the fountain solutions and 
cleaning materials.  Additionally, the proposed rulemaking would expand the current rule 
applicability to include smaller sources not currently subject to the rule.  The TCEQ is not 
implementing any rule amendments or new rules associated with the CTG-recommended control 
requirements for heatset presses or with the letterpress printing portion of this CTG document for the 
GB area.  Additional discussion concerning the TCEQ's determination regarding the CTG

4.5  REASONABLY AVAILABLE CONTROL MEASURES ANALYSIS 
4.5.1  General Discussion 
States are required by § 172(c)(1) of the FCAA to “provide for implementation of all reasonably 
available control measures as expeditiously as practicable” and to include RACM analyses in the SIP.  
In the General Preamble for implementation of the FCAA Amendments of 1990 published in the 
April 16, 1992, issue of the Federal Register (57 FR 13498), the EPA explains that it interprets  
§ 172(c)(1) of the FC
a
obligated to adopt only those measures that are reasonably available for implementation in light of 
local circumstances.   
 
The TCEQ used a two-step process to identify potential control strategies for the HGB area RACM 
analysis.  The TCEQ compiled a list of potential control strategy concepts based on an initial 
evaluation of the existing control strategies and existing sources of VOC and NOX in the HGB area.  
Stationary sources outside the HGB area within either a 100 kilometer (km) or 200 km range of the 
HGB area were also considered for this initial evaluation. According to the EPA's guidance, sources 
of VOC must be within 100 km of the nonattainment area and sources of NOX must be within 200 
km.  The EPA allows states the option of considering control measures outside the ozone 
nonattainment area that can be shown to advance attainment; however, consideration of these sources 
is not a requirement of the FCAA.  Draft lists of potential control strategy concepts for stationary and 
mobile sources were developed from this initial evaluation.  The draft lists of potential control 
strategy concepts were presented to stakeholders for comment at stakeholder meetings held in the 
HGB area on March 25 and 26, 2008.  The TCEQ requested comment on the potential control 
strategies and invited stakeholders to suggest any additional strategies that might help advance 
attainment of the HGB area.  The final lists of

4.5.2  Results of RACM Analysis 
Based on the RACM analysis, the TCEQ determined that only one potential control measure met the 
criteria to be considered RACM.  A reduction in the HRVOC cap for Harris County under the HECT 
program was determined to help advance attainment of the HGB area and to meet the other RACM 
criteria.  Reported HRVOC emissions from sources in the HECT program during the first two years 
of the HECT program, calendar years 2007 and 2008, averaged approximately 56 percent of the total 
allocated HRVOC allowances for Harris County.  Because there is a demonstrated substantial surplus 
in the HRVOC cap, a 25 percent reduction in the cap for Harris County is technologically feasible 
and should have minimal economic impact.  Modeling demonstrates that a 25 percent reduction in the 
HRVOC cap for Harris County will help the HGB area make progress toward attainment of the 1997 
eight-hour ozone NAAQS.  Based on 2007-2008 emissions, a 25 percent reduction would leave a 
buffer of approximately 600 tpy, or more, in the cap that should be sufficient to account for any 
significant variations in HRVOC emissions in future years due to emission events and scheduled 
startup, shutdown, and maintenance events as well as allow for future economic growth.  Additional

The proposed revisions to the HECT Program Cap rule would result in a 25 percent reduction in the 
total HECT allowance cap and revise the HRVOC allocation methodology.  The HECT program was 
adopted by the commission as an ozone control measure for the HGB area on December 1, 2004.

Photochemical modeling analysis demonstrates that a 25 percent reduction of the HECT cap on the 
total Harris County HRVOC allocation would advance attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone 
NAAQS by reducing the future 2018 ozone design values (DV18s) at all HGB monitors.  Future 
design value calculations were based on 2006.  The largest decrease in the projected DV18s (0.24 ppb) 
was at the Deer Park monitor.  The average decrease for all sites was 0.11 ppb.  The three HGB 
monitors projected to be exceeding the eight-hour ozone NAAQS (i.e., DV18 > 84 ppb) in the 2018 
future case modeling, also exceed in the HECT sensitivity modeling.  The Wallisville monitor has the 
highest predicted DV18 (88.3 ppb) in the 2018 future case modeling, and continues to be the highest in 
the HECT sensitivity modeling (88.1 ppb)

HRVOC data from the first two years indicates that the total reported actual emissions from sources 
in the HECT program are approximately 50 percent of the total HRVOC cap.  Because the HRVOC 
rules in Chapter 115, Subchapter H, Divisions 1 and 2, require emissions from startup, shutdown, and 
maintenance activities be included in the HECT program, the total surplus observed in the first two 
years of the program cannot be removed.  Proposing a 25 percent reduction leaves a buffer in the cap

Following the initial allocation of allowances, companies participating in the HECT program

The rule revision proposes a new allocation methodology beginning with the 2011 calendar-year

proposed revised allocation methodology is based on calculating “uncontrolled” or “precontrolled” 
emissions for facilities using reported control efficiencies based on the specifications for flares in 
Chapter 115; creating a 250 ton emission event set aside pool to encourage market trading; and

4.6.2  Local Programs 
The H-GAC worked with HGB area local governments and business stakeholders to develop 
appropriate control strategies to meet the SIP requirements and to recruit stakeholders who would 
take legal responsibility for implementing these strategies through the establishment of memoranda of 
agreement.  As a result, six projects were identified as Transportation Control Measures (TCMs), and 
numerous strategies were agreed upon with local governments as voluntary measures.  For more

4.6.2.1  Transportation Control Measures 
TCMs are transportation projects and related activities that are designed to reduce on-road mobile 
source emissions and are included as control measures in the SIP.  Allowable types of TCMs are 
listed in § 7408 (Air Quality Criteria and Control Techniques) of the FCAA, and defined in the 
federal transportation conformity rule found in 40 CFR, Part 93 (Determining Conformity of Federal 
Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans).  The federal transportation conformity rule 
requires that timely implementation of TCMs be demonstrated.  In general, TCMs are transportation 
related projects that attempt to reduce vehicle use, change traffic flow, or reduce congestion 
conditions.  Projects that add single-occupancy-vehicle roadway capacity or are based on 
provements in vehicle technology or fuels are not considered to be TCMs.

The H-GAC has identified TCMs that have been or will be implemented in the nonattainment area.  
By the start of the 2018 ozone season, these TCMs will reduce NOX emissions in the HGB area by

Historically, federal mobile source control strategies have focused primarily on reducing emissions 
per mile through vehicle and fuel technology improvements.  Tremendous strides have been made 
resulting in new light-duty vehicle emission standards that are 70 to 90 percent less than that for the 
1970 model year.  However, mobile sources continue to constitute a significant portion of ozone 
precursor emissions in the HGB area due to population and employment growth as well as an increase 
in daily vehicle miles traveled per person.  Therefore, mobile source strategies that attempt to

A number of voluntary mobile source and transportation programs have already been initiated at the 
state and local levels in response to increasing interest by the public and business sectors in creating 
alternatives to traditional emission reduction strategies.  Some examples include economic and

action programs, and targeted public outreach.  These programs attempt to gain additional emissions

The H-GAC identified three voluntary measures that will aid in the improvement of the HGB region’s 
air quality.  These measures were identified through a contract between H-GAC and ENVIRON 
International Corporation.  Nineteen meetings were held with stakeholders from the region to solicit 
comments and suggestions for voluntary programs.  The H-GAC’s commitment for NOX from VMEP 
is 2.25 tpd.  The H-GAC, as the regional metropolitan transportation planning agency for the HGB 
area, has committed to make a good faith effort to implement the projects and/or programs outlined in 
this document and will be responsible for monitoring and reporting the emission reductions to the 
TCEQ.  More information on each of the VMEP commitments can be found in Appendix H:

4.7  Motor Vehicle Emissions Budget (MVEB) 
The MVEB refers to the maximum allowable emissions from on-road mobile sources for each 
applicable criteria pollutant or precursor as defined in the SIP.  The budget must be used in 
transportation conformity analyses.  Areas must demonstrate that the estimated emissions from 
transportation plans, programs, and projects do not exceed the MVEB.  The attainment budget 
represents the on-road mobile source emissions that have been modeled for the attainment 
demonstration.  The budget reflects all of the on-road control measures reflected in that 
demonstration.  The MVEB is shown in Table 4-2:  2018 Attainment Demonstration Motor Vehicle

4.8  MONITORING NETWORK 
States are required by 40 CFR, Part 58, Subpart B, to submit an annual monitoring network review to 
the EPA by July 1 of each year.  This network review is required to provide the framework for 
establishment and maintenance of an air quality surveillance system.  The annual monitoring network 
review must be made available for public inspection for at least 30 days prior to submission to the 
EPA.  The review, and any comments received during the 30 day inspection period, are then 
forwarded to the EPA for final review and approval.  The TCEQ posted this plan from June 1 through 
June 30, 2009.  The document presented the current Texas network of ambient air Photochemical 
Assessment Monitoring Station (PAMS) monitors as well as proposed changes to the network from 
uly 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010.

This network review includes posting of the TCEQ's EPA-approved PAMS Network Plan which 
focuses on ozone precursors.  The reclassification of the Houston ozone nonattainment area to severe 
requires one major change in the HGB area PAMS plan.  The TCEQ will conduct intensive carbonyl 
sampling at the Clinton PAMS Type 2 Site (AQS ID 48-201-1035) each year.  As agreed upon with 
the EPA, Region 6, the TCEQ will collect a total of 240 carbonyl samples at this site at a sampling 
frequency of eight 3-hour samples per day every three days during July-September.  Carbonyl 
sampling will be terminated at the Houston Channelview site to offset this increased sampling 
schedule at the Clinton site.  The 24 hour sample every sixth day carbonyl

4.9  CONTINGENCY PLAN 
SIP revisions for nonattainment areas are required by § 172(c)(9) of the FCAA to provide for specific 
measures to be implemented should a nonattainment area fail to meet reasonable further progress 
(RFP) requirements or attain the applicable NAAQS by the attainment date set by the EPA.  These 
contingency measures are to be implemented without further action by the state or the EPA.  In the 

 
General Preamble for implementation of the FCAA Amendments of 1990 published in the April 16, 
1992, issue of the Federal Register (57 FR 13498), the EPA interprets the contingency requirement to 
mean additional emissions reductions that are sufficient to equal up to 3 percent of the e
4-14 
missions in 
e adjusted base year inventory.  These emissions reductions should be realized in the year following 
our Ozone Nonattainment Area Reasonable Further Progress

The adjusted base year emissions inventory is used in the RFP planning process to calculate required 
emissions reduction targets and excludes certain on-road mobile source emissions reductions from 
controls that were promulgated prior to the 1990 amendments to the FCAA.  This 1997 eight-hour 
ozone attainment demonstration SIP revision also uses the adjusted base year inventory as the 
inventory from which to calculate the required 3 percent reduction for contingency.  For further 
information regarding the adjusted base year inventory for the HGB area and how the area meets RFP 
requirements, see the HGB 1997 Eight-H
S
attainment demonstration SIP revision.   
 
A summary of the 2019 contingency analysis is provided in Table 4-3:  2019 Contingency 
Demonstration for the HGB Area.  Consistent with the EPA’s NOX substitution guidance, the 3 
percent attainment demonstration contingency analysis for 2019 is based on a 2 percent reduction in 
NOX emissions (17.16 tpd) and a 1 percent reduction in VOC emissions (9.36 tpd) to be achieved 
between 2018 and 2019 (EPA, 1993).  Inventory analyses were performed on the fleet turnover 
effects for the federal emission certification programs for on-road and non-road vehicles.  The 
emission reductions from 2018 to 2019 were estimated for these programs.  For a detailed description 
of the contingency reductions, see Appendix 1:  HGB Reasona

Ms. Lisa Perez Jackson

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW 
Washington, DC 20460-0001 
Dear Ms. Perez Jackson, 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken. 
I 
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ 
air 
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and 
should be 
thrown out. 
That was a good first step. Now is the time for the EPA to 
take bold 
action by: 
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by 
TCEQ 
- 
utilizing TCEQ1s current illegal policy 
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired 
power 
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating 
under the 
Federal Clean Air Act standards 
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants - -  
no 
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing 
all 
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and 
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in 
accordance 
with the Federal Clean Air Act. 
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming 
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow 
existing 
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions. 

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants 
than any 
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on 
the top 
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past 
five 
years. Texans deserve better. We cannot let coal stand in the 
way of 
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules 
in 
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for 
their mess 
and that no permits issued under TCEQ1s illegal permitting 
process are

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQfs current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Please Enforce the US laws in Texas!
Since the state of texas is
flouting the Clean Air Act regulations-
we need the EPA to enforce the
laws for our health.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired- power plants than any

energy choice over its entire life cycle,
from from strip mine tailings
to power plant emissions.
Like many state environmental commissions,
the TCEQ all too often evades its mandated
regulatory function and
acts as a rubber stamp for industry ambitions.
Please hold them
accountable and ensure that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal
permitting process are allowed to proceed.
We need an energy future
that is not held hostage by the political power of the coal lobby.

Texas is a

More
coal plants in a state were our popultion is exploding is going to put
our children at risk.
My daughter will inherit a Texas where the
Hillcountry springs are dry because of the amount of water needed by
coal plants.
That water is needed for our growing population to use in
their homes as well as to keep our natural areas beautiful.
We don't
have the Colorado River to give us drinking water like the Western
states nor do we get teh rainfall keep our river clean and running.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards

applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air

thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
wi~h the Federal Clean Air Act.

TEXAS ASSOCIATION OF BUSINESS 
COMMENTS ON PROPOSED DISAPPROVAL OF TEXAS’ STANDARD PERMIT 
FOR POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECTS 
Docket ID No. EPA-R06-OAR-2006-0133 
74 Fed. Reg. 48,467 (September 23, 2009) 
 
Founded in 1922, the Texas Association of Business (TAB) is a broad-based, bipartisan 
organization representing more than 3,000 small and large Texas employers and 200 local 
chambers of commerce. TAB is providing the following comments on the proposal by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to disapprove the state implementation plan (SIP) 
submittals by the State of Texas related to New Source Review (NSR) reform as published in the 
Federal Register on September 23, 2009 [74 Fed. Reg. 48,467]. Although these comments are 
offered to that part of the proposed disapproval relating specifically to standard permits for 
pollution control projects, TAB is fully supportive of the comments provided to EPA in response 
to this and the other components of the NSR reform submittal subject to EPA’s proposed 
disapproval from its member companies, local chambers of commerce or the Texas Industry 
Project. 
TEXAS STANDARD PERMIT FOR POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECTS 
Under Texas’ air permitting program, every possible source of air contaminants is required to 
obtain some form of construction approval from the Texas Commission on Environmental 
Quality (TCEQ). The scope of this program far exceeds the federal requirements, applicable only 
to major sources. Texas has developed over time a variety of mechanisms for facility owners to 
obtain that approval. These mechanisms allow for balancing the procedure and depth of review 
and approval with such factors as facility type and complexity, magnitude and variability of 
emissions, and facility location. [Texas Clean Air Act §382.0518; 30 T.A.C. §116.110] 
In 1993, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), TCEQ’s predecessor 
agency, acted on recommendation of an advisory group to establish “a new category of new 
source review permits referred to as standard permits. The standard permit simplifies and 
accelerates the permit review process by establishing standardized conditions targeting a specific 
industry or type of facility.” [18 Tex. Reg. 8145, Nov. 9, 1993]. As originally adopted, the new 
Subchapter F, related to Standard Permits, included general conditions for claiming any standard 
permit and then codified each of the adopted standard permits. The first two codified standard 
permits were “for emission control projects required by rule and voluntary emission controls 
projects,” set forth as §§116.617(1) - (2), respectively. [19 Tex. Reg. 3055, 3063-3065, April 22, 
1994] 
At the time TNRCC proposed the standard permit rules and these specific standard permits for 
pollution control projects, it directly solicited EPA’s comments, especially on the provision of 
the rule related to delaying netting calculations for emission increases (and decreases) associated 
with the installation of emission controls. This provision would reduce administrative burdens, 
but much more importantly, avoid the possibility of delaying needed emission reductions from 
the pollution control projects due to triggering PSD review. [18 Tex. Reg. at 8146, Nov. 9, 1993] 
By the time TNRCC moved to act on its pending proposals, no formal written response or 
guidance had been received from EPA, however, TNRCC did consider informal communications 

 
2
that supported deferral of pollution control project emission changes from netting, so that 
standard permits could be used while avoiding delays from triggering PSD review. [19 Tex. Reg. 
at 3056, April 22, 1994]. TNRCC adopted the pollution control project standard permit, 
applicable to both required and voluntary emission reduction projects, more than 15 years ago. 
TNRCC also included separate standard permits specific to certain VOC and NOx control 
projects in 30 T.A.C. Chapters 115 and 117, respectively. At no point during the consideration of 
this permitting mechanism or in the ensuing 15 years did EPA inform TCEQ or its predecessor 
or any of the many industrial facilities attempting to meet emission reduction obligations of its 
position taken in the proposed disapproval that “[a] Standard Permit is a minor NSR permit 
limited to a particular narrowly defined source category for which the permit is designed to cover 
and cannot be used to make site-specific determinations that are outside the scope of this type of 
permit.” We are left to wonder why it took 15 years to arrive at this position or what new line of 
reasoning developed after 15 years to support it. 
The pollution control project standard permit was re-evaluated a few years later, when TNRCC 
proposed to add a provision [§116.617(1)] to allow the TNRCC Executive Director to object to 
the use of a standard permit if he determined that there were significant health effect concerns 
with its application or the representations made in claiming it. [21 Tex. Reg. 11,742, Dec. 6, 
1996]. The proposed rule changes also simplified the approach to emission netting by 
referencing the underlying federal standards. Again, EPA had no comment on any of these 
changes, and TNRCC adopted the relevant rule changes as proposed. [22 Tex. Reg. 4242, May 
22, 1997] 
The standard permit program was administered for another 8 years with no suggestion by EPA of 
any programmatic abuses and, more importantly, no examples given by anyone of unintended 
consequences. In fact, in what was considered as a clear signal of tacit approval and agreement 
(if not imitation) EPA in 2002 adopted PSD rules that expressly and comprehensively exempted 
pollution control projects from PSD review. [67 Fed. Reg. 80,185, 80,275-76, and 80,283-84, 
Dec. 31, 2002, and 40 C.F.R. §§52.21(b)(2)(iii)(h), 52.21(b)(32), and 52.21(z)]. EPA did so by 
defining “modifications” to exclude collateral emission increases associated with pollution 
control projects. After a 2005 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision invalidated that portion of 
EPA’s PSD reform rules [New York v. EPA, No. 02-1387 (D.C. Cir. June 24, 2005)], TCEQ 
immediately proposed to amend its rules to make clear that only collateral increases below PSD 
thresholds would be allowed under the standard permit for pollution control projects. [30 Tex. 
Reg. 6184, Sept. 30, 2005] 
 
Thirteen years after Texas adopted its pollution control project standard permit, EPA did finally 
offer comments on it. Curiously, none of those comments sounded anything like the statement 
“[a] Standard Permit is a minor NSR permit limited to a particular narrowly defined source 
category for which the permit is designed to cover and cannot be used to make site-specific 
determinations that are outside the scope of this type of permit.” Rather, EPA made various 
suggestions and asked various questions, to which TCEQ provided clear and complete responses. 
 
For example, EPA suggested that TCEQ not make any changes until the outcome of litigation 
was settled, however, TCEQ correctly noted that the New York decision affected only PSD 
review, a subject not addressed in the state rule, and that litigation, appeals and interpretation of 
court decisions could take considerable time. The TCEQ decided, again correctly, that its 
authorization of significant and necessary projects to reduce air emissions could not justifiably 

 
3
be delayed for the period of time required for EPA to reach some certainty in its interpretations. 
In fact, it should be clear at this point that the wait for certainty can be long, indeed, and the 
outcome still not certain. [31 Tex. Reg. 529, Jan. 27, 2006] 
 
In comments on the 2005 proposed amendments to the pollution control project standard permit 
rule EPA asked questions about whether the increases resulting from projects could interfere 
with attainment or maintenance of NAAQS and how the pollution control project standard 
permit complies with the public participation requirements of 40 CFR §51.161. TCEQ answered 
those questions by directing EPA to the specific sections of the rule that directly addressed those 
issues. TCEQ similarly addressed another concern from EPA by acknowledging that any 
construction under the pollution control project standard permit is undertaken at the risk of the 
party claiming the permit. [31 Tex. Reg. 530-531, Jan. 27, 2006]. Nowhere in the EPA comments 
does one find a hint of any categorical disapproval of the pollution control project standard 
permit or support for EPA’s announcement three years later that it could not approve even the 
concept of a standard permit for pollution control projects. 
 
PROPOSED DISAPPROVAL HAS NO FOUNDATION IN RULE OR LAW 
 
In spite of years of opportunity, and having never expressed any comments on the pollution 
control project standard permit that was not satisfactorily addressed, EPA now proposes to 
disapprove the this critical element of TCEQ’s minor source permitting program. Rather than an 
analysis or even recitation of the legal basis for this decision, we have only the statement: “A 
Standard Permit is a minor NSR permit limited to a particular narrowly defined source category 
for which the permit is designed to cover and cannot be used to make site-specific 
determinations that are outside the scope of this type of permit.” One searches for a reference to 
the statute or rule that supports these categorical statements about what a State permitting 
authority can or cannot do with “Standard Permits.” Those references are not found. In fact, the 
applicable statutes and rules say nothing about “standard permits” at all, because they are 
mechanisms TCEQ created under authority granted by the Texas Clean Air Act. In the absence 
of any valid legal basis, the EPA proposal can only be considered to be arbitrary and capricious. 
The pollution control project standard permit is consistent with applicable legal 
requirements 
 
There is one statute that governs EPA approval of the standard permit as a SIP revision and that 
is the following general obligation under §110(a)(2)(C) of the federal Clean Air Act: 
Each [SIP] shall… 
 (C) include a program to provide for … regulation of the modification and 
construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as 
necessary to assure that national ambient air quality standards are achieved, 
including a permit program as required in parts C and D… 
EPA does not (and cannot) question that TCEQ’s minor NSR program, including the standard 
permit for pollution control projects, “provides for the regulation of any stationary source as 
necessary to assure that national ambient air quality standards are achieved,” and Parts C (PSD) 
and D (nonattainment NSR) are not implicated because the pollution control project standards 

 
4
permits are expressly made unavailable to the major sources and major modifications that are 
subject to Parts C and D. 
Nor is there any EPA rule that governs approvable standard permits. Consistent with the general 
obligation simply to have some form of minor NSR program in an approvable SIP [CAA 
§110(a)(2)(C)], as well as the overriding Congressional finding “that air pollution prevention 
(that is, the reduction or elimination, through any measures, of the amount of pollutants produced 
or created at the source) and air pollution control at its source is the primary responsibility of 
States and local governments...” [CAA §101(a)(3)], EPA’s rule establishing the requirements for 
an approvable minor NSR program is quite basic and easily satisfied by the TCEQ minor NSR 
permits for pollution control projects. EPA’s disapproval notice identifies no respect in which the 
pollution control project standard permit, as an element of TCEQ’s minor NSR program, fails to 
meet this rule.  
 
The following presents the complete text of the applicable EPA rule governing the review of a 
state’s minor NSR program (40 C.F.R. §51.160), with observations inserted (in italics) about 
how TCEQ’s minor NSR program (including the pollution control project standard permit under 
that program) satisfies each provision of SIP approvability: 
 
 
§ 51.160   Legally enforceable procedures. 
 
(a) Each plan must set forth legally enforceable procedures that enable the State or local 
agency to determine whether the construction or modification of a facility, building, 
structure or installation, or combination of these will result in— 
 
Section 382.0518 of the Texas Clean Air Act and 30 T.A.C. § 116.110 require 
each facility and modification to receive some form of review, whether permit-by-
rule (PBR), standard permit, minor NSR permit, or full-blown NSR permit with 
PSD review. Failure to obtain the proper form of authorization is legally 
enforceable by the array of mechanisms available under the Texas Clean Air Act. 
(1) A violation of applicable portions of the control strategy; or 
Section 116.615(10) makes any use of any standard permit contingent on 
“[c]ompliance with rules. Registration of a standard permit by a standard 
permit applicant constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement that the 
holder will comply with all rules, regulations, and orders of the 
commission issued in conformity with the TCAA and the conditions 
precedent to the claiming of the standard permit.” 
(2) Interference with attainment or maintenance of a national standard in the State 
in which the proposed source (or modification) is located or in a neighboring 
State. 
Section 116.615(1) makes any use of any standard permit contingent on 
“protection of health and property of the public,” and of course the 
standard permits for pollution control projects by definition are for 
pollution controls. In designing its minor NSR program, TCEQ has 

 
5
reasonable determined that such projects are unlikely to have adverse 
environmental effects, and EPA has provided no reason to question that 
determination. Nonetheless, TCEQ has gone so far as to include a “safety 
valve” in the pollution control project standard permit, by which its use is 
prohibited for any pollution control project for which TCEQ’s “executive 
director determines there are health effects concerns or the potential to 
exceed a national ambient air quality standard criteria pollutant or 
contaminant that results from an increase in emissions of any air 
contaminant until those concerns are addressed by the registrant to the 
satisfaction of the executive director..” [30 T.A.C. §116.617(a)(3)(B)]. 
(b) Such procedures must include means by which the State or local agency responsible 
for final decision-making on an application for approval to construct or modify will 
prevent such construction or modification if— 
Any use of the pollution control project standard permits requires registration 
with TCEQ, and the opportunity for TCEQ to challenge the claimed use of the 
PCP. [30 T.A.C. §116.617(d)(1)] 
(1) It will result in a violation of applicable portions of the control strategy; or 
In addition to the precise directive of Section 116.615(10) (conditioning 
any standard permit user on compliance with otherwise applicable 
provisions of TCEQ’s control strategy), Sections 116.610(a)(3) & (4) 
specifically make use of any standard permit contingent on compliance 
with any applicable NSPS or NESHAP requirements. 
(2) It will interfere with the attainment or maintenance of a national standard. 
As noted above, Section 116.615(1) makes any use of any standard permit 
contingent on “protection of health and property of the public,” and of 
course the standard permits for pollution control project by definition are 
for pollution control. In designing its minor NSR program, TCEQ has 
reasonable determined that such projects are unlikely to have adverse 
environmental effects, and EPA has provided no reason to question that 
determination. Nonetheless, TCEQ has gone so far as to include a “safety 
valve” in the pollution control project standard permit, by which its use is 
prohibited for any pollution control project for which TCEQ’s “executive 
director determines there are health effects concerns or the potential to 
exceed a national ambient air quality standard criteria pollutant or 
contaminant that results from an increase in emissions of any air 
contaminant until those concerns are addressed by the registrant to the 
satisfaction of the executive director…” [30 T.A.C. §116.617(a)(3)(B)]. 
(c) The procedures must provide for the submission, by the owner or operator of the 
building, facility, structure, or installation to be constructed or modified, of such 
information on— 

 
6
(1) The nature and amounts of emissions to be emitted by it or emitted by 
associated mobile sources; 
(2) The location, design, construction, and operation of such facility, building, 
structure, or installation as may be necessary to permit the State or local agency to 
make the determination referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. 
Section 116.617(d)(2) of the pollution control project standard permit rule 
requires all of that information, and more: 
 
(2) The registration must include the following:  
(A) a description of process units affected by 
the project;  
(B) a description of the project;  
(C) identification of existing permits or 
registrations affected by the project;  
(D) quantification and basis of increases 
and/or 
decreases 
associated 
with 
the 
project, including identification of affected 
existing or proposed emission points, all air 
contaminants, and hourly and annual 
emissions rates;  
(E) a description of proposed monitoring 
and recordkeeping that will demonstrate 
that the project decreases or maintains 
emission rates as represented; and  
(F) a description of how the standard permit 
will be administratively incorporated into 
the existing permit(s). 
(d) The procedures must provide that approval of any construction or modification must 
not affect the responsibility to the owner or operator to comply with applicable portions 
of the control strategy. 
Section 116.615(10) of the TCEQ rules governing the use of any standard permit 
includes almost that exact language: “Registration of a standard permit by a 
standard permit applicant constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement that the 
holder will comply with all rules, regulations, and orders of the commission 
issued in conformity with the TCAA and the conditions precedent to the claiming 
of the standard permit.” 

 
7
(e) The procedures must identify types and sizes of facilities, buildings, structures, or 
installations which will be subject to review under this section. The plan must discuss the 
basis for determining which facilities will be subject to review. 
Section 116.617(a)(2) limits the use of the pollution control project standard 
permit to the following projects: 
 
(2) The project may include:  
(A) the installation or replacement of emissions 
control equipment;  
(B) the implementation or change to control 
techniques; or  
(C) the substitution of compounds used in 
manufacturing processes. 
The rule expressly excludes the following: 
 
(3) This standard permit must not be used to authorize the 
installation of emission control equipment or the 
implementation of a control technique that:  
(A) constitutes the complete replacement of an 
existing production facility or reconstruction of a 
production facility as defined in 40 Code of Federal 
Regulations §60.15(b)(1) and (c); or  
(B) the executive director determines there are 
health effects concerns or the potential to exceed a 
national ambient air quality standard criteria 
pollutant or contaminant that results from an 
increase in emissions of any air contaminant until 
those concerns are addressed by the registrant to 
the satisfaction of the executive director; or  
(C) returns a facility or group of facilities to 
compliance with an existing authorization or permit 
unless authorized by the executive director. 
In TCEQ’s various regulatory preambles over the years, it has made clear what 
this part of its SIP is intended to cover and accomplish, which is to streamline the 
authorization of emission reduction projects, a goal with which EPA cannot 
possibly disagree. This is especially true of emission reduction projects required 
by law. The question that should be very obvious is: How can the government 
both demand that a reduction occur and require permission to undertake the 
reduction through any but the most effective and streamlined process? 

 
8
(f) The procedures must discuss the air quality data and the dispersion or other air quality 
modeling used to meet the requirements of this subpart. 
(1) All applications of air quality modeling involved in this subpart shall be based 
on the applicable models, data bases, and other requirements specified in 
appendix W of this part (Guideline on Air Quality Models). 
(2) Where an air quality model specified in appendix W of this part (Guideline on 
Air Quality Models) is inappropriate, the model may be modified or another 
model substituted. Such a modification or substitution of a model may be made on 
a case-by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific State 
program. Written approval of the Administrator must be obtained for any 
modification or substitution. In addition, use of a modified or substituted model 
must be subject to notice and opportunity for public comment under procedures 
set forth in §51.102. 
 
TCEQ’s overall minor NSR program is quite specific about what modeling 
procedures are required, and under what circumstances. These are not at 
issue with the standard permit for pollution control projects. 
 
Guidance Memos are no Basis to Interfere with a State’s Minor NSR Program 
 
We find no basis in law for EPA to disapprove the standard permit for pollution control projects, 
and EPA provides none. EPA instead simply asserts that it cannot approve Texas’s standard 
permit for pollution control projects because “[a] Standard Permit is a minor NSR permit limited 
to a particular narrowly defined source category for which the permit is designed to cover and 
cannot be used to make site-specific determinations that are outside the scope of this type of 
permit.” We must assume EPA’s basis for this assertion is meant to be found somewhere in the 
EPA memos cited in a footnote that appears in this portion of EPA’s disapproval proposal, 
although it is hard to be sure given the complete lack of any discussion by EPA about how the 
memos affect its proposed decision to disapprove the pollution control project standard permits. 
Given the enormous significance of the action EPA proposes - to disapprove years late a 
longstanding element of the air permitting program that has produced unprecedented emission 
reductions in the nation’s largest industrial state, administered by the world’s second largest 
environmental regulatory agency - EPA has an obligation to provide to the many stakeholders 
affected by that decision a clear and convincing explanation. That clear and convincing 
explanation is not to be found. 
First, obscure memos written by long-departed mid-level EPA officials are not law, and cannot 
conceivably be used as an independent basis to deny approval of a SIP revision. Any EPA 
pronouncement that purports to be binding must be adopted through notice and comment 
rulemaking. [See Appalachian Power Company v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 2000)]. 
If EPA wants to make SIPs unapprovable if they have minor NSR programs that have “[a] 
Standard Permit [not] limited to a particular narrowly defined source category and…[that allow] 
site-specific determinations,” then it must adopt a rule that says so.  
Further, even if some memo could legally support EPA’s position, neither the memos cited, or 
any other we are aware of, actually do say so. If one goes through the considerable effort to find 
the cited memos (none were linked in the Federal Register so that one could readily find them 

 
9
and determine their relevance), one finds that they say nothing like “[a] Standard Permit is a 
minor NSR permit limited to a particular narrowly defined source category for which the permit 
is designed to cover and cannot be used to make site-specific determinations that are outside the 
scope of this type of permit.” In fact, they don’t speak to the requirements for an approvable 
minor NSR program under §51.160 at all. 
A review of the cited memos reveals nothing to suggest any intent to fill in gaps or qualify any 
provisions in §51.160. In fact, there is not a single cite to §51.160, the EPA rule governing the 
review of a state’s minor NSR program. That should surprise no one, for the simple reason that 
that is not the memos’ purpose, regardless of how EPA has chosen to cite them. As their subject 
lines alone inform the reader, they are for the sole purpose of elaborating on EPA’s consideration 
of mechanisms to limit potential to emit (PTE): 
Memo from Sietz to Regional Air Directors, “Approaches to Creating Federally-
Enforceable Emission Limits” (Nov. 3, 1993) 
Memo from Seitz and Van Heuvelen to EPA Regional Air Directors, “Options for 
Limiting the Potential to Emit (PTE) of a Stationary Source under Section 112 and Title 
V of the Clean Air Act (Act)” (Jan. 25, 1995) 
Memo from Stein to Regional Air Directors, “Guidance on Enforceability Requirements 
for Limiting Potential to Emit through SIP and §112 Rules and General Permits” (Jan. 
25, 1995) 
Memo from Seitz and Schaeffer, “Potential to Emit Guidance for Specific Source 
Categories” (Apr. 14, 1998) 
A mechanism to limit PTE for the purpose of avoiding PSD review is a subject entirely different 
from whether a particular mechanism for authorizing the installation of emission controls is an 
appropriate element of a State’s minor NSR program under CAA §110(a)(2)(C) and 40 C.F.R. 
§51.160.  
Unfortunately, EPA’s lack of any analysis as to how these memos influenced its proposal to 
disapprove the pollution control project standard permit requires commenters to speculate as to 
EPA’s “reasoning”: 
 “Approaches to Creating Federally-Enforceable Emission Limits” (Nov. 3, 1993 Memo 
from John Seitz to Regional Air Directors): This is the chronological first of the cited 
memos, the beginning of an emerging series on EPA thinking with regard to the question 
of how source owners could limit their PTE for purposes of avoiding Title V or Section 
112 major source status. As noted above, that is absolutely not the context in which EPA 
now cites the memo (as a basis for disapproving a component of TCEQ’s minor NSR 
program). And we find nothing in this memo that would support the propositions for 
which it is cited. But, ironically, it does contain some statements to support our 
objections to EPA’s pending proposal… 
The memo “encourage[s the states] to discuss program needs with their EPA Regional 
Offices. The OAQPS will work with them in addressing approvals.” The public record 
reveals a unilateral effort by TCEQ to craft a minor NSR program (of which the pollution 

 
10
control project standard permit is one small part) with little in the way of assistance or 
cooperation demonstrated by any EPA office. 
 
Adding more irony is the following statement: “States have flexibility in their choice of 
administrative process for implementation. In some cases it may be adequate for a State 
to apply these limits to individual sources through a registration process rather than a 
permit. A source could simply submit a certification to the State committing to comply 
with the term of an approved protocol.” Again assuming this memo were applicable to 
measures included within a minor NSR SIP, it would fully vindicate the function and 
application of TCEQ’s process for claiming a pollution control project standard permit.  
 
 The next chapter in EPA development of “Options for Limiting the Potential to Emit 
(PTE) of a Stationary Source under Section 112 and Title V of the Clean Air Act (Act)” 
is the January 25, 1995, Memo from John Seitz and Robert Van Heuvelen to EPA 
Regional Air Directors. Except to describe general permits as an option for limiting PTE 
for purposes of avoiding major source status under Section 112 and Title V, this memo 
contains nothing about what general permit can or cannot do, much less anything like the 
import EPA seeks to give it by its citation in the notice disapproving Texas’s pollution 
control project standard permit. 
 As an adjunct to the preceding statements of her colleagues on the program side of the 
Agency, Kathie Stein, then-Director of EPA’s Air Enforcement Division, issued to the 
Regional Air Directors her own “Guidance on Enforceability Requirements for Limiting 
Potential to Emit through SIP and §112 Rules and General Permits” (Jan. 25, 1995). As 
does her program colleagues’ memo of that same date, this one also addresses only the 
author’s expectations for limits on PTE. Even if this memo were applicable and binding 
(neither of which is the case), neither would it set any “requirements” not fully satisfied 
by TCEQ’s rule: In accord with the litany on page 10 of the Stein memo, the “general 
permit” does apply to a specific and narrow category of sources (pollution control 
projects); use of the permit requires notice to TCEQ; the permit includes verifiable limits 
(those set forth in the representations filed by the permit registrant); and use of the 
standard permit is at the risk of the user.  
 EPA’s next guidance on the subject of limiting PSD for Section 112 and Title V purposes 
comes three years later in a memo from John Seitz and Eric Schaeffer, “Potential to Emit 
Guidance for Specific Source Categories” (Apr. 14, 1998). Like its predecessors, this 
memo is “an information-sharing exercise” to identify for permitting authorities some 
options that EPA has identified for “creating PTE limits.” By its very terms, “[t]he 
policies set forth in this memorandum are intended solely as guidance, do not represent 
final Agency action, are not binding on any party, and cannot be relied upon to create 
any rights enforceable by any party.” Given the plain language of the memo, it is 
certainly unclear why and how EPA can cite it in support of a proposal to disapprove a 
SIP revision, which must depend on a finding that the SIP fails to meet an actual legal 
requirement 
Also, aside from its stated lack of legal effect, this memo - like the others - has no factual 
bearing on pollution control project standard permits. What it does is outline for the 
benefit of any interested state a way it might draft general permits for eight specific 

 
11
source categories, not including pollution control projects. TCEQ has permits by rule in 
Chapter 106 for these types of sources, and many others. The memo might inform a 
discussion of them, but it says absolutely nothing relevant to EPA approval of a standard 
permit for pollution control projects. 
 The last evidence from which we might derive some understanding of how EPA Region 6 
has come to disapprove TCEQ’s pollution control project standard permit is an EPA 
Region 7 white paper titled “Permit by Rule Guidance for Minor Source Preconstruction 
Permits” (Sept. 12, 2003). Ironically, instead of supporting any criticism of Texas’s 
standard permit for pollution control projects, this memo actually reflects and supports 
many of our preceding comments. 
 
First, it affirms that “[d]ecisions on approvability of particular rules will be based on the 
statutory and regulatory requirements, including section 110, in particular section 
110(a)(2)(C), and 40 CFR 51.160, which require the EPA to determine that the State has 
adequate procedures to ensure that construction or modification will not interfere with 
attainment of a National Ambient Air Quality Standard.” EPA’s citation of this memo 
only serves to highlight its complete failure to review Texas’s program on the basis of 
these applicable laws. 
 
Next, it affirms that the rest of the very memos cited in that long footnote were “not 
intended to affect minor new source review programs,” but to “provide insight into the 
process for devising potential-to-emit limits for small sources and creating generic 
potential-to-emit limits in prohibitory rules and general permits for numerous similar 
small sources in an industry.”  
 
The Region 7 guidance is intended to alert the states as to that Region’s expectations for 
permits by rule for “numerous similar small sources in an industry,” not standard permits 
for pollution control projects. TCEQ has many such PBR’s as a separate component of its 
minor NSR program, but those are not at issue in the present rulemaking. One would not 
expect a mechanism for authorizing hundreds of small boilers, for example, to meet the 
same criteria as a standard permit for emission control projects.  
 
Finally, even though the Region 7 guidance is both inapplicable (for many reasons) and 
nonbinding, Texas’s pollution control project standard permit nonetheless satisfies its 
criteria for evaluating “general permits” in all relevant respects.  
 
1. Pollution control projects necessarily help with NAAQS attainment, and yet the 
rule allows TCEQ to reject a registration if it finds that “there are health effects 
concerns or the potential to exceed a national ambient air quality standard criteria 
pollutant or contaminant that results from an increase in emissions of any air 
contaminant until those concerns are addressed by the registrant to the satisfaction 
of the executive director…” [30 T.A.C. §116.617(a)(3)(B)]; 
2. The sources covered (and not covered) are clearly delineated [§§116.617(a)(2) 
and (a)(3)]; 
 

 
12
3. The rule specifies that it is for reduction projects [§116.617(a)], and necessarily 
that any collateral increases must fall below major NSR thresholds [§116.610(b)]; 
4. The entire permit is in fulfillment of emission control objectives [§116.617(a)]; 
5. The rule specifies in detail the deadlines for registration with TCEQ 
[§116.617(d)]; 
6. The rule requires timely notification, and specifies the information that must be 
provided with the registration [§116.617(d)]; 
7. TCEQ provides acknowledgment of each registration, either by letter or by 
operation of law; 
8. The rule allows TCEQ to deny coverage based on case-specific circumstances 
[§116.617(a)(3)(B)] 
9. No mass balances are involved; 
10. The standard permit rule requires recordkeeping sufficient to show compliance 
with the terms of the standard permit [§116.617(e)(2)]; 
11. The rule also addresses monitoring requirements [§116.617(e)(2)]; 
12. There is no once-out, always-out provision in the rule (nor is any justified by 
applicable law), but any violation of the terms of a standard permit is subject to 
the array of enforcement options available to TCEQ, and the consistent inability 
to meet the terms of the standard permit inevitably would require the source to 
undergo the more suitable permitting process. 
13. Notification to TCEQ is required for any violation of the terms of the standard 
permit, at least if the pollution control project was authorized at a site that is 
subject to Title V permitting [30 T.A.C. § 122.145(2)]. 
It is with a sense of irony, then, that one reads the following invitation from Region 7: “States are 
encouraged to coordinate with the EPA at the earliest state of rule development.” TCEQ of 
course has been trying for years, specifically asking for EPA comments from the very first 
proposal. And even with its belated proposal to disapprove the rules, EPA has failed to provide 
any meaningful comments. 
EPA Actions on Other States’ Programs Provide no Basis for Disapproval of Texas’ 
Standard Permit for Pollution Control Projects 
 
The last thread in EPA’s citation of “authorities” are a series of Federal Register notices in which 
EPA has taken some action on other states’ minor NSR programs. Again, despite the enormity of 
the action that EPA proposes, it offers absolutely no explanation of how these particular actions 
illuminate its proposal to disapprove Texas’s standard permit for pollution control projects. 
 
Even if these Federal Registers notices presented EPA’s final decisions to disapprove identical 
provisions in the SIPs of all 49 other states, it would provide no valid authority for its proposal to 
do so in Texas: As noted above, and as recognized in several of the memos that EPA itself cites, 
only validly adopted EPA rules can define the legal basis for action to approve or disapprove a 
SIP. Invalid action on 49 other SIPs doesn’t excuse number 50. And regardless of the lack of 

 
13
their applicability, the absence of EPA analysis leaves us without any meaningful basis to 
comment on the extent to which these other states’ programs were sufficiently similar to Texas’s 
as to warrant consideration. Our own analysis reveals that they do not. 
 
None of the referenced SIP revisions involved standard permits for pollution control projects at 
all and none involved disapprovals based on any failure to meet applicable legal requirements for 
minor NSR SIPs, or in fact disapprovals of any kind. Instead, they were simply EPA actions in 
which it applied the “criteria “ of the above-discussed guidance memos on limiting PTE for some 
specific source categories in order to conclude that the state’s suggested means of limiting PTE 
from those source categories were approvable. [61 Fed. Reg. 53,633 (Oct. 15, 1996), approving 
Knox County, TN, permits-by-rule for eight specific source categories under the criteria 
described in the January 15, 1995 memos); 62 Fed. Reg. 2587 (Jan. 17, 1997), approving Florida 
“exclusionary rules” to allow some specific source categories “to compute potential emissions 
based on actual emission or raw material usage”; 71 Fed. Reg. 5979 (Feb. 6, 2006), approving 
Wisconsin “general and registration permits” under the criteria of the previously cited guidance 
memos]. Prior applications of non-binding guidance memos on an unrelated subject to different 
programs to reach an opposite conclusion adds nothing to EPA’s case for disapproving Texas’s 
pollution control project standard permit rule. 
 
No Evidence of Standard Permit Program Failure or Adverse Consequence 
 
There is only one legal requirement for approval of Texas’s standard permit for pollution control 
projects that hasn’t been met, and that is EPA’s obligation to have acted on the SIP submittal 
long before 2009. EPA has also failed to take advantage of the intervening period, during which 
time TCEQ has been authorizing pollution control project standard permits, to review the 
available records to determine negative consequences as a result of this “unapprovable” 
permitting mechanism or find some evidence that the standard permit for pollution control 
projects has somehow caused TCEQ’s minor NSR program to fail to advance the goal of 
NAAQS attainment. But EPA offers not one example of a pollution control project standard 
permit that failed to protect public health or welfare, or that couldn’t be enforced, or that didn’t 
accomplish its valuable and necessary purpose of quickly but carefully authorizing emission 
reduction projects. EPA’s inability or even lack of effort to do so says far more about the 
approvability of the program than a few unsupported paragraphs about allegedly unmet legal 
“requirements” say about its disapprovability. 
  
The trade press reports that EPA is now undertaking investigations and file reviews to uncover 
actual abuses and failures of the TCEQ air permitting program. TCEQ and the regulated 
community have been waiting for a response from EPA on some parts of that program for 15 
years - 14 years past the time that EPA should have been heard from. To undertake 
investigations or file reviews to try to find evidence of any deficiencies in Texas’ air permitting 
program after publishing a proposal to disapprove that same program does not reflect well on 
EPA’s legal and technical justification, its objectivity, or good faith in working with the State of 
Texas to ensure that no obstacles are placed in the way of proven measures to protect and 
improve our air quality."

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act l
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ1s current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old l
dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in' emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ1s illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth,
creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
This is not a legacy we Texans want to leave for future generations to
deal with.

As a side note,
I voluntarily moved away from a homestead where Alcoa
had been allowed to open a new lignite mine, illegally, but with George
Bush1s approval because they donated to his presidential campaign.
I
and many of my close friends developed thyroid malfunctions after this
mine opened.
If you think about it, unearthing thousand year old
buried gases along with the lignite may just be hazardous to everyone1s
health.
Studies have been performed in Papua New Guinea on the
endocrynological effects of lignite mining,
but of course none in the
U.S.
The TCEQ is complicit with the local companies they are charged

They need a

It's time to enforce the Clean Air Act in Texas

Mr. Stanley Spruiell
Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Big business and special interests in Texas make sure our state places
no priority on the health of its residents.  Please help our state live
up to the minimum protections of its air, water, and land.
Respectfully,
Eric Casey

Texas has great, potential for green energy alternatives.
The state
also has a lot of money_
There is no reason for circumventing Clean
Air Act Standards except for pure greed, and/or the attitude that says,
""We don!t need anyone tellin'
us what to do"".
Safe business
practices must be a part of good business or the business should not be
allowed.
The EPA has done many beneficial things for the citizens of
this country and it is a necessity to keep it strong and safe-guarding
healthy environments and ecological systems.
Don't let an elite group
of ""good-old-boysll
think that they can push around the EPA or their regulations.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.  Texans deserve better.  We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.  Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
Sincerely,

I.  Introduction 
 
Texas’ New Source Review (NSR) permitting rules are inconsistent with and less 
stringent than federal NSR permitting requirements and should be disapproved. While states 
have discretion to select the best methods for achieving the specific emission reductions included 
within their State Implementation Plans (SIPs), they must follow the procedural permitting 
requirements specified in the Clean Air Act and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 

2 
 
regulations. Alaska Dept. Envt’l Conservation v. EPA, 540 U.S. 461, 470 (2004).  EPA’s 
regulations clearly require states to either adopt the federal regulations verbatim or to submit a 
demonstration that the state’s program is at least as stringent as the federal program.  67 
Fed.Reg. 80241 (Dec. 31, 2002).   
Texas’ air permitting rules are inconsistent with federal permitting requirements, and 
Texas has made no demonstration that the rules are at least as stringent as the federal program.  
In fact, Texas’ failure to adopt adequate permitting requirements results in substandard pollution 
controls, more pollution, and a permitting program that lacks transparency and is largely 
unenforceable.  In addition, Texas’ current permitting rules represent a general weakening of 
existing SIP requirements, and fail to meet basic SIP enforceability, replicability, and 
accountability standards. 42 U.S.C. §7515, 57 Fed.Reg. 13498, 13568-- (April 16, 1992).We, 
therefore, urge the EPA to finalize disapproval.  
Because EPA’s obligations under the Clean Air Act extend beyond merely ensuring the 
adequacy of SIP permitting provisions, disapproval of the Texas NSR rules alone is inadequate 
to create a comprehensive and efficient remedy.1   To assure protection of National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards (NAAQS), EPA must ensure that states adequately implement and enforce 
their SIPs.  42 U.S.C. §§ 7410(a)(2)(E), 7509(a)(4).  Texas is neither implementing nor is it 
enforcing its SIP.  Instead, it is implementing and enforcing state rules, and associated guidance, 
that have not been SIP-approved and that, in many instances, fails to meet Clean Air Act 
minimum standards.  As a result, there are thousands of Texas emission authorizations that are 
                                                             
1 Ensuring the adequacy of Texas’ SIP rules will require EPA to finalize its proposed disapprovals of Texas 
Qualified Facility and Flexible Permit rules and to take action on the numerous Texas minor NSR emission 
authorization mechanisms that violate federal law, render the permitting program practicably unenforceable and 
thwart public participation.

inconsistent with federal law and fail to meet minimum public participation, enforceability, and 
emission reduction requirements. Further, despite EPA’s proposed disapproval – and clear notice 
that the NSR reform rules are not SIP-approved – TCEQ continues to issue new permits to 
sources pursuant to its non-SIP approved rules. 
For example, approximately 4,000 megawatts of new coal, lignite, and petroleum coke-
fired power generation is currently under construction in Texas.  Another roughly 5,000 
megawatts is being contested in the TCEQ’s contested permitting process.  Measured against the 
approximately 22,000 megawatts of existing solid fossil fuel-fired electric generation, which was 
built mostly in the 1970’s and early 1980’s, this recent surge of new power plants represents a 
major increase in emissions of several key pollutants of concern.  All of these recently issued 
permits and draft permits suffer from any number of preconstruction permit deficiencies, due to 
TCEQ’s lax permitting requirements.  A few examples include: 
• The L.S. Power Sandy Creek power plant (currently under construction) obtained a 
Flex Permit.  The plant has yet to undergo a case-by-case MACT Determination. 
 
• The NRG Limestone Unit 3 permit, and several other new power plant permits, rely 
blindly on the PM 2.5/PM 10 surrogacy policy, without any case-specific PM 2.5 
analysis, over EPA’s clear objection. 
 
• The White Stallion Energy Center, just outside the Houston nonattainment area, 
was issued a draft permit without a meaningful ozone modeling analysis. 
 
• The TCEQ Executive Director continues to support issuance of permits – for 
example, the NRG Limestone Unit 3, Coleto Creek, and Las Brisas Energy Center – 
where modeling using the applicant’s own inputs shows evidence of existing PSD 
increment violations.  TCEQ may not issue these permits without taking the 
required steps to corroborate and mitigate ambient air problems. 
 
• All the new power plants have undergone a BACT analysis based on Texas’ 
problematic “3-Tier” BACT guidance. 
 

4 
 
 
To fulfill its statutory duty to protect air quality, EPA must require Texas to follow its 
approved SIP and correct implementation deficiencies. The Clean Air Act includes a SIP call as 
the remedy for a state’s failure to adequately implement and enforce its SIP. 42 U.S.C. 
§§7410(k)(5), 7509(a)(4).  EPA should issue a SIP call to Texas, requiring the state to 
immediately implement the approved SIP, and putting the state on a timeline to develop a 
comprehensive fix for its program, considering legal implementation and enforcement 
deficiencies. In addition, Texas must develop a clear process for addressing its backlog of 
permits that are inconsistent with the SIP. 
II. History of Texas NSR Reform 
Texas has been on notice for years regarding the deficiencies with its NSR rules.  At the 
time the state adopted its NSR Reform rules, EPA filed 21-pages of detailed comments 
identifying specific deficiencies with the draft rules.2 These included: 
1) The failure of the definition of “baseline actual emissions” to include emissions 
associated with maintenance, startups, and shutdowns up to the source’s allowable 
limitation; 
2) The failure to base prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) and NSR applicability 
determinations on the attainment status of an area on the date of permit issuance;  
3) The establishment of independent plant-wide applicability limit (PAL) permits and of 
PALs in flexible permits, rather requiring PALS to be included in federally enforceable 
permits; 
4) The failure to require PALs to include all emission units at a source that emit a PAL 
pollutant; 
5) The failure to require sources to comply with applicable Federal or State requirements, 
emission limitations and work practice requirements that were established prior to the 
effective date of the PAL; 
                                                             
2 “Comments on Proposed Revision to Adopt New Source Review (NSR) Reform Rules Project Number 2005-010-
116-PR” from David Neleigh, EPA Region 6, Chief Air Permits Section, to Joyce Spencer, TCEQ, Office of Legal 
Services (Oct. 28, 2005) (Attachment 1).

6) The failure to limit emission increases above the PAL limit to situations where the 
source would not be able to maintain emissions below the PAL level even if you assumed 
application of BACT equivalent controls on all existing major and significant units; 
7) The failure to specify adequate requirements for PAL applications; 
8) The failure to require adequate monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting for the PAL; 
9) The failure to require adequate public participation for the PAL; 
10) The general failure to Texas’ public participation rules to meet federal standards; 
11) The failure to mandate adequate public participation, specifically public notice, for 
emissions increases in PCP standard permits; and 
12) The failure to trigger enforcement and review of PCPs before construction or 
installation has begun.3  
 In addition, EPA stated in its letter: 
We cannot approve State regulations that differ from the corresponding Federal 
regulations if you do not provide an equivalency demonstration.  In the 
equivalency demonstration, the State should demonstrate that the revision will not 
interfere with attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS), Rate of Progress (ROP), RFP or any other applicable requirement of 
the CAA.4 
The TCEQ failed to address many of EPA’s comments, which now serve as the basis for EPA’s 
proposed disapproval, and Texas did not submit an equivalency demonstration for its rules. 
III. Legal Deficiencies with Texas’ NSR Reform SIP Submittal 
A. PSD Deficiencies 
1.  TCEQ illegally deleted the federal definition of Best Available Control Technology 
(BACT) from its rules.  
 
 
As EPA stated in its proposal, BACT “constitutes a central requirement of the [Clean 
Air] Act.” TCEQ’s deletion from its rules of the federal BACT definition and substitution of a 
definition that is less rigorous is a relaxation of the current SIP, and is inconsistent with the Act.  
As the Environmental Appeals Board recently stated:

Not merely an option gathering exercise with casually considered choices, the 
NSR Manual or any BACT analysis calls for a searching review of industry 
practices and control options, a careful ranking of alternatives, and a final choice 
able to stand as first and best.  If reviewing authorities let slip their rigorous look 
at “all” appropriate technologies, if the target ever eases from the “maximum 
degree of reduction” available to something less or more convenient, the result 
may be somewhat protective, may be superior to some pollution control 
elsewhere, but it will not be BACT.5 
 
Texas’ failure to utilize an adequate definition of BACT as part of its PSD permitting 
process means that Texas facilities are allowed to emit more than their counterparts in 
other states and that air quality is unnecessarily, and illegally, degraded. 
 
a.  Federal BACT Requirements: 
The Clean Air Act defines BACT as: 
 [A]n emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each 
pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter emitted from or which results 
from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-
case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and 
other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of 
production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques . . . . In no 
event shall application of 'best available control technology' result in emissions of 
any pollutants which will exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable 
standard established pursuant to section 7411 or 7412 of this title [emission 
standards for new and existing stationary sources]. 
 
 42 USC § 7479(3).  EPA’s regulatory definition of BACT is almost identical to the 
statutory definition.  40 CFR §52.21(b)(12).  EPA BACT guidance highlights five essential steps 
in a BACT determination: 
Step 1: Identify all control technologies . . . Step 2: Eliminate technically 
infeasible options. A demonstration of technical infeasibility should be 
clearly documented . . . Step 3: Rank remaining control technologies by 
control effectiveness . . . Step 4: Evaluate most effective controls and

PSD Appeal No. 08-02.

document results . . . if top option is not selected as BACT, evaluate next 
most effective option control. Step 5: Select BACT.6   
  
This approach has come to be known as a “top-down” analysis.  The Environmental 
Appeals Board has repeatedly held that while a state BACT analysis need not exactly follow the 
top-down approach, it must include consideration of the same factors in the same level of detail.7  
Texas BACT definition and its application fail to meet these minimum standards. 
b.  Texas BACT requirements: 
Although the current Texas SIP incorporates the federal definition of BACT by reference, 
Texas has deleted incorporation of the federal definition from its rules and now relies on its own 
definition of BACT when issuing PSD permits.  This is despite the prior EPA determination that 
Texas BACT was less stringent than federal BACT. 54 Fed.Reg. 52823 (Dec. 22, 1989). The 
current Texas rules define BACT as follows:  
Best available control technology (BACT)--BACT with 
consideration given to the technical practicability and the 
economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating emissions 
from the facility. 
 
30 TAC § 116.10(3).   
Rather than implementing EPA’s top-down approach, the TCEQ has issued a “three-tier” 
guidance that its employees are to follow in determining BACT.8  The first tier in Texas 
guidance “involves a comparison of the applicant’s BACT proposal to emission reduction 
                                                             
6 Environmental Protection Agency, New Source Review Workshop Manual, B.1-B.9 (October 1990)(Attachment 
2). 
7 See, In re: General Motors, Inc., 2002 EPA App. LEXIS 2 (March 6, 2002); PSD Appeal No. 01-30, p. 9 (“… a 
strict application of the methodology described in the NSR manual is not mandatory.  Nevertheless, in evaluating the 
rationality and defensibility of BACT determinations by permitting authorities, the Board has required an analysis 
that reflects a level of detail in the BACT analysis comparable to the methodology in the NSR Manual.”

Permit Applications, 1, 2 (April 2001) RG-383.  (Attachment 3).

performance levels accepted as BACT in recent permit reviews.”9 The second tier “involves 
consideration of controls that have been accepted as BACT in recent permits for similar air 
emission streams in a different process or industry.”10  Tier three is a “detailed technical and 
quantitative economic analysis of all emission reduction options available for the process under 
review.”11  According to TCEQ, its BACT determination “begins at the first tier and continues 
sequentially through subsequent tiers only if necessary.”12  TCEQ Guidance indicates that “Tier 
III evaluation is rarely necessary,” and that “[o]rdinarily, it is in the best interest of both the 
applicant and [TCEQ] to avoid the third tier of evaluation.”13  
The Texas definition and implementation of BACT are insufficient for a number of 
reasons. First, the Texas definition is circular. Fundamentally, the definition provides that 
“BACT is BACT.” A circular definition is meaningless; thus BACT determinations in Texas 
become arbitrary and incomparable to the intent of the federal definition. Second, it does not 
include the requirement that the emission limitation must be based upon “the maximum degree 
of reduction” that is “achievable,” a key tenet of the idea of BACT as required by the Clean Air 
Act. 42 U.S.C. § 7479(3).  Third, it does not include the requirement that BACT must be derived 
through a case-by-case process. Fourth, it does not include the requirement that in determining 
BACT, there must be a consideration of “production processes or available methods, systems, 
and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques.” 
Id.  Fifth, it does not include the requirement that energy and environmental impacts be

considered in establishing the emission limit. Sixth, it alters the federal definition by 
emphasizing consideration of “technical practicability” and “economic reasonableness.” 30 TAC 
§116.10(3).  This departure from application of the federal BACT definition skews the BACT 
analysis in favor of weaker emission standards that are less burdensome to PSD applicants.  As a 
result, Texas’ implementation of BACT fails to fulfill the technology forcing intent of the Clean 
Air Act and results in weaker emission limitations – and thus more pollution – that would be 
achieved through implementation of the federal definition.  
The Texas “three-tier” BACT Guidance exacerbates the deficiencies with the Texas 
BACT definition.  Congress created BACT as a technology-forcing measure, to compel the 
“rapid adoption of improvements in technology as new sources are built.” Senate Report on 
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, S. Rep. No. 95-127, 29 (1977).   By making the first, and 
only necessary, step of the three-tiered guidance a review of technologies that are already in 
existence, the Texas rules thwart the technology-forcing intent of BACT.  Texas’ reliance on 
emission limits established in other permits merely perpetuates what has gone before; emission 
limits will not keep pace with technological advancement. 
Texas’ guidance specifies that conducting only the first step of the three-tiered guidance 
is appropriate “if no new technical developments have been made that indicate additional 
reductions are economically or technically reasonable.”14  In practice, TCEQ interprets this as 
requiring only a look at known technologies, often only those technologies identified in EPA’s 
RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, and not the wide-ranging technologies being developed and 
implemented all over the country.  See Attachment 4 (excerpts from permitting proceedings 
related to BACT). 
                                                             
14 TCEQ Guidance, Evaluating Best Available Control Technology (BACT) in Air Permit Applications at 3. 

10 
 
Even state administrative law judges have recognized that Texas’ implementation of BACT 
is questionable, but they have felt constrained to follow TCEQ’s policies: 
“Although the ALJs somewhat agree that the EPA’s top-down BACT approach may 
be better designed to be technology-forcing, the ALJs also conclude that the TCEQ’s 
tiered methodology is the proper method for analyzing BACT in this case. Although 
there may be legitimate concerns with whether the TCEQ‘s three tier BACT 
methodology actually ensures the technology-forcing purposes behind the BACT 
requirement, the methodology has been approved by the Commission in prior cases. 
Specifically, this same methodology has been used by the TCEQ in evaluating BACT 
at least since 2001, when the guidance document was issued.”15 
The EPA Environmental Appeals Board has repeatedly held that the failure to consider 
all potentially applicable control alternatives in a BACT analysis is clear error.16  TCEQ’s 
removal of the federal definition of BACT from its SIP is a violation of the Clean Air Act’s anti-
backsliding provision in U.S.C. §7515.  Due to the insufficiency of the state definition and 
implementation of BACT, and the importance of BACT as an integral part of PSD permitting 
and maintenance of the NAAQS, EPA should issue a final disapproval of the deletion of the 
federal definition of BACT and should start a sanctions clock.  In addition, EPA must take 
immediate action to ensure that Texas is properly implementing the federal, SIP-approved 
definition of BACT, including rejecting Texas’ use of its current BACT guidance. 
2.  TCEQ’s rules fail to prohibit the relaxation of enforceable limits consistent with 40 
CFR §52.21(r)(4). 
 
The federal regulations state that if a project becomes a major stationary source or major 
modification solely because of a relaxation of an enforceable limitation on the source or 
modification’s capacity to emit a pollutant, then the source or modification is subject to PSD as

Permit PSD-TX-1072, and MACT HAP-14 Permit, June 23, 2009, Page 24.

if construction had not yet commenced. 40 CFR §52.21(r)(4).  The goal of this provision is to 
prevent sources from using “sham operational limits” to avoid PSD.  The currently approved 
Texas SIP incorporates this federal requirement by reference at 30 TAC §116.160(a).  In 2006, 
Texas revised its rules and eliminated incorporation by reference of 52.21(r)(4). EPA should 
finalize disapproval of this deletion.  Section 52.21(r)(4) provides an extra deterrent to facilities 
that might take limits they know they cannot achieve n order to avoid federal permitting 
requirements.  Approval of Texas deletion of this provision would violate the anti-backsliding 
provisions of 42 U.S.C. §7515 and would render the Texas SIP less stringent than federal 
requirements and inadequate for preventing significant deterioration of air quality.  
B.  Nonattainment Deficiencies 
1.  Texas rules limit enforcement of the 1-hour ozone standard in violation of South 
Coast Air Quality Management District v. EPA. 
 
The D.C. Circuit in South Coast v. EPA vacated EPA rules revoking the applicability of 
requirements under the 1-hour ozone standard.  South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., et 
al., v. EPA, 472 F.3d 882 (D.C. Cir. 2006), reh’g denied 489 F.3d 1245 (2007).  As a result of 
the Court’s decision, states were required to immediately comply with the formerly-revoked, 1-
hour ozone requirements, including Nonattainment NSR applicability thresholds and emission 
offset requirements.  
Texas’ rules include two provisions that require EPA to conduct rulemaking codifying 
the South Coast decision before TCEQ will begin enforcing the one-hour standard classification 
for NAAQS in the nonattainment areas of Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Dallas-Fort Worth, and 
Beaumont-Port Arthur.  30 TAC §§ 116.12(18), Table I, and 116.150(d).  These rules are 
inconsistent and less stringent than Clean Air Act requirements and should be disapproved.  

12 
 
Further, EPA needs to ensure that Texas is currently implementing the 1-hour ozone 
requirements consistent with South Coast, and that all permits issued since that decision are 
consistent with its requirements. 
2.  TCEQ’s rules fail to require all NSR applicability determinations to be based on the 
applicable attainment status of an area on the date of permit issuance. 
 
The Clean Air Act mandates that SIPs require Nonattainment NSR permits for the 
“construction and operation of new or modified stationary sources anywhere in the 
nonattainment area.”  42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(5). See also, 40 CFR § 51.165(a)(2)(i).   Longstanding 
EPA Guidance states that, in an applicability determination for a Major NSR permit, “the area 
designation in effect on the date of permit issuance by the reviewing agency determines which 
regulations apply to that permit.”17  More recent EPA correspondence confirms this 
interpretation.18  
 
Texas’ rules authorize certain sources that construct or modify in a nonattainment area to 
comply with PSD requirements, rather than Nonattainment NSR requirements, as long as the 
facility’s application is administratively complete prior to the area’s designation as 
nonattainment.  30 TAC § 116.150(a).  While the rules are vague as to the date that constitutes 
the “effective date of this section,” it is clear that section 116.150(a)(2) is not approvable because 
it authorizes facilities to base their applicability determination on an area’s attainment status as 
of the date their applications are administratively complete.  EPA should, therefore, finalize its 
disapproval of section 116.150(a)(2).  In addition, EPA should require amendment of any Texas

permits that were issued in nonattainment areas, but failed to comply with Nonattainment NSR 
requirements. 
B. The Texas PAL requirements are inconsistent with and less  
stringent than federal PAL standards. 
 
 
Texas’ PAL provisions are inconsistent with and less stringent than federal PAL 
requirements and should be disapproved.  In its October 2005 letter regarding the Texas draft 
PAL rules, EPA submitted extensive comments outlining deficiencies with the rules.  See 
Attachment 1.  We hereby incorporate by reference the deficiencies outlined by EPA in those 
comments and summarize some of those significant deficiencies below. 
1.  Texas illegally allows PALs for new sources based on allowable emissions. 
Federal regulations allow an agency to approve a PAL for “any existing major stationary 
source.” 40 CFR §51.165(f)(1)(i).   PALs are intended to serve as thresholds for determining 
when emission increases trigger Nonattainment NSR or PSD permitting review.  As the DC 
Circuit found in New York v. EPA, “Congress clearly intended to apply NSR to changes that 
increase actual emissions.”  New York v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3, 38-40 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Because new 
sources do not have past actual emissions, they cannot be subject to a PAL. 67 Fed.Reg. 80186, 
80285 (December 31, 2002). 
TCEQ’s PAL rules, however, do not limit their applicability to existing major sources.  
For example, two pending draft permits for new proposed power plants – the Las Brisas Energy 
Center in Corpus Christi, and the White Stallion Energy Center near Bay City – contain PALs 
based on allowable limits (instead of actual) for these currently nonexistent sources.  
2.  The Texas PAL rules fail to include adequate reopening provisions.  

14 
 
Federal rules allow the regulating authority to re-open a PAL permit in order to correct 
errors in calculating the PAL or reduce the PAL limits based on new federal requirements, state 
requirements, or changing NAAQS levels based on a change in attainment status. 40 CFR 
§51.165(f)(8). The Texas PAL rules do not provide such reopening authority and are, therefore, 
less stringent than the federal regulations.  
3.  Texas illegally allows partial PALs. 
To determine where a net emission increase has been proposed for a facility, all emission 
increases and decreases at the facility during the contemporaneous permit must be considered.  
Federal rules, therefore, require that all units at a source be subject to the PAL cap.  40 CFR 
§52.21(aa)(6)(i)-(ii).  Texas’ PAL rules do not require PALS to include all units at the source 
that emit the PAL pollutant. 30 TAC §116.182(1).  As EPA stated in the federal register 
proposal, inclusion of all units at the source that emit the PAL pollutant is an “essential feature” 
of the federal PAL.  Texas failure to require the inclusion of all units, justifies disapproval of the 
Texas PAL rules. 
4.  Texas fails to prohibit the use of PALS in Ozone Extreme Nonattainment Areas. 
Federal rules prohibit the use of PALs in areas designated extreme nonattainment for 
ozone. 40 CFR §51.165(f)(1)(ii). Texas’ PAL rules include no such prohibition and are, 
therefore, less stringent than the federal regulations, and not protective of air quality. 
5.  Texas’ PAL rules lack adequate public participation.  
 Texas’ PAL rules do not require that PALs be established, renewed, or increased 
through a procedure that is consistent with 40 CFR §§ 51.160 and 51.161.  In particular, the 
PAL rules are missing the requirement that the reviewing authority provide the public with 
notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a 30-day period for submittal of 

15 
 
public comment on the draft permit, consistent with the federal PAL rules at 40 CFR §§ 
51.165(f)(5) and (11) and 51.166(w)(5) and (11).  Similarly, the rules do not include provisions 
for public participation for PAL renewals or emission increases.  Additionally, there is no 
requirement that the state address all material comments before taking final action on the 
permit. Id. This is inconsistent with 40 CFR §§ 51.165(f)(5) and 51.166(w)(5). These 
deficiencies create public participation rules that are less stringent than the federal rules and 
require disapproval.  
 
Due to the above deficiencies, Texas PAL rules should be disapproved.  EPA has clearly 
specified the requirements for PALS in its rules, and Texas rules fail to meet – and are less 
stringent than – those requirements.   
D.  Texas’ NSR definitions 
1.  Texas use of the term “facility” makes its rules unacceptably vague. 
 
Texas’ current definitions and use of the term “facility” are inconsistent and make 
interpretation of the Texas rules difficult. To begin, there are two definitions of facility in Texas’ 
rules, and it is not clear which definition applies to various portions of the rules.  
 
Texas’ general rules define “facility” as “a discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, 
equipment, or enclosure that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.”19  The general definitions do not define “stationary 
source.”  Texas Nonattainment NSR rules define “stationary source” as “any building, structure, 
facility, or installation that emits or may emit any air pollutant subject to regulation under 42 
United States Code, §§7401 et seq.”20    The Nonattainment NSR definitions define “building, 
                                                             
19 30 TAC §116.10(6). The Texas rules do not define “existing facility.” 
20 30 TAC §116.12(35). 

16 
 
structure, facility or installation” as “all of the pollutant-emitting activities that belong to the 
same industrial grouping, are located in one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are 
under the control of the same person.”21  Pursuant to this reading of the definitions, the 
definitions of “facility” in 116.10 and 116.12 are actually quite similar to each other and to the 
federal definition.  This reading assumes, of course, that you can rely on definitions in the 
Nonattainment NSR rules to interpret provisions of the general definitions.   
 
If on the other hand, it is not acceptable to use the Nonattainment NSR definition of 
“stationary source” in interpreting the definition of facility in the general definitions, then one 
must resort to the definition of “source” in the general definitions.  “Source” is defined as “a 
point of origin of air contaminants, whether privately or publicly owned or operated.”  Pursuant 
to this reading, a facility is actually more like a federal “emissions unit.”22 The circular nature of 
these definitions, and the existence of two different definitions of “facility” without any clear 
description of their applicability, makes Texas’ rules, including the Qualified Facility rules 
vague.23  EPA should require Texas to clarify its definition of “facility” and to ensure that its use 
of the term throughout the rules is consistent with that definition.   
In its Federal Register proposal, EPA suggests that Texas substitution of the term 
“facility” for the term “emission unit” for purposes of PSD limits the definition of facility to an 
emission unit. To the contrary, it would appear that by replacing “emissions unit” with “facility,” 
TCEQ is actually creating a less stringent limitation in the incorporated federal rules. This 
provision does not equate “facility” with “emissions unit,” but rather strikes “emissions unit” 
                                                             
21 30 TAC §116.12(6).  This definition is virtually identical to the Nonattainment NSR rules’ definition of “facility.”  
22 40 CFR §51.165(a)(1)(vii). (“Emissions unit means any part of a stationary source that emits or would have the 
potential to emit any regulated NSR pollutant ….”) 
23 The definition of “source” should likewise be clarified in the Texas rules.  It is extremely confusing for “source” 
to mean an emissions point, while “stationary source” means all emissions point at an industrial site. 

17 
 
from an incorporated text so that a broader term as defined in the Texas and federal rules can be 
used instead. We believe that this provision, rather than being a more stringent limitation to be 
copied by Texas in its NNSR rules, should be struck from the rules as less stringent than the 
federal rules.  
2.  Texas definition of “Baseline Actual Emissions” is less stringent than the federal 
definition. 
 
 
The federal regulations define “baseline actual emissions” as “the average rate, in tons 
per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month 
period.” 40 CFR § 51.165(a)(1)(xxxv)(A) and (B).  The federal rules go on to states that the 
average rate “shall include emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and maintenance.” 40 
CFR § 51.165(a)(1)(xxxv)(A)(1). 
 
Texas’ rules define “baseline actual emissions” as “the rate, in tons per year, at which the 
unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24 month period.” 30 TAC § 
116.12(3)(A).  The Texas rules do not require that baseline actual emissions include emissions 
associated with startups, shutdowns, and maintenance (SSM).  Instead, the rules state that SSM 
events “may be included to the extent that they have been authorized, or are being authorized.”  
30 TAC § 116.12(3)(E).  Texas’ failure to incorporate the federal definition and the express 
failure to require incorporation of maintenance, startup and shutdown emissions in the average 
rate justifies denial of the Texas definition as inconsistent with the federal regulations. 
 
Texas’ failure to include startup, shutdown and maintenance emissions in the definition 
of “baseline actual emissions” is related to a larger problem with the Texas program.  Texas is 
allowing sources to authorize their startup, shutdown and maintenance emissions separately from 
their routine emissions.  For example, Texas allows sources that have an individual major NSR 

18 
 
or PSD permit to authorize their MSS emissions through a stand alone permit-by-rule. 30 TAC § 
106.263.  This allows sources to avoid considering their MSS emissions in determining their 
potential to emit, as well as in determining the magnitude of any emission increases.  EPA has 
repeatedly informed Texas that that its approach for permitting MSS violates the Clean Air 
Act.24  EPA should take action to assure that Texas follows the Clean Air Act when permitting 
MSS. 
3. The Texas definition of  “Projected Actual Emissions” is less stringent than the federal 
definition. 
 
 
The federal regulations define “projected actual emissions” to include maintenance 
startup and shutdown emissions.  40 CFR §§ 51.165(a)(1)(xxviii)(b) and 51.166(b)(40)(ii)(b). 
Texas’ definition of “projected actual emissions” fails to require inclusion of maintenance startup 
and shutdown emissions.  30 TAC §116.12(29).  Even where a source chooses to include 
maintenance, startup and shutdown emissions in its baseline actual emissions, there is no 
provision requiring inclusion in projected actual emissions.  Facilities in Texas often have 
extremely large MSS emissions. See, Attachment 8 (Facility emission event information). 
Pursuant to Texas’ definitions, a source that would trigger a major modification under federal 
rules could avoid a major modification by failing to include MSS emissions in their projected 
actual emissions.  Certainly if a company includes MSS in its baseline emissions, it should be 
required to include a realistic estimate of such emissions in its projected actuals.  Otherwise, 
facilities will be allowed to illegally avoid federal NSR by including such emissions in their 
baseline without including then in future projections. 
 
 
4.  Texas fails to include required monitoring definitions for PALs. 
                                                             
24 See “Letter to Richard Hyde, TCEQ, Director Air Permits Division” from Jeff Robinson, EPA, Region 6, Chief 
Air Permits Section (May 21, 2008)(Attachment 7). 

19 
 
Federal regulations define “continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS),” 
“continuous emissions rate monitoring system (CERMS),” “continuous parameter monitoring 
system (CPMS),” and “predictive emissions monitoring system (PEMS).” 40 CFR §§ 
50.165(a)(1)(xxxi), (xxxiv), (xxxiii), and (xxxii). The Texas rules omit these definitions.  
Because these definitions are crucial for enforcing and monitoring PALs, they make the section 
less stringent than the federal standard and should therefore be disapproved. 
 
E.  PCP Standard Permit 
The Texas PCP Standard Permit does not meet federal Nonattainment NSR and PSD 
requirements.  New York v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Furthermore, the PCP program 
does not meet federal minimum standards for minor source authorizations.  Therefore, we 
support EPA’s disapproval of the state’s PCP standard permit program. 
  
The Clean Air Act requires SIPs to include a program for “regulation of the modification 
and construction of any stationary source.”  42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(2)(c).  The program must 
prohibit any source or emissions activity from emitting pollution in amounts that contribute 
significantly to nonattainment or maintenance of the NAAQS or interfere with measures 
included in the State Implementation Plan.  42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(2)(D).   
 
EPA’s implementing regulations require state SIP to set forth “legally enforceable” 
procedures that enable the state to determine whether construction or modification of minor 
sources will result in a violation of the state control strategy or interference with attainment or 
maintenance of the NAAQS.  40 CFR § 51.160(a).  Such procedures must include a means of 
preventing construction or modification of a source that will cause a violation of the control 
strategy or interfere with attainment or maintenance of the NAAQs.  40 CFR § 51.160(b).  In 

20 
 
addition, minor NSR permits must be subject to a 30-day public comment period, during which 
the agency’s analysis of the effect of the construction or modification on air quality must be 
available.  40 CFR § 51.161(a) and (b).  
 
Standard permits are a streamlined permitting mechanism that EPA has allowed as part of 
state minor NSR permitting programs.  To be approvable, however, standard permits must: (1) 
be applicable only to a narrowly defined source category, (2) include specific emission limits, 
and (3) include compliance timeframes and compliance methods.25  Standard permits cannot be 
used to make site-specific determinations.26  Because public notice and comment is provided at 
the time a standard permit is issued, and not when a facility seeks coverage, all detailed 
permitting requirements as well as the analysis of impacts must be available at the time the 
standard permit is issued.  40 CFR § 51.161(a) & (b).  To the extent a standard permit is not 
sufficiently narrowly tailored to specify emission limits and compliance requirements, it is 
insufficient to assure protection of the NAAQS and fails to meet minimum public participation 
requirements. 
Texas’ PCP Standard Permit is not limited to a particular source-category and can apply 
to various pollution control projects at any source-type.  30 TAC § 116.617(a). Further, the 
permit itself does not include emission limits or monitoring.  Instead, a facility is permitting to 
include site-specific limits and monitoring requirements in its application for coverage pursuant 
to the PCP standard permit.  30 TAC § 116.617(d)(2).  The PCP includes a generic statement that 
that permit must not be used to authorize changes for which the Executive Director at TCEQ 
                                                             
25 “Memorandum Re: Guidance on Enforceability Requirements for Limiting Potential to Emit Through SIP and 
Section 112 Rules and General Permits” from Kathie A. Stein, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, 
January 25, 1995.  (Attachment 9).  Letter to Richard Hyde, TCEQ, Director Air Permits, from Jeff Robinson, EPA, 
Chief, Air Permits Section (May 21, 2008).  (Attachment 7). 
26 Id. 

21 
 
determines whether “there are health effects concerns or the potential to exceed a national 
ambient air quality standard criteria pollutant or contaminant that results from an increase in 
emissions of any air contaminant until those concerns are addressed by the registrant.”  30 TAC 
§ 116.617(a)(3)(B).  This provision itself, without specific emission limits and monitoring 
requirements in the PCP, is inadequate to protect the NAAQS, and is, in fact, an 
acknowledgement that the provisions on the face of the PCP permit are not sufficient to assure 
protection of the NAAQS and PSD increment.  
For these reasons, we believe EPA should take action disapproving the Texas PCP 
standard permit.  EPA also should require facilities that have authorized their emissions through 
the PCP standard permit to seek a federally valid authorization. 
In addition, we ask that EPA take action to halt Texas’ use of permits-by-rule that, like 
the PCP standard permit, fail to meet minimum standards for minor source permitting and for 
general permits and exclusionary rules.  Texas has adopted and is applying a number of permits-
by-rule that are not source specific, do not include specific emission limitations or monitoring, 
and are inadequate to protect the NAAQS.  These include the permits-by-rule in Subchapter K of 
Chapter 106 of the Texas rules.  30 TAC Chapter 106, Subchapter K.  In addition, like the PCP, 
some of these permits – rather than authorizing specific types of minor emission source 
categories – can be used to increase authorized emissions from any type of permitted facility.27  
EPA has repeatedly stated that Texas’ current use of permits-by-rule violates the Act and Texas’ 
approved SIP.28  Yet EPA has failed to take action to stop the illegal use of permits-by-rule.  
                                                             
27 For example, 30 TAC §§ 106.261, 106.262, 106.263 and 106.264. 
28 See  “Letter to Dan Eden, TCEQ, Deputy Director” from Carl Edlund, EPA Region 6, Director Multimedia 
Planning and Permitting Division (March 12, 2008)(“EPA has consistently expressed concern about PBRs that 
authorize a category of emissions, such as startup or shutdown emissions, or that modify an existing NSR 
permit.”)(Attachment 10); “Letter to Richard Hyde, TCEQ, Director, Air Permits Division” from Jeff Robinson, 

22 
 
IV. CONCLUSION   
Commenters support EPA’s proposed disapproval of TCEQ’s NSR Reform rules for the 
reasons outlined above.  We believe this disapproval should trigger a mandatory sanctions clock, 
particularly in light of Texas deletion of the federal definition of BACT from its SIP.  In 
addition, we believe EPA should issue a Clean Air Act section 179 SIP call for Texas’ failure to 
enforce the approved SIP and require Texas to implement the currently-approved SIP while the 
state works on changes to bring its program into compliance with federal standards.

r~uirement. The TCEQ has generally proposed to adopt thenonattaiiunent newsource .
review (NNSR) requirements and theprevention ofsignificant deterioration (PSD)
requirements from the Federalruleslocated in40 CPR 5L165 and51'.166. In many cases, the .
. 'TCEQhas proposed provisions thatdiffer froni theFederalrequirements. The TCEQmay
.adopt regulations-that are different from, butequivalent to, the Federalrule. In thefollowing
.:: comments, we have identified areasin which theState's proposed'regulation differs from the
.corresponding Federalrequirement. In suchcases-theState must demonstratethatsuch
provision'is at least as stringent as the revised baseFederalprogram,.See 67 FR 80241
(December :31, 2002). We cannotapproveState regulations that differfrom thecorresponding
Federal regulation ifyou do not provide an equivalency demonstration. In tileequivalency
demonstration, the State shoulddemonstratethat the revision will not interfere with attainment
oftheNationalAmbientairQuality Standards (NAAQS), Rate'of-Progress (ROP),RFPor

40 CFR 51.165(a)(l)(xxxv)(A)(1)& (B)(l) and. 51.166(b)(47)(1)(a)& (ii)(a).
the Federalregulations providethatbaselineactual emissions means therate of
emissions, in tons per year, and shallinclude emissions associated with startups,
shutdowns.'and malfunctions. The average'rate alsoincludes fugitive emissions
.to the extent quantifiable.
The Federalrule then requiresthat averagerate to
be adjusted downward to excludenon-compliant emissions that occurredwhile

normaloperation, but also duringperiods of startup. shutdown, maintenance

Comments on ~ecti~m 116.182 - Plant~wide Applicability Limit Permit Application.
1.
.Section 116.182(2) differs from 40 CFR51.165(f)(3)(ii) and 5L166(~)(3)(ii) because it,does
not include provisions whichrequire that baseline emissions includeemissions associated with
startup, shutdown and""malfunction. For purposes of determining' emissionsfroman emissions
unit, a unit isconsidered operationalnot onlyduring periodsof normal operation,but also
'..during periods ofstartup, shutdown, maintenance, andmalfunction even'ifcompliance with a
non-Pl!L emission limitation is excusedduring theselatterperiods. The deflnition pf baseline
, actual emissionsinsection 116.12 states that, until MarchI, 2016, emissionspreviously
demonstrated as emissions 'events or historically exempted under Chapter 10I maybe included
to the extenttheyhave'been authorized, or are being authorized, in a permit actionunder

We concludethat Texas' PAL ruleestablishes the PALemissionlimit,by summing baseline
actualemissions, but may require additionalemission reductions as conditions' upon issuance of .
the PALpermit. The Federal PAL rule allows the permitting authority to considerthe
.appfication of BAcrequivalent controls where thesource proposes to add new emissions units

an increase would be authorized onlyif the source wouldnot be able to maintainemissions,

CHAPTER B
BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY
I.
INTRODUCTION
Any major stationary source or major modification subject to PSD must conduct
an analysis to ensure the application of best available control
technology (BACT).
The requirement to conduct a BACT analysis and
determination is set forth in section 165(a) (4) of the Clean Air Act (Act), in
federal regulations at 40 CFR 52.21(j), in regulations setting forth the
requirements for State implementation plan approval of a State PSD program at
40 CFR 51.166(j), and in the SIP's of the various States at 40 CFR Part 52,
Subpart A - Subpart FFF.
The BACT requirement is defined as:
""an emissions limitation (including a visible emission standard) based
on the maximum degree of reduction for each pollutant subject to
regulation under the Clean Air Act which would be emitted from any
proposed major stationary source or major modification which the
Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy,
environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is
achievable for such source or modification through application of
production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques,
including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion
techniques for control of such pollutant.
In no event shall application
of best available control technology result in emissions of any
pollutant which would exceed the emissiQns allowed by any applicable
standard under 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61.
If the Administrator determines
that technological or economic limitations on the application of
measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the
imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment,
work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be
prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of
best available control technology.
Such standard shall, to the degree
possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation
of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide
for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results.""
During each BACT analysis, which is done on a case-by-case basis, the
reviewing authority evaluates the energy, environmental, economic and other
B.l

D R AFT
OCTOBER 1990
costs associated with each alternative technology, and the benefit of reduced
emissions that the technology would bring.
The reviewing authority then
specifies an emissions limitation for the source that reflects the maximum
degree of reduction achievable for each pollutant regulated under the Act.
In
no event can a technology be recommended which would not meet any applicable
standard of performance under 40 CFR Parts 60 (New Source Performance
Standards) and 61 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants).
In addition, if the reviewing authority determines that there is no
economically reasonable or technologically feasible way to accurately measure
the emissions, and hence to impose an enforceable emissions standard, it may
require the source to use design, alternative equipment, work practices or
operational standards to reduce emissions of the pollutant to the maximum
extent.
On December 1,
1987, the EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and
Radiation issued a memorandum that implemented certain program initiatives
designed to improve the effectiveness of the NSR programs within the confines
of existing regulations and state implementation plans.
Among these was the
""top-down"" method for determining best available control technology (BACT).
In brief, the top-down process provides that all available control
technologies be ranked in descending order of control effectiveness.
The PSD
applicant first examines the most stringent- -or ""top"" - -alternative.
That
alternative is established as BACT unless the applicant demonstrates, and the
permitting authority in its informed judgment agrees, that technical
considerations, or energy, environmental, or economic impacts justify a
conclusion that the most stringent technology is not ""achievable"" in that
case.
If the most stringent technology is eliminated in this fashion, then
the next most stringent alternative is considered, and so on.
B.2

D R AFT
OCTOBER 1990
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a detailed description of the
top-down method in order to assist permitting authorities and PSD applicants
in conducting BACT analyses.

BACT APPLICABILITY
The BACT requirement applies to each individual new or modified affected
emissions unit and pollutant emitting activity at which a net emissions
increase would occur.
Individual BACT determinations are performed for each
pollutant subject to a PSD review emitted from the same emission unit.
Consequently, the BACT determination must separately address, for each
regulated pollutant with a significant emissions increase at the source, air
pollution controls for each emissions unit or pollutant emitting activity
subject to review.
B.4

D R AFT
OCTOBER 1990
III.
A STEP BY STEP SUMMARY OF THE TOP-DOWN PROCESS
Table B-1 shows the five basic steps of the top-down procedure,
including some of the key elements associated with each of the individual
steps.
A brief description of each step follows.
III.A.
STEP l--IDENTIFY ALL CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES
The first step in a ""top-down"" analysis is to identify, for the
emissions unit in question (the term ""emissions unit"" should be read to mean
emissions unit, process or activity), all ""available"" control options.
Available control options are those air pollution control technologies or
techniques with a practical potential for application to the emissions unit
and the regulated pollutant under evaluation.
Air pollution control
technologies and techniques include the application of production process or
available methods, systems, and techniques,
including fuel cleaning or
treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of the affected
pollutant.
This includes technologies employed outside of the United States.
As discussed later, in some circumstances inherently lower-polluting processes
are appropriate for consideration as available control alternatives.
The
control alternatives should include not only existing controls for the source
category in question, but also (through technology transfer) controls applied
to similar source categories and gas streams, and innovative control
technologies.
Technologies required under lowest achievable emission rate
(LAER) determinations are available for BACT purposes and must also be
included as control alternatives and usually represent the top alternative.
In the course of the BACT analysis, one or more of the options may be
eliminated from consideration because they are demonstrated to be technically
infeasible or have unacceptable energy, economic, and environmental impacts on
a case-by-case (or site-specific) basis.
However, at the outset, applicants

- KEY STEPS IN THE ""TOP-DOWN"" BACT PROCESS
STEP 1:
IDENTIFY ALL CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES.
LIST is comprehensive (LAER included).
STEP 2:
ELIMINATE TECHNICALLY INFEASIBLE OPTIONS.
A demonstration of technical infeasibility should be clearly
documented and should show, based on physical, chemical, and
engineering principles, that technical difficulties would preclude
the successful use of the control option on the emissions unit
under review.
STEP 3:
RANK REMAINING CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES BY CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS.
Should include:
control effectiveness (percent pollutant removed);
expected emission rate (tons per year);
expected emission reduction (tons per year);
energy impacts (BTU, kWh);
environmental impacts (other media and the emissions of toxic and
hazardous air emissions); and
economic impacts (total cost effectiveness,
incremental cost
effectiveness).
STEP 4:
EVALUATE MOST EFFECTIVE CONTROLS AND DOCUMENT RESULTS.
Case-by-case consideration of energy, environmental, and economic
impacts.
If top option is not selected as BACT. evaluate next most
effective control option.
STEP 5: SELECT BACT
Most effective option not rejected is BACT.
B.6

D R AFT
OCTOBER 1990
should initially identify all control options with potential application to
the emissions unit under review.
III.B.
STEP 2- -ELIMINATE TECHNICALLY INFEASIBLE OPTIONS
In the second step, the technical feasibility of the control options
identified in step one is evaluated with respect to the source-specific (or
emissions unit-specific) factors.
A demonstration of technical infeasibility
should be clearly documented and should show, based on physical, chemical, and
engineering principles, that technical difficulties would preclude the
successful use of the control option on the emissions unit under review.
Technically infeasible control options are then eliminated from further
consideration in the BACT analysis.
For example, in cases where the level of control in a permit is not
expected to be achieved in practice (e.g., a source has received a permit but
the project was cancelled, or every operating source at that permitted level
has been physically unable to achieve compliance with the limit), and
supporting documentation showing why such limits are not technically feasible
is provided, the level of control (but not necessarily the technology) may be
eliminated from further consideration.
However, a permit requiring the
application of a certain technology or emission limit to be achieved for such
technology usually is sufficient justification to assume the technical
feasibility of that technology or emission limit.
III.C.
STEP 3--RANK REMAINING CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES BY CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS
In step 3, all remaining control alternatives not eliminated in step 2
are ranked and then listed in order of over all control effectiveness for the
pollutant under review, with the most effective control alternative at the
top.
A list should be prepared for each pollutant and for each emissions unit
(or grouping of similar units) subject to a BACT analysis.
The list should
present the array of control technology alternatives and should include the
following types of information:
B.7

DRAFT
OCTOBER 1990
control efficiencies (percent pollutant removed);
expected emission rate (tons per year, pounds per hour);
expected emissions reduction (tons per year);
economic impacts (cost effectiveness);
environmental impacts (includes any significant or unusual other
media impacts (e.g., water or solid waste), and, at a
minimum, the
impact of each control alternative on emissions of toxic or hazardous
air contaminants) ;
energy impacts.
However, an applicant proposing the top control alternative need not
provide cost and other detailed information in regard to other control
options.
In such cases the applicant should document that the control option
chosen is,
indeed, the top, and review for collateral environmental impacts.
III.D.
STEP 4--EVALUATE MOST EFFECTIVE CONTROLS AND DOCUMENT RESULTS
After the identification of available and technically feasible control
technology options, the energy, environmental, and economic impacts are
considered to arrive at the final level of control.
At this point the
analysis presents the associated impacts of the control option in the listing.
For each option the applicant is responsible for presenting an objective
evaluation of each impact.
Both beneficial and adverse impacts should be
discussed and, where possible, quantified.
In general, the BACT analysis
should focus on the direct impact of the control alternative.
If the applicant accepts the top alternative in the listing as BACT, the
applicant proceeds to consider whether impacts of unregulated air pollutants
or impacts in other media would justify selection of an alternative control
option.
If there are no outstanding issues regarding collateral environmental
impacts, the analysis is ended and the results proposed as BACT.
In the event
that the top candidate is shown to be inappropriate, due to energy,
environmental, or economic impacts, the rationale for this finding should be
B.8

D R AFT
OCTOBER 1990
documented for the public record.
Then the next most stringent alternative in
the listing becomes the new control candidate and is similarly evaluated.
This process continues until the technology under consideration cannot be
eliminated by any source-specific environmental, energy, or economic impacts
which demonstrate that alternative to be inappropriate as BACT.
III.E.
STEP 5--SELECT BACT
The most effective control option not eliminated in step 4 is proposed
as BACT for the pollutant and emission unit under review.

Introduction
Purpose
This document provides instruction and guidance for preparing and evaluating best available control technology
(BACT) proposals submitted in a New Source Review (NSR) air permit application to the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Written primarily for permit reviewers, this document establishes the
process for determining the scope of the BACT review and defines the process by which the reviewer
determines acceptability ofa BACT proposal. For the permit applicant, this document describes the approach
to a BACT evaluation and discusses technical issues that must be addressed as.part ofa BACT analysis. The
.-
evaluation process is illustrated, explained, and applied to specific situations by way ofexamples. This .
document, in conjunction with Tier III BACTand Cost Analysis Guidance Document, replaces the previous
BACT guidance document.
Content
Following the Introduction Section, the Policy and Regulatory Basis for Bact Section of this document provides
the policy and regulatory basis for the BACT analysis application requirement and presents an overview ofhow
the permit reviewer makes a final determination ofBACT acceptability. The Bact Evaluation Section of this
document defines the approach to a BACT evaluation and provides a diagram showing a step-by-step
progression through the evaluation. This section discusses each step ofthe evaluation, as illustrated by the
diagram, and addresses the principles that are vital to a BACT proposal, including emission reduction options
and elements ofperformance for those options. The conclusion of this document concludes and provides
references for obtaining additional information about BACT policies, guidelines, and other technical guidance
documents. Finally, appendix contain a summary of the minimum required content ofa BACT analysis, a
discussion ofadd-on abatement equipment considerations, and a list offrequently asked questions and answers
about the BACT evaluation.
Disclaimer: This document is not intendedto prescribe specific emission reduction strategies as BACTfor
specific processes. References to abatement equipment technologies, emission reduction efficiencies, or
resulting emission levels are not meant to represent minimum or maximum accepted levels ofBACT.
Controls beyondBACTmay be required to comply with all rules and regulations ofthe TNRCC andwith the
intent ofthe Texas Clean Air Act toprotectpublic health andwelfare.

Policy And Regulatory Basis For Bact
The TNRCC's mission and Title 30 Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 116 (30 TAC Chapter 116), are the
policy and regnlatory basis for BACT. The agency mission is as follows:
-
""The TNRCC strives to protect our state's precious human and natural resources consistent with
sustainable economic development. Our goal is clean air, clean water, and safe management ofwaste
with an emphasis on pollution prevention. We are committed to providing efficient, prompt and
courteous service to the people ofTexas, ever mindful that our decisions must be based on common
sense, good science, and fiscal responsibility.""
.-
Consistent with our mission, 30 TAC Section 116.111 establishes that to be granted a permit or a permit
amendment to ""construct"" or ""modify"" a facility, an applicant must demonstrate that the facility will ""utilize
best available control technology, with consideration given to the technical practicability and economic
reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions from the facility"" [30 TAC Section 116.111(2)(C)].
The TNRCC does not specify control technologies or emission limits in 30 TAC Chapter 116 because the
extensive diversity offacility types and emission reduction options makes specification an impractical task.
Instead, to demonstrate that a facility will use BACT, a applicants present an analysis in support of their BACT
proposal. The permit reviewer evaluates the analysis and makes a case-by-case determination ofwhether the
facility satisfies 30 TAC Chapter 116 BACT requirements. Engineering principles and agency experience,
concerning the practicality and reasonableness ofan emission rednction option, are used in this determination.
Bact Evaluation
Approach
Title 30 TAC Chapter 116 defines BACT as ""... best available control technology with consideration given to
the technical practicability and the economic reasonableness ofreducing or eliminating emissions from the
facility.""
To determine ""technical practicability and economic reasonableness"" ofa BACT proposal, the process involves
resolving questions such as: Has the proposal been demonstrated to work based on actual operation? Can the
proposal reasonably be expected to work based on technical analysis? Is the project cost acceptable to achieve
the emission reduction or elimination?

The TNRCC BACT evaluation is conducted using a ""tiered"" analysis approach. The evaluation begins at the.
first tier and continues sequentially through subsequent tiers only if neoessary as determined by the evaluation
.. process described in this document. In each tier, BACT is evaluated on a case-by-case basis for technical
practicability and economic reasonableness. The three tiers are described in the following paragraphs.
Tier I
Emission reduction performance levels accepted as BACT in recent permit reviews for the same process and/or
industry continue to be acceptable - ifno new technicaldevelopments have been madethat indicateadditional
reductions are economically or technicallyreasonable.
.-
TierI of the BACT evaluation involves a comparison of the applicant's BACT proposal to emission reduction
performance levels accepted as BACT in recent permit reviews. In some cases, evaluation of new technical
developments may also be necessary. New technical developments may offer greater performance levels
resulting in.greater emission reductions than those accepted in recent permit reviews.
If there are no new technical developments, the evaluation ofBACT in this tier is relatively straightforward
because technical practicability and economic reasonableness are established based on historical and current
practice.
Tier II
Tier II BACT evaluation involves consideration ofcontrols that have been accepted as BACT in recent permits
for similar air emissionstreams in a different process or industry. For example, an applicant may propose to
control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in one industry using technology already in use in another
industry. A Tier II evaluation includes issues relating to stream comparison and possible differences in overall
performance of a particular emission reduction option. In addition, the Tier II evaluation considers technical
differences between the processes or industries in question. To demonstrate technical practicability, detailed
technical analysis may be required to assess the cross-applicability of emission reduction options. In Tier II,
economic reasonableness is established by historical and current practice.
Tier III
This provides a brief overview of the third tier. Detailed discussion and examples of evaluating the third tier
are provided in a separate document entitled ""Tier III BACT and Cost Analysis Guidance Document."" Tier III
BACT evaluation is a detailed technical and quantitative economic analysis of all emission reduction options
available for the process under review. Technical practicability is established through demonstrated success of

an emissionreduction optionbasedon previous use, and/orengineering evaluation ofa new technology.
Economicreasonableness is determined solelyby the cost-effectiveness ofcontrollingemissions(dollars per
ton ofpollutant reduced) and doesnot considerthe effectofemission reduction costs on corporateeconomics.
The Tier III evaluation considers all available emission reduction options. For each option,the applicant
providesa detailed technical and economic analysis that:
• identifies all emission reduction options,
• eliminates technically infeasible options,
rank remaining~mission reduction options by emissions reduced,
• performsquantitative costanalysis to determine cost-effectiveness (dollarsper ton of pollutantreduced),
and
• selectsBACTbasedon cost-effectiveness andperformance.
The Tier III evaluation is rarelynecessarybecause technical practicability and economicreasonableness have
usually been firmly established by industrypracticeas identified in thefirsttwo tiers. Ordinarily, it is in the
best interestofboth theapplicant and theagencyto avoidthe thirdtier of evaluation. The TierIII evaluation is:
highly complex andquantitative; difficult to agreeon because of numerous assumptions required for
completion; timeand resource intensive whichcausespermitdelays; andnot likelyto result insubstantially
differentcontroloptions thanotherwise indicated by the first twotiers.

Step 1: TNRCC receives a.permit or amendment application with a BACT analysis included. Title30 TAC
Chapter 116provides onedefinition of BACTthat is applicable for bothnew permitsand permitamendments.
Whilethe final applied method or technique for reducing or eliminating emissions may be differentfora new
permitversusa permitamendment, the BACTevaluation is conducted in the samemanner.
Title 30 TAC Chapter116specifies conditions forgrantinga permitor permitamendment. The applicant is
requiredto demonstrate thatthe proposedfacility.will useBACT. To make this demonstration, thePI-I Form
requires submission of a BACTanalysis. To preparean acceptable analysis, the minimum contentrequirements
.-
are provided in Appendix L of the PI-I Application Instructions. For reference, the minimumcontent
requirements are alsoincluded as Appendix A of this document.
To complete a BACTanalysis, an applicantmust address all air contaminants subject to reviewfromthe
affectedemissionunit. For eachcontaminant, an applicant must identifythe emissionreduction option(s)
proposedto satisfyBACT, describe in detail the technique used for emission reduction, discussproposed
performance oftheoption(s) chosen, and provideany supporting information as necessaryfor theproposal.
Steps 2 and 3 providedetailed instructionandguidanceforevaluation of the requiredinformation.
Step 2: Assess the proposed emission reduction options. An applicantfirst identifies the emission reduction
option(s) chosen. Any of the following individual options, or any combination ofthem,may be proposedfor
BACT:
•
•
•
•
pollutionprevention (process controls/changes, sourcereduction);
equipment specification/equipment monitoring;
add-onabatement equipment; and/or
goodengineering practice(GEP)/best management practice(BMP).

The following is a detailed discussion and examples foreachofthe emission reduction options.
Pollution Prevention. As set forthin the missionstatement, the agency's goal is clean air withan emphasis on
pollutionprevention. Pollution prevention is the most preferredoptionfor emissionreductionbecauseit can
becomean integralpart ofa facility's process. Consistent with our emphasis on ""pollution prevention""
applicants are encouragedto address pollutionprevention as an emission reduction option.

(NSG9SA·7064 v-I)

Pollution prevention is best when accomplished with process control methods or process changes that eliminate
emissions. However, process controls/changes may be proposed to simply reduce emissions or result in an
emission stream that is more amenable to control. Notably, pollution prevention may be used in conjunction
with other emission reduction options to satisfy BACT.
-
Pollution prevention includes, but is not limited to, the following:
use ofalternative materials or catalysts that have a lower potential to emit, and/or
•
emission stream recycling.
.-
The following are specific examples ofpollution prevention that applicants have proposed:
use ofpacked columns to recover and recycle air contaminants for reuse prior to discharge from an
atmospheric vent,
•
implementation ofvapor return,
air or natural gas stripping ofwastewater to remove and recycle VOCs prior to discharge to
wastewater ponds,
•
use ofwater-based coatings or less volatile cleaning solvents,
•
use of lower styrene resins in fiberglass molding operations,
•
elimination 01' reduction ofair 01' other diluents that cause a final vent stream to be too diluted to
reasonably control, and
use of low sulfur fuels.
Equipment Specificatlon/EquipmentMonitoring. An applicant may specify certain equipment that inherently
has lower emissions and/or propose equipment monitoring that, when implemented, would minimize
emissions, such as:

•
installation ofinternal floating roofs, addition ofsecondary seals on existing floating roof storage;
tanks, or storage ofcompounds in a pressure rated storage lank to eliminate emissions;
use ofrobotic spray equipment instead ofmanual applications for painting large equipment (less paint
required due to better transfer efficiencies);
implementation ofa VOC fugitive emission inspection/maintenance program to assist in early
identification ofleaking components for repair; -

•
use ofstaged combustion or other low NO, burner design to reduce NO, formation; and
•
elimination offugitive emissions by:
•
installation ofrupture disks under pressure relief valves,
• specification ofleakless pumps and valves, and
• use ofwelded flanges and other piping connections for elimination ofleak paths.
Add-oil Abatement Equipment. This option addresses different types ofadd-on abatement equipment for
emissions reduction. Examples ofadd-on equipment previously proposed by applicants include scrubbers;
oxidizers (thermal, regenerative and catalytic); flares; baghouses, cyclones, electrostatic precipitators; vapor
.-
recovery units, and carbon adsorption systems.
To approve an add-on abatement device, evaluate proposed devices based on unique stream characteristics, air
contaminants ofconcern, and characteristics of the source type. For assistance, Appendix B, entitled
""Technical Considerations for Add-on Abatement Equipment"" provides a qualitative discussion ofthese
considerations.
Add-on abatement equipment may pose other concerns, such as the generation ofadditional emissions or the
transfer ofair contaminants to water or some other medium. Consider these issues in the final approval ofan
add-on control device.
Good Engineerlng Practice (GEP) and/or Best Management Practice (BMP). In some cases, GEP and BMP
may contribute to or may be sufficient to assure BACT is applied. GEP is effective design and efficient
operation of the equipment to minimize emissions. The BMP is operating practices or procedures that minimize
emissions.
The following are specific examples ofGEP proposals:
•
•
good combustion for fuel efficiency with natural gas firing, and
placement ofvalves and piping connections such that they are reasonably accessible for leak checking.
The following are specific examples ofBMP (good housekeeping and clean operating conditions) proposals:
•
collection ofbaghouse dust in enclosed and/or covered containers,

•
immediate cleanup ofmaterial spills,
stockpiling ofmanure in well-drained areas to ensure rapid dewatering, and
•
performance ofactivities that increase odor during periods offavorable wind conditions.
Step 3: Assess the proposedBACTperformance elements. The final determination ofacceptability ofan
emission reduction proposal is based on the proposal's overall ability to reduce or eliminate emissions from the
facility. To determine overall ability, assess the following elements ofperformance for the proposed emission
reduction options:
•
capture efficiency,
emission reduction efficiency or resulting emission level,
reliability,
on-stream time, and
enforceability
Capture Efficiency. Evaluate the applicant's supporting documentation for the represented capture efficiency.
Regardless ofa control device efficiency, it cannot reduce emissions unless they are captured and processed
through it the control device. The following are examples ofvarying capture efficiencies and supporting
documentation:
•
Truck and railcar loading operations can have capture efficiencies ranging from 95% to 100%
depending on the method used for loading (such as vapor-balanced or vacuum-assisted loading), as
well asthe frequency ofemission leak testing. In this example, the applicant's supporting
documentation may be as simple as describing the method used for loading with a discussion ofhow
often the system is tested for emission leaks.
•
Solid product loading using ventilation hoods for capture can have capture efficiencies up to 95% (and
possibly greater), depending on hood design. The applicant must demonstrate, through calculations
using ventilation guidelines, that the ventilation is sufficient to direct emissions to the proposed add-
on abatement device. Refer to the American Conference ofGovernmental Industrial Hygienists'
Industrial Ventilation - A Manual ofRecommendedPractice for guidance on proper hood designs.
Ifthere are concerns about the proposed capture efficiency, require testing to demonstrate actual efficiency.

(NSG9SA-7064 v-II

Emission Reduction Efficiency 01' Resulting Emission Level. Evaluate the applicant's supporting
documentation for the represented emission reduction efficiency or resulting emission level. Emission reduction
efficiencies are expressed in terms of percentage. Depending on the industry and/or situation, resulting
emission levels are expressed in terms such as pound (Ib) pollutant/ton product, Ib pollu~<!ntIMillion British
thermal units (MMBtu), or outlet grain loading in units ofgrain per standard cubic feet (grlscf).
Ensure that the proposed emission reduction efficiency or resulting emission level is consistent with the
following:
-
•
recently approved BACT, and
a properly designed and operated system.
For example, assume that an acceptable BACT proposal for controlling a particular waste gas stream is a
minimum 98 percent. However, there may be au alternative technology that, when properly designed and
operated, can achieve 99.9 percent for the same stream. Ifthat alternative technology is proposed, it would be
expected to achieve 99.9 percent destruction efficiency instead ofonly 98 percent.
If there are concerns about the proposed emission reduction efficiency or resulting emission level, at a
minimum, require testing to demonstrate actual efficiency.
Reliability. Evaluate the BACT proposal to ensure that reliable emission reductions can be expected to be
achieved. Expect a proposal to provide the represented emissions reduction continuously throughout the entire
range of the facility's normal operating conditions. The performance ofan emission reduction option over this
entire range of conditions is dependent on key operating parameters (such as temperature, and flowrate.)
being maintained at certain levels. Evaluate operation and maintenance plans andlor parameter monitoring
procedures to ensure these key parameters are maintained at levels that provide ongoing control effectiveness.
If there is concern that the represented performance will not be achieved over the entire operating range, or if
there are a large number ofparameters that may affect performance, continuous emissions monitors or periodic
testing may be appropriate.
The following are examples ofcommon reliability problems and possible measures to ensure reliability:

The ignition system and the combustibility ofa waste gas are reliability problems associated with
flares. These problems are addressed by monitoring both the integrity of the flame and the heating
value ofthe gas to be flared to ensure proper flare operation.
Sufficient oxygen, temperature, and proper mixing are key parameters for complete combustion in an
incinerator. Proper performance testing will establish that the firebox design provides proper mixing
over the entire expected range ofoperation. Proper performance testing over the entire range of
operation will also establish the maximum carbon monoxide and minimum firebox exit temperatures
required to obtain the performance level proposed.
Ongoing continuous monitoring ofcarbon
--
monoxide and firebox exit temperature should ensure reliable combustion ofair contaminants.
The carbon in regenerative carbon adsorption systems can experience a loss ofadsorption
effectiveness over time. Installing a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) to detect
breakthrough ofthe hydrocarbon stream helps to assure reliable operation ofthe system. For
non-regenerative carbon adsorption systems, it is preferable that carbon canisters be placed in series
and tested for breakthrough between the first and second canister, allowing some assurance that the
emissions will be captured by the second canister (serving as an installed backup) if the first canister
becomes saturated. Also, frequent sampling may be proposed during peak loads to check for
breakthrough.
Oil-stream time. Evaluate the onstream time of the BACT proposal. The emission reduction proposal
approved as BACT is expected to provide the represented performance at all times during operation ofthe
production facilities. Therefore, the emission reduction proposal must be onstream 100 percent of the time, or a
backup emission reduction proposal must be reviewed and approved before the permit is issued. The applicant
must address the disposition ofemissions during downtime ofcontrol systems even ifthe proposed downtime is
low. Backup or installed spare control devices are encouraged, especially ifthe uncontrolled stream is large. A
backup control device must also meet BACT performance levels. Ifbackup control devices are not feasible,
methods to minimize downtime and corrective action plans must be proposed.
Listed below are some specific examples ofacceptable proposals for ensuring 100% onstream time ofan
emission reduction proposal at the represented performance level;
•
installation ofspare key pieces ofequipment (such as circulation pumps for scrubbers, blowers for
incinerators, or extra carbon adsorption beds);

installation of backup power suppliesforoccurrences ofpowerfailure;
installation of redundant parallelcontroldevices (suchas two parallelsulfurrecoverytrains. withtail

Please note,it may benecessaryfor permits to containspecialconditions thatlimitemissions ordescribe
alternative methods for emission reductionduringdowntime of abatement equipment. However, unlessthe
emissions from the alternative methodused for emission reduction are listedin the maximum allowable
emissionrates table,those emissions are not authorizedand the applicant is not relievedfrom responsibility to
report any upset, startup, shutdown or maintenance emissions under 30 TAC Chapter 106.6 or 101.7.

outlet of the combustion chamber necessary to achieve 98% VOC destruction, Baseline emissions of
carbon monoxide (CO), expressed as parts per million (ppm), Ibs/hr, and IbsIMMBtu, from the backup
device will also be determined.
The temperature at the exit of the combustion chamber necessary to achieve 98% destruction efficiency
must be maintained when waste gas is diverted to the backup control device. This temperature mnst be
continuously monitored and recorded while the backup unit is in operation.
Records of the waste gas flow to the backup control device must be continuously monitored and recorded
while the backUP unit is in operation.
The backup emission control device must be used during emergency conditions when the primary
emission control device(s) are not in operation and for other situations represented in the operating permit
amendment application. Use of the backup emission control device is limited to a cumulative total of
six weeks/year (1008 operating hours/year); ifuse ofthis device in waste gas service exceeds six
weeks/year, the holder of this permit must:
a) Provide notification to the TNRCC Houston Region and Austin offices.
b) Schedule a stack test to confirm that the unit continues to attain 98% VOC destruction efficiency.
The CO emissions will also be determined and compared to the initial baseline values.
c) Install a CEMs for CO and oxygen.
Enforceability. To ensure enforceability ofthe proposed BACT performance, evaluate the proposed BACT
performance demonstration method. Consistent with 30 TAC Sections 116.1I 1(a)(2)(B) and (G), the applicant
must propose a performance demonstration to ensure that the emission reduction proposal will perform as
represented on an ongoing basis. Without a method to demonstrate that the proposed facility will achieve the
performance represented in the BACT proposal, an emission reduction proposal may not be enforceable and
may not be acceptable. Include the agreed-upon performance demonstration method in a permit condition to
ensure the BACT performance levels will be achieved on an ongoing basis. Performance demonstration
methods for this purpose can include recordkeeping, testing, and/or monitoring.
In some cases, maintaining records ofkey operating parameters may be a sufficient performance demonstration
method. Recordkeeping frequency for monitoring and testing data may be continuous, daily, weekly, monthly,
TCEQ xxx- RG 383

DraftPage13of24

quarterly,annual, or bi-annual. In othercases, recordkeeping alone maynot be adequateas a performance
demonstration method; testing and/ormonitoring may be required.
Testingor monitoring maybe:
•
a directemission measurement (suchas a NO, CEMor particulate stacktest);or
•
a directmeasurement ofkey operatingparameters (suchas throughput, paint rates,fuelrates,pH, or
other parameters thatcorrelateto the emissionrate).
Factorsaffectingpei1'6nnance demonstration methodchosenand thefrequency of demonstration considered
acceptable for a specificemission reduction proposalinclude, butarenot limitedto the following:
•
compliance margin(howcloseto the BACTperformance levelan emission unit is expected to
operate);
•
numberof parameters that affect the emission rat;
•
variability, toxicity, andquantityof expectedemissions; and/or
•
reliabilityof the emission estimate.
The following paragraphs describe how each of these fourfactors mayaffectthe finaldecision on the method
and frequency of demonstration requiredto ensure BACTis beingmet.
Ifthe compliance margin is close, thenmore frequent directemission monitoring may be desired to ensure that
the BACTperformance levelis not exceeded. For example, if the chosen emissionreductionoptionis expected
to barely meetthe proposed BACTperformance and the operation is widelyvariable, thena CEMor daily
testing/sampling may be required to assurethat BACTis meton an ongoing basis.
Ifthe applicantdemonstrates a strongcorrelation betweenoperating parameters andemissionrates; thena
parametermeasurement to ensurethatemissionlimitations are met would generallybe acceptable. For cases
where emissionratesmaybe affected by severalparameters, it maybe toodifficultto establishand verifya
parameter/emission rate correlation. In those cases,a directemission measurement may be required.
Emissionunits that havehighlyvariable, toxic,and/orlarge emission rateswouldmost likelyrequire
continuous monitoring. Emissionunitswithconstantemission rates ma~require only stacksampling, provided

critical operating parameters are not expected to change.. The frequency ofstack sampling requirements may
vary depending on the expected operating characteristics ofa specific facility. Ifsignificant changes in
operating parameters that affect emissions are expected to occur over time, additional stack sampling on a
regular frequency may be appropriate.
_
Finally, the reliability ofemission rate estimates may affect the compliance demonstration required. Uncertain
emission estimates, such as those based on general emission factors or other nonroutine engineering analysis,
are likely to need to be confirmed by an initial stack test, at a minimum.
When determining the appropriate performance demonstration method and frequency for a specific facility,
consider all four factors together (compliance margin; number ofparameters; variability, toxicity, and quantity
ofemissions; and emission estimate reliability).
Step 4: Is the BACTallalysis complete? The permit application requires a BACT analysis with an emission
reduction proposal for each pollutant from each facility subject to review. As stated previously, an applicant
must include all of the following:
• identification of the emission reduction option(s) ultimately chosen,
• a detailed description of the equipment and/or method used for emissions reduction,
• a discussion ofproposed performance (as listed in Step 3) of the option(s) chosen, and
• any supporting information as necessary for the proposal.
If any of these elements are not included, the BACT analysis is incomplete, proceed to Step 5; otherwise,
proceed to Step 6.
Step 5: The application is deficient. Without a complete BACT analysis, the application is considered
""deficient."" Send a deficiency letter as soon as practicable. To assist the applicant, include a copy of
""Required Content ofa BACT Analysis"" as found in Appendix A. Upon receipt of the requested information,
return to Step I.
Step 6: Is the proposedperformance greater than or equal to that accepted as BACTill recentpermit
reviews for the same industry? Previously (in Step 3) assessed proposed BACT perfonnance elements (capture

efficiency, emission reduction efficiency or resultingemission level, reliability, on-streamtime,and
enforceability). Now to beginTier I of theevaluation, determine whether theoverallperformance proposalis
greaterthan or equivalent to that accepted as BACTin recentpermitreviews for thesame industry,
-'
With fiveperformance elements, a comparison of overallperformance is donein a qualitative andquantitative
manner. For individual elements, therewillbe situations whereone or moreof the proposedlevelsof
performance vary(higher or lower) from thosepreviously proposedand accepted as BACT. Assessthe
performance level based on the overall abilityofthe proposalto reduceor eliminate emissions fromthe facility.
The following is anexample of twodifferentproposals achieving the sameoverallperformance:
• Twocompanies propose add-onabatement devices with different captureefficiencies and different
reduction efficiencies. Company A proposes a captureefficiency of 95%witha reduction efficiencyof
99.9%. Company B proposes a capture efficiencyof 100%witha reduction efficiencyof95%.
• Whilethe proposal forCompany B offersa lowerreduction efficiency, this lowerefficiency is balanced
by agreater capture efficiency, whichultimately makestheproposal equivalent to Company A's. Even
thoughthe companies have different proposals with varyingelements, bothare equivalentand providean
overallperformance proposal closeto a 95%reductionin emissions.
Specificproposals maybe differentthanthoseaccepted as BACTin recentpermitreviews. However,
proposalsmust at leastbe equivalent overallin meetingBACTto be accepted in a currentapplication. Ifthere
are questions on whether a proposal is acceptable, surveypermithistoryforsimilarindustries, and consultAir
PermitsDivision(APD) peersand management.
Proposalswill be approved on a case-by-case basis. Ifthe company'sproposed performance is greaterthanor
equal to recentpermits, proceed to Step7; otherwise, proceedto Step 12.
Step 7: Has APD identifiedother emission reduction options with greater performance that shouldbe
evaluatedfor this plant? TheBACTforany particularindustryis not static. Instead, BACTprogresses as
technologyprogresses or asprocessdevelopments occur. Subsequent to the mostrecentpermitreviews for the
same industry, it is possible that information has becomeavailableto indicate that even betterperformance can
be achievedthanthatproposed.

Draft Page 17 of24
In such cases, discuss thesituationwithanAPDteamleaderandsectionmanagerbeforeproceeding. With
APD management approval, request that the applicant evaluate the identified emission reduction option(s) and
provide the results of that evaluation.
Generally, any emission reduction options that you request an applicant to evaluate should have been
successfully demonstrated in Texas and the United States. However, there may be cases when you request an
applicant to investigate options that are used outside ofTexas or that have not yet been successfully
demonstrated. Determination of these cases will depend on factors such as the number ofplants in Texas for
the same industry, th~ number of plants in the United States for the same industry, the quantity ofemissions, the
emission reduction options considered, and the length oftime since the last permit review.
The identified emission reduction option(s) may have been demonstrated for the same industry or different
industries with similar emission streams. To determine whether a stream is similar, consider the following:
• A stream is considered ""similar"" ifstream characteristics are similar. Stream characteristics may include:
air contaminant category (such as VOC, particulate matter [PM]; sulfur dioxide [SO,]); contaminant
concentration; stream temperature; stream flow rate; or percent moisture.
• Stream characteristics do not have to be identical, only similar.
• Only those key stream characteristics need be similar to compare the subject plant with other plants.
Stream characteristic are considered key when they directly affect the emission reduction option'S ability
to achieve the higher performance.
IfAPD does not identify other emission reduction options to be evaluated, proceed to Step 8; otherwise,
proceed to Step 9.
Step 8: The proposal satisfies BACT. IfAPD has not identified other emission reduction options to be
evaluated, accept the performance proposed by the applicant as BACT for this application. No further BACT
evaluation is required for this air contaminant from this emission point.
Step 9: The applicant must provide a technical and economic analysis for the identified option(s).
Instruct the applicant to perform a detailed technical and economic analysis ofthe identified option(s). This
request is to be made only under APD managementdirection. Use the same analysis procedures as those
described in ""Tier TIlBACT and CostAnalysis Guidance Document.""

(April200l)
Guidance-This Outdenee Document Isfor useby sources subjectto

[NSG95A-7064 v-II

Step 10: Does the analysis show that the identified option is technically practicable and economically
reasonable? To determine technical practicability and economical reasonableness for an identified option, use
the same procedures as those for Tier III BACT analysis. Please see Tier III BACT and Cost Analysis
Guidance Document for specific instruction and guidance.
If the analysis demonstrates that the identified option is technically practicable and economically reasonable,
proceed to Step 11; otherwise proceed to Step 8.
Step 11: The applicant must propose performance greater than or equal to that of the identified option.
.-
If the analysis shows the identified option is technically practicable and economically reasonable, the applicant
must propose the higher performance ofthe identified option.
,
Step 12: Does the applicant show compelling technical differences between its their process and others in the
same industry? When the proposed performance is not greater than or equal to that accepted as BACT in recent
permit reviews for the same industry, the applicant must demonstrate that its facilities cannot achieve that
performance because ofcompelling technical differences. Compelling technical differences are those that may
prevent the performance accepted as BACT in recent permit reviews from being achieved. In addition,
technical differences may include those that cause the emission reduction option to cost much more than that in
recent permit reviews for the same industry. Therefore, further analysis ~ay need to be done through
Tier II or III.
Technical differences may include variations in process, product, or physical configuration. Examples ofeach
are given below:
• Process-types of raw materials; operating temperatures, types ofcatalysts, inherent moisture content,
and/or process conditions (such as wet or dry);
• Product-final product specifications, throughput/production rates; and
• Physical configuration-space limitations for retrofit ofcquipment, collection limitations(such as inability
to enclose).
In addition to process, product, and physical configuration technical differences, a modified facility may have
even more differences to be considered. To determine whether further analysis is necessary for a modified

facility, in conjunction with the APD team leader and section manager, consider: what other similar modified
facilities have done, the existing emissions, the increased emissions, and the proposed emission reduction
method and proposed performance level.
Request that the applicant provide a detailed description ofany compelling technical differences with
supporting documentation. A compelling technical difference may:
prevent an emission reduction option from being used,
•
prevent an emission reduction option from being effective in achieving the higher performance, or
--
cause the emission reduction option to cost much more.
Evaluate the discussion ofcompelling technical differences and determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether
those differences justify acceptance of a lower performance level than that accepted in recent permits as BACT.
Ifthe applicant shows compelling technical differences between its process and others in the same industry,
proceed to Step 14; otherwise, proceed to Step 13.
Step 13: The applicant must propose performance greater than 01' equal to that accepted as BACT in
recent permits in the same Industry, In cases where there are no compelling technical differences as
described in Step 12, an applicant must retum to Step 6 and propose a performance greater than or equal to that
accepted in recent permits for the same industry.
Step 14: Are there other industries with similar streams? Since there are compelling technical differences
between this facility's process and others in the same industry, a Tier II evaluation begins and the acceptability
of the applicant's BACT proposal is determined by comparison to other industries with similar streams.
Determine whether there are other industries with similar streams and consider the following:
• A stream is considered ""similar"" ifstream characteristics are similar. Stream characteristics may include:
air contaminant category (such as VOC, PM, SO,), contaminant concentration, stream temperature, stream
flow rate, or percent moisture.
• Stream characteristics do not have to be identical, only similar.

• Only those key stream characteristics need be similar to compare the subject plant with other plants.
Stream characteristic are considered key when they directly affect the emission reduction option's ability
to achieve the higher performance.
-
If there are other industries with similar streams proceed to Step 15; otherwise, proceed to Step 19.
Step 15: Is the proposed performance greater than or equal to that of recently issued permits for any
industry with a similar stream? Examine the proposed performance to determine whether it is greater than or
equal to that ofsimilar streams in different industries. Evaluate the elements ofperformance: capture
efficiency, emission-reduction efficiency or resulting emission level, reliability, on-stream time, and
enforceability. See Step 3 for a detailed discussion of proposed performance criteria.
If the proposed performance is greater than or equal to that ofrecently issued permits for the industry with a
similar stream, proceed to Step 16; otherwise proceed to Step 17.
Step 16: The original proposal is accepted as BACT unless APD has identified another option to be
evaluated. If the proposed performance is found to be greater than or equal to that ofsimilar streams in
different industries, the BACT proposal will generally be accepted at this point and no further BACT discussion
is necessary.
Occasionally, APD may identify an additional option to be considered for a facility before the BACT analysis is
completed. If the APD Section Manager and Team Leader request or approve further analysis, request that the
applicant proceed through Steps 7-11 of the evaluation process.
Step 17: Does the applicant show compelling technical differences between Its their process and others?
When the proposed performance is not greater than or equal to that accepted as BACT for recent permit reviews
with similar streams, request that the applicant demonstrate its facilities cannot achieve that performance
because ofcompelling technical differences. Compelling technical differences are those that prevent the

• Process-types ofraw materials, operating temperatures, types ofcatalysts, inherent moisture content,
and/or process conditions (such as wet or dry);
• Product-final product specifications, throughput/production rates; and
• Physical configuration-space limitations for retrofit of equipment, collection limitations (such as inability
to enclose).
Request that the applicant provide a detailed description ofany compelling technical differences with
supporting documentation. A compelling technical difference may:
~-
•
prevents an emission reduction option from being used;
prevents an emission reduction option from being effective in achieving the higher performance; or
•
may cause the emission reduction option to cost much more.
Evaluate the discussion ofcompelling technical differences and determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether
those differences justify acceptance ofa lower performance level than that accepted in recent permits as BACT.
Ifthe applicant shows compelling technical differences, proceed to Step 19; otherwise proceed to Step 18.
Step 18: The applicant must propose performance greater than or equal to that of industries with
similar streams. When the analysis fails to demonstrate compelling technical differences, the applicant must
propose performance greater than or equal to that in industries with similar streams.
Step 19: The applicant must provide a Tier III BACT analysis. Direct the applicant to ""Tier III BACT
and Cost Analysis Guidance Document"" for specific instruction for the preparation of a Tier III Analysis.
Step 20: The applicant must propose performance greater than or equal to that fonnd to be economically
reasonable and technically practicable through the Tier III analysis.
Based on the Tier III BACT analysis, select the emission reduction option that is teclmically practicable and
economically reasonable.

CONCLUSION
It is not possible to discuss every possible BACT scenario proposal. The BACT evaluation process, however,
considers each applicant's proposal for reducing or eliminating emissions based on overallperformance ofthe
proposal. It is important to thoroughly document all BACT decisions, especially those with unique and
compelling considerations. The evaluation process considers both technical practicability and economic
reasonableness ofeach proposal. Each BACT determination is made on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind
the overall goal ofachieving a high level ofprotection of the environment, consistent with sustainable
economic development.

Technical Considerations for Add-on Abatement Equipment
There are a number ofteclmical issues to consider when selecting add-on abatement equipment. Based on those technical
considerations, one type ofabatement device may be more appropriate than another. For example, it is more appropriate.
to use an incinerator as opposed to a flare for a compound containing halogen. This is because Ilie acid gas formed by the
burning process may be removed by a scrubber which follows the incinerator, bnt a flare cannofbe eqnipped with a
scrubber to remove acid gas.
The table below provides a qualitative description of different add-on abatement equipment as they apply to varying
stream and flow characteristics. The ranking ofequipment is from excellent (A) to poor (F). Since this table only
provides quick qualitative snapshots ofvarious add-on abatement equipment and conditions, it is recommended that it
only be nsed as a general gnideline. When evaluating add-on abatement equipment, ensure all technicalaspects have been
thoroughly considered.
Most orgamc halogens do not absorb ill water (D - F). Inorganic acids absorb wellm water (A - B).

Frequently Asked Questions
Q:
Is location a factor In making a BACT determlnatlon?
A: No. A BACT evaluation, as described in the BACT guidance document, is the same for all pennils and
permit amendments, regardless ofwhcre a facility is located. However, there may be additional regulations
that may apply to existing and new facilities depending on location. An example ofthis would be the
TNRCC 30 TAC Chapter 115 requirement to use compliaut coatiugs in certain counties ofTexas.
Q:
If a perforIWlIlce level is established as Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), does it
antomatically become the ""floor"" for BACT?
A: Yes. BACT is at least as stringent as RACT and may be more stringent. RACT is the minimum required by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to meet the specificRACT provisions ofthe Federal Clean Air
Act (FCAA) and it applies to both existing and new sources ofemissions regardless ofpermitting status.
However, not everything in the TNRCC State Implementation PIau (SIP) regulations are RACT.
Some SIP
rules go beyond RACT to achieve attainment ofthe National Ambient Air Quality Standards as required by
the FCAA; however, they do not establish the floor for BACT.
Q:
Does an emission rednction option have to be actually demonstrated In practice to be considered as a
possible option in BACT analysis?
A: Not necessarily. Generally, emission reduction options considered will have already been demonstrated
through performance testing or monitoring to achieve the expected emission level. This is especially true in
Tier I and II BACT determinations. However, there may be unnsnal cases when an applicant may consider
other emission reduction options that have not yet been demonstrated in practice. Ofcourse, those emission
reduction options would have to be technically feasible based on an engineering evaluation. A case may be
considered unusual based on several factors including, but not limited to the following: the number ofplants
in the same industry, the quantity of emissions, the options being considered, and the length of time since the
last permit review.
Certainly in a Tier III BACT evaluation, which requires that all possible emission reduction options be
reviewed, a new technology that is not demonstrated in practice is even more likely to be considered,
Q:
How many companies have to be nsing an emission rednction option for it to be considered BACT?
A: There is not an established number ofcompanies that must be using a certain emission reduction option
before it is considered BACT under Tier I or Tier II. Generally, an emission reduction option would be
considered Tier I or Tier II BACT ifa representative portion ofcompanies in the same industry have
received permits to use it. To determine whether a representative portion ofcompanies is being considered,
the permit reviewer shonld look at the number ofcompanies in a certain industry using the reduction option
compared to the total number ofcompanies in that industry. A representative portion could be one company.

C-I

In addition, the reason why an emission reduction option is chosen should be evaluated. Compauies may
propose to use au emission reduction option considered more stringent than BACT sccu in receut permit
reviews for reasons other than it being the best available control technology. For example, a company may
choose a stricter option for reasous that include: staying below a prevention ofsignificant deterioration (PSD)
threshold, improving performance, or reducing health effects. Because these reasons do not demonstrate that
the emission reduction option chosen is economically reasonable, the more stringent emissionreduction option
is not considered BACT for Tier I.
Q:
What is considered a ""recent"" permit review?
A: There is no established time period that is considered ""recent."" Proposed BACT levels for the same or
similar industries as seen in present-day permitting actions should be evaluated. If there has not been a
permitting actL2,n done for a certain industry in a number ofyears, BACT may be the same as in the past
unless there has been a technical development iu the control of those emissions for the same or a similar
industry.
Q:
Is there a difference between a BACT evaluation for new permits and permit amendments?
A: No. The BACT evaluation process for both new permits and permit amendments is handled the same.
According to 30 TAC Chapter 116.111, the applicant is required to demonstrate that the proposed facility
will use BACT. The applicant must identify the emission reduction option(s) chosen, and meet the minimum
content required for a BACT proposal (see Appendix A).
Q:
With an amendment application, what faeillties arc evaluated for BACT?
A: To decide what should be evaluated for BACT, determine which facilities are new or modified. The
evaluation ofthe proposed emission reduction options should be limited to the new or modified facilities.
For example, ifan application proposes to modify or add a piece of equipment, but does not increase
throughput, generally only BACT for the proposed piece of equipment is considered. However, ifan
application proposes a change that ineludes an increase in throughput or the change affects other upstream or
downstream equipment, a BACT evaluation for all equipment affected must be ineluded.
Q:
Can delayed implementation be considered in a BACT evalnation?
A: This is done only under extenuating circumstances in the evaluation ofmodified equipment. Proposals
approved for delayed implementation are considered the exception and not the rule. Ifthere are any
questions about whether a delayed BACT proposal is appropriate, survey permit history and consult APD
peers and supervisors.
Q: Is the BACT evalnation process described in this document any different for the review of Federal
PSD permit application?
A. No, ifa BACT review is required, the BACT review for state and federal PSD permit applications is
conducted using the same process as described in this guidance doeument. However, for modifications, PSD
requires BACT review only for those pollutants that have a significant net emission increase, as discussed in
the next question.

SO"" The proposed modification wilt result in an increase in SO, emfssions only, Does the applicant
have to perform a BACT analysis for all other pollutants as well as SO,?
A. For state permitting, yes, all the air contaminants from the modified facility will be subjectto a BACT
review, regardless of emission increase or not. The state permit requirement applies toracilities not
emissions; therefore, we do notdo ""partial permitting"" foronly air containments that are neworincreased.
For PSD, only those pollutants that have a significant net emission increase are subject to PSD control
requirements and state BACT analysis satisfies which federal requirements for BACT review.

Re.: Texas Air Permitting Program and Aspen Power Draft Permit
Dear Mr. Starfield:
Texas routinely issues air permits that fail to meet federal Clean Air Act and State
Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements.
In many cases, these permits also fail to address
deficiencies identified in EPA comment letters.
While EPA's recent settlement with industry
over outstanding SIP submittals is a step forward, acting pursuant to that settlement alone will
not address the numerous implementation deficiencies in the Texas program. While EPA works
on the Texas SIP, it cannot ignore its statutory duty to ensure that each federal air permit issued
in Texas complies with the Clean Air Act.
Below are examples of recent TCEQ permitting actions that warrant EPA action. General
deficiencies with the Aspen Power, NRG Texas Power, and Las Brisas Energy Center draft
permits and permitting processes are discussed
below, while
specifics are detailed in
attachments. Most ofthe deficiencies reflect recurring TCEQ implementation problems.
TCEQ fails to conduct adequate BACT analyses:
Texas reliance on its ""Three Tier""
BACT guidance (RG-383) routinely leads to inadequate BACT analyses that fail to consider all
available control options and thwart the technology-forcing provisions of the Act.
TCEQ
routinely conducts - and allows applicants to conduct - only ""Tier I"" evaluations, which require
only a review of permit limits in recent Texas permitting decisions and the RBLC.
TCEQ's
guidance notes that a Tier I analysis may not be appropriate where there are new technological
developments, but, in practice, TCEQ assumes there are no such developments without requiring
any particular analysis or research, unless the applicant or the permitting engineer happens to be
aware ofthem.
While we recognize that EPA has not required states to adopt the top-down BACT
analysis process, EPA must hold states to minimum standards to protect the integrity of the NSR
program nationwide and to meet the technology forcing provisions of the Act. States should not
be allowed to use any BACT process that results in a BACT determination that is clearly not
based on the best pollution control technology available for the source. Administrative Law

Judges with the Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH), sitting as fact finders
for the TCEQ, have plainly expressed concerns that the State's Three Tier BACT process is not
technology-forcing. Yet SOAH judges feel obligated to allow applicants to use that process. In
the NRG Proposal for Decision, the Judges wrote:
""Although the ALJs somewhat agree that the EPA's top-down BACT approach
may be better designed to be technology-forcing, the ALJs also conclude that the
TCEQ's tiered methodology is the proper method for analyzing BACT in this
case. Although there may be legitimate concerns with whether the TCEQ's three
tier BACT methodology actually ensures the technology-forcing purposes behind
the BACT requirement, the methodology has been approved by the Commission
in prior cases. Specifically, this same methodology has been used by the TCEQ in
evaluating BACT at least since 2001, when the guidance document was issued."" 1
Aspen Power provides a glaring example of the inadequacy of TCEQ's Three Tier
process. In the Aspen contested case hearing, the TCEQ Executive Director testified that a Tier I
analysis, which looked only to the RBLC and one recent Texas permit, was adequate, despite the
fact that superior emission reduction technologies for PM, NOx, VOC and CO were permitted
and in use at similarly sized, wood-biomass stoker boilers in the Northeast that happened to not
be included in the RBLC. Information regarding the superior technologies and the plants using
them was readily available on the web, yet the TCEQ Executive Director found it acceptable that
these superior technologies were not even considered in the applicant's or the agency's BACT
analysis.
As a result, Aspen Power's draft permit includes emission limits that are plainly not
BACT. If the TCEQ finally issues the Aspen Power permit, EPA should utilize its enforcement
authority to prohibit further construction of the facility until such time as Aspen Power and the
TCEQ comply with federal BACT requirements.
Aspen Power is yet one example of TCEQ's flawed BACT process. Texas has a large
percentage of the nation's major Clean Air Act sources. EPA should not allow permits to be
issued under a BACT process that is broken. EPA should take immediate action to inform Texas
in writing that a BACT analysis must meet the minimum standards specified in EPA guidance
and Environmental Appeals Board decisions.
EPA should clarify that an adequate BACT
analysis requires a searching review of potentially applicable technologies, and may not rely
solely on a review of permitted limits. Further, to the extent a best available technology is not
selected as BACT, EPA should make clear that the applicant bears the burden of demonstrating
in its BACT analysis the technical or economic infeasibility of the top control technology for its
facility.
TCEQ allows inadequate air quality impacts analyses: TCEQ allows applicants to rely
on modeling that fails to comply with Appendix Wand under-predicts actual air quality impacts.
Problems include: (1) the failure to require the modeling of worst-case emissions, (2) routine
reliance on de minimis, or Significant Impact Level (SIL), culpability analyses to allow permits
to be issued for projects in areas with predicted ambient standard exceedences, , (3) the routine

use ofnon-representative or low quality air quality data and airport meteorological data for major
source permits for which a year of on-site air quality and meteorological data should be required,
(4) the routine discounting of low-level fugitive emissions, (5) the failure to model haul road
emissions, (6) and the failure to model for the correct averaging period.
In the Aspen Power case, TCEQ supported the applicant's modeling demonstration
despite the applicant's admission that it did not model worst-case emissions. Although Aspen's
draft permit allows operation 52 weeks per year, Aspen modeled emission for only 50 weeks per
year.
Further, Aspen's modeling did not compare five years of annual average, high NOx
emissions to the SIL. Instead, the applicant compared the average high from five years ofdata to
the SIL. Despite the fact that this five-year average was 0.994 micrograms per cubic meter and
the SIL is 1 microgram per cubic meter, TCEQ did not require applicant to conduct the proper
modeling, as required by Appendix Wand TCEQ guidance, comparing the annual average for
each of five years to the SIL.
As with BACT, some of TCEQ's modeling deficiencies are due to non-EPA approved
TCEQ practices that SOAR interprets as binding precedent. In the recent NRG Power case, the
TCEQ supported the applicant's failure to model haul road emissions based on an unspecified
promise to use ""best management practices,"" and supported the discounting of low-level fugitive
emissions by forty percent, despite prior EPA objection to such policy in other cases. The NRG
Proposal for Decision stated:
""The ALJs defer to the well-established Commission policy. The ED's practice is
supported by clear and recent Commission precedent. Moreover, there is no
compelling environmental reason for overturning the ED's policy of using a 0.6
modeling factor for fugitive emissions. It is reasonably supported by technical
merit. The ALJs are somewhat concerned by the lack of EPA approval of these
adjustments, but the EPA was made aware of the adjustments in this case and did
not file any objection to them.
The ALJs further recognize the difficulty in enforcing a permit term based upon
""best management practice"". The road haul emissions are excluded in the
modeling with the presumption that NRG will perform road watering, but no
watering schedule or other measurable performance is specified. Thus, the ALJs
are not certain of the intended management practices that will be used to ensure
that road emissions are reduced. Nevertheless, the Commission's adoption of this
policy is well-established and the ALJs have no basis for disregarding it.""
(emphasis addedr'
EPA needs to take clear action to require Texas and its permit applicants to conduct
reliable modeling consistent with EPA guidance. The modeling currently conducted in Texas is
frequently results-based, allowing applicants to tweak modeling inputs - for example by using
less than worst-case emissions, discounting certain emissions, or using averaging periods that are
not reflective ofthe air quality standard - until the applicant achieves the desired modeling result.

Such modeling does not assure that new sources or modifications will not cause or contribute to
exceedances ofthe NAAQS or PSD Increments.
TCEQ allows major sources ofHAPS to ignorefederal MACT requirements: TCEQ is
failing to implement federal MACT requirements.
In the Aspen Power case, the applicant
became subject to the case-by-case MACT after the initial PSD application was filed. TCEQ
chose not to require the applicant to submit a MACT application.
The permitting engineer
testified, ""I decided just to use their [PSD] application as - also as the case-by-case MACT
application.""
As a result, at the time of public comment, the application erroneously stated that
case-by-case MACT requirements did not apply. Additionally, the applicant was allowed to rely
on its cursory Tier I BACT analysis as a MACT analysis, and failed to identify the best
performing similar source or to conduct a beyond-the-floor analysis. Nonetheless, the TCEQ
Executive Director supports issuance ofAspen's HAP permit.
Similarly, the TCEQ Executive Director has failed to make a MACT determination by
issuing the Las Brisas Energy Center draft permit that expressly excludes MACT limits for four
large electric generating units. On January 7, 2009, the TCEQ Executive Director issued draft
permits HAP 48, PAL 41, and PSD-TX-1138 to the Las Brisas Energy Center (""Las Brisas""), a
1,200 megawatt, coke-fired power plant in Corpus Christi. The applicant chose not to submit a
HAP application, arguing that the units are not subject to a case-by-case MACT determination,
because ""pet-coke is not coal.,,3 Nonetheless, the TCEQ Executive Director issued a public
notice, stating: ""... LBEC provided a MACT-like analysis... which concludes that if case-by-
case MACT review were required, the results would be no more stringent requirements than
proposed in the BACT determination.t'"" This approach does not satisfy the federal application
requirement for case-by-case MACT determinations. Moreover, the TCEQ Executive Director's
post hoc MACT rationale affords the public no meaningful opportunity to examine, for
ourselves, the so-called ""MACT-like"" analysis, prior to draft permit issuance.
Conclusion:
The problems discussed above are not the only problems with the referenced permits, nor
are they the only systematic problems with Texas' air permits.
They do, however, provide
examples of why EPA needs to address Texas' air program deficiencies comprehensively. EPA
action on pending SIP proposals, pursuant to its recent settlement with industry, is unlikely to
resolve the numerous implementation issues with the program. Further, Texas continues to issue
permits to major new sources of air pollution, such as new power plants, under rules and policies
that fail to live up to the promises ofthe Clean Air Act.
We need EPA to increase the number of staff available for Texas permit reviews, to
enable EPA to review more permits in more detail, track those permits through the Texas
process, and take action where TCEQ issues permits that do not comply with federal
requirements. While we are aware that EPA is reluctant to intervene in individual permitting
3 Las Brisas filed a supplemental Appendix to its Application, less than a month before issuance ofthe Draft Permit,
which purports to contain a MACT analysis, concluding that the BACT limits satisfy MACT for all HAPs.

decisions in SIP-approved states, the illegalities in the Texas program and Texas' failure to
implement a SIP-approved program warrant a hands-on approach.
In particular, we ask that EPA take the following specific actions.
1. Ensure that the Aspen Power facility is not constructed (or further constructed) until
such time as it obtains valid PSD and MACT permits consistent with the federal
Clean Air Act. If the TCEQ finally approves the Aspen Power permits, we request
that EPA take action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(5).
2. Inform Texas in writing that the NRG Limestone permit cannot issue until the state
has taken action through its SIP to address the modeled existing PM PSD increment
exceedances. If Texas fails to address the increment exceedance, EPA should issue a
PM increment ""SIP call.""
3. Inform Texas in writing that case-by-case MACT requirements are applicable to the
Las Brisas petcoke-fired boilers, that a BACT analysis does not satisfy case-by-case
MACT requirements, and that Las Brisas must comply with CAA 112(g) application
and notice requirements prior to construction.
Thank you for your attention to these matters and for ongoing efforts to address Texas air
permitting program deficiencies.

ATTACHMENT 1
Summary of Aspen Power Permit Deficiencies

Background
Aspen Power is seeking state, PSD and MACT permits for a wood, biomass power plant
in Lufkin, Texas. The plant is to be located in a low-income, predominantly minority
community and within 600 yards of a daycare. Its VOC emission rate is almost ten times the
emission rate of recently permitted coal-fired power plants per unit heat input.
The Aspen Power draft permit was issued in July 2008 and includes the following limits,
which apply except during periods of start-up, not to exceed 12 hours per event or 36 hours per
year, or shutdown not to exceed 6 hours per event or 18 hours per year:
NOx - 0.15 Ib/MMBtu
PM -
0.025 Ib/MMBtu
VOC - 14.9lb/hr
CO -
0.311b/MMBtu (rolling 30-day average)
A final permit for the facility was issued in July 2008 and the applicant commenced
construction. In a motion for rehearing, protestants alleged that their hearing request
withdrawals had been fraudulently filed.
As a result, the permit issuance was overturned and
the application was referred back to the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) for a
contested case. The TCEQ commissioners instructed SOAH to expedite the permit hearing, and
instructed the TCEQ's enforcement division to enter into a compliance agreement that would
allow Aspen to continue construction despite the lack of required Clean Air Act (CAA) permits.
TCEQ did so, issuing a ""compliance agreement"" citing Aspen for violating the law by
constructing without a permit, but allowing continued construction at the facility's own risk.
EPA Region 6 took enforcement action against Aspen for construction without a permit, issuing
a stop work order on March 4, 2009.
A contested case was held on the draft permit in April 2009. The TCEQ Executive
Director supports issuance of the draft PSD/MACT permit despite the agency's and applicant's
failure to comply with federal CAA requirements.
Maximum Achievable Control Technology Deficiencies
The Executive Director and Aspen Power acknowledge that CAA 112(g) is applicable to
Aspen's facility. Aspen power, however, never submitted a case-by-case MACT application, in
violation of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.404 and 40 CFR § 63.43. At the time Aspen Power
submitted its initial PSD application, on April 23,2007, the industrial boiler MACT rule
""Subpart DDDDD"" was applicable. That rule, however, was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court
on June 8,2007. NRDC v. EPA, 489 F.3d 1250 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Aspen Power never amended
its application to include a case-by-case MACT analysis as required by the CAA. 42 U.S.C. §
7412(g)(2)(B); 40 CFR § 63.40.

Attachment 1- Summary of Aspen Power Permit Deficiencies

Aspen Power argues that its purported compliance with the vacated subpart DDDDD rule
was sufficient to satisfy MACT's case-by-case requirements. Once the Subpart DDDDD
standard was vacated, however, it no longer had any regulatory effect. As an expert in the
contested case testified, there have been technological developments since the 2003 proposal of
the Subpart DDDDD standard such that the best performing similar source is achieving greater
emission reductions than reflected in the vacated federal rule? Aspen could not simply assume
the vacated subpart DDDDD standard was equivalent to the current MACT floor, much less the
beyond-the-floor standard.
TCEQ's permitting engineer argued that he could simply treat Aspen's PSD application as
a MACT application. Such failure to require a HAP application was inconsistent with legal
requirements and with prior TCEQ precedent. See, So. Alliance for Clean Energy v. Duke
Energy Carolinas, LLC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97485 (D.C. NC, Dec. 2, 2008)(Order Denying
motion for Summary Judgment and Motion to Dismiss). See also, Application ofNRG Texas
Power LLC for State Air Quality Permit 79188 and Prevention ofSignificant Deterioration Air
Quality Permit PSD-TX-1072 (SOAH Docket No. 582-08-0861, TCEQ Docket No. 2007-1820-
AIR), Order No.9, p. 1 (abating SOAH proceedings to allow time for applicant to file
""necessary"" case-by-case MACT application).
Further, Aspen's PSD application simply does not comply with the regulatory
requirements for MACT applications. 40 CFR § 63.43(e). The resulting inadequate MACT
analysis produced emission limits that are not MACT. Flaws include the following, as briefed in
detail in the contested case proceedings.
•
The PSD application did not identify the best-controlled source, or offer any
supporting documentation to justify a MACT floor for the facility's HAP emissions.
•
The application included no analysis of possible ""beyond-the-floor"" emission
reductions or of cost and non-air quality health environmental impacts or energy
requirements.
•
Emission levels were established based solely on permitted limits included in the
RBLC and in one Texas permit. There was no examination of the levels ""achieved""
by the best performing source.
•
The HAP emission limits achieved by the best-controlled, similar sources are
significantly lower than those included in the Aspen draft permit.
•
The permit failed to include any limit for mercury.
•
The permit includes illegal exemptions for HAP emissions during startup, shutdown
and maintenance.
Best Available Control Technology Deficiencies

Attachment 1- Summary of Aspen Power Permit Deficiencies

Aspen Power's BACT analysis is inadequate and led to draft permit limits that are not
BACT. Both the applicant and TCEQ conducted only a ""Tier I"" analysis, which considered only
permitted facilities in the RBLC and one additional facility in Texas.
Their BACT analyses
failed to consider technologies used by and emission limits achieved by numerous similarly-
sized, wood-fired, stoker biomass boilers not included in the RBLC.
Aspen and TCEQ illegally
ignored achieved-in-practice and permitted emission rates for woodwaste-fired stoker units when
identifying BACT for Aspen Power.
EPA Region 6 commented on Aspen's draft permit, stating that that TCEQ's BACT
analysis: (1) failed to include a ""comparison of the proposed control units with other types of
control
technology for wood waste derived fuel boilers in recent
PSD permits issued
nationwide;"" (2) failed to include an evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility of
available control technologies; and (3) failed to explain why BACT limits for NOx, CO, and PM
were accepted that were higher than the limits for other facilities in the RACT/BACT/LAER
Clearinghouse. EPA also questioned whether the source and TCEQ considered the installation
of baghouses as part of its BACT analysis and recommended the use of PM continuous
monitoring systems.
Testimony by TCEQ's permitting engineer confirmed the inadequacy of the Aspen
BACT analysis, as well as the inadequacies of the TCEQ's policies for conducting BACT
reviews.
Q: And do you agree that if a superior control option has been demonstrated in
practice - that has been demonstrated in practice is rejected as BACT that the
BACT analysis must include detailed documentation regarding the infeasbility of
that option?
A: I do not agree with that, and I'll tell you why. We use our engineering
judgment and knowledge of other analyses and what other states are doing and
what we've done previously to make judgments. If we believe something is
economically infeasible, then we will not require somebody to reprove it if we
already believe that it is.
Q:
Mr. Hughes, as you go through your review, if you had discovered something
in your research that affected your opinion about the limits, would you have
documented that?
A: I probably would have documented it in the determination - preliminary
determination summary. We don't actually have any standards or guidelines for
what we do and don't document. ... So it's kind of - some engineers may
document more than some others.
The BACT analysis conducted in the Aspen case failed to meet any minimal standards of
adequacy. There was no searching review of industry practices and control options, and
no consideration of all potentially available control alternatives. In re: Northern
Michigan University Ripley Heating Plant, 2009 EPA App. LEXIS S, 8 (Feb. 18,2009);
PSD Appeal No. 08-02. In reo Prairie State Generating Co., 2006 EPA App. LEXIS 38
(Aug. 24, 2006); PSD Appeal No. OS-OS (""An incomplete BACT analysis, including
Attachment 1- Summary of Aspen Power Permit Deficiencies
3

failure to consider all potentially applicable control alternatives, constitutes clear error
and, therefore, is grounds for remand."")
Further, as documented in the contested case hearing record, there are similar
facilities permitted with and achieving emission rates lower than those included as BACT
in Aspen's permit.
Inadequate Air Quality Impact Analysis
TCEQ continued to support the adequacy of Aspen's modeling despite the testimony of
Aspen's expert that he did not conduct modeling as required by Appendix W. Aspen's modeling
was insufficient to demonstrate that the facility's emissions will not cause or contribute to an
exceedance of the NAAQS or increments. Flaws in Aspen's modeling include:
•
Failing to model worst-case emissions. Aspen modeled operations for only 50 weeks
per year. The permit allows operation 52 weeks per year.
•
Failing to compare the annual average for each of five years to the NOx de minimus
level or SIL for NAAQS and the increments. Instead, Aspen compared as-year
average to the de minimis level. That 5-year average was 0.994 micrograms per cubic
meter. The de minimis level is 1 microgram per cubic meter.
Conclusion
Neither Aspen Power nor TCEQ complied with federal requirements for adequate BACT
analysis, MACT analysis or air quality impact analyses. EPA should ensure that Aspen Power
does not continue construction until such time as it submits and allows public comment on: a
MACT case-by-case application, an adequate BACT analysis and an air quality impacts analysis
in compliance with Appendix W.

ATTACHMENT 2
Summary of NRG Texas Power LLC Draft Permit Deficiencies

Background
The application for NRG Texas Power LLC's expansion of the Limestone Power Plant is
the next in a line of permits for fossil-fired power plants recently reviewed and approved (or
pending final approval) by the TCEQ pursuant to non SIP-approved rules and guidance.
Deficiencies with the NRG permitting process include an inadequate BACT analysis, the failure
to identify the required MACT control technology, and the failure to address identified PSD
increment violations.
The BACT analysis deficiencies identified here were raised in the January 17,2008
Petition filed with the EPA Administrator on behalf of the Environmental Defense Fund and the
Sierra Club. These deficiencies will not be addressed by EPA action on Texas' pending SIP
submittals and are common to the numerous coal-fired power plant applications that have been
reviewed and recommended for approval by the TCEQ Executive Director and are in various
stages of the administrative hearings process: Application ofLas Brisas Energy Center, LLC for
State Quality Permit Nos. 85013, HAP 48, PAL 41 and PSD-TX 1138; Application of White
Stallion Energy Center LLC for State Air Quality Permit 86088, Prevention of Significant
Deterioration Air Quality Permit PSD-TX-1160, Hazardous Air Pollutant Permit HAP-28, and
Plantwide Applicability Limit PAL-48; Application ofIPA Coleto Creek LLC for State Air
Quality Permit 83778, Prevention of Significant Deterioration Air Quality Permit PSD-TX-1118
and Hazardous Air Pollutant Permit HAP-18; and Application ofTenaksa Trailblazer Partners, LLC
for TCEQ ProposedAir QualityPermitNos. 84167, PSD-TX-1123 andHAP-B.
BACT Deficiencies in the Proposed Limestone 3 Permit
TCEQ relies on its own guidance document to conduct BACT reviews, draft RG-383.
RG-383 is not specifically SIP-approved, yet the Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings
(SOAH) believes it is obligated to apply this guidance, as interpreted by TCEQ, regardless of the
resulting failure to comply with minimal BACT standards specified in EPA guidance and
Environmental Appeals Board decisions.
This guidance document fails to implement the SIP-approved definition of BACT, and
leads to BACT analyses that fail to meet any minimum standard of adequacy. The guidance
document, RG-383 does not require emission limits to be set based upon the maximum degree of
reduction considering site-specific energy, environmental, and economic impacts. Nor does it
ensure that BACT emission limits are based on the best technology that is available. Instead, it
accepts as BACT the best technology and emission limitations included in the RBLC and Texas
permits, without requiring any analysis of potential technologies not included in the RBLC or
Texas permits.
In NRG, the Administrative Law Judge found that the NOX emission limit in NRG's
draft permit was not BACT and should be tightened. It is worth providing, in its entirety, the
Executive Director's response to the AUs determination on NOx for BACT .
.. .The AUs concluded that the annual limit of 0.05 Ib/MMBtu represents BACT;
however, the AUs recommended the short-term BACT limit be adjusted from 0.07 to
Attachment 2 - Summary of NRG Texas Power LLC Draft Permit Deficiencies
1

0.061b/MMBtu. A Tier 1 BACT analysis requires comparison with other like facilities.
Mr. Linville reviewed the information regarding NOx and concluded that BACT is the
use of 10w-NOx burners and SCR to achieve 0.07 Ib/MMBtu. Mr. Linville determined
that this limit was consistent with BACT determinations from other recently permitted
PC boilers and appropriately represented BACT for LMS3. Therefore the evidence in the
record substantiates the ED's review and concurrence that 0.08 Ib/MMBtu constitutes
BACT for NOx. (Internal citations omitted). Executive Director's Exceptions to the
AUs' PFD and Order, pp. 4-5.
Despite record evidence of more stringent emission limits achieved in practice by similar
sources, TCEQ relies on its Tier I process to justify the acceptance of a less-than-BACT
emission limit. Allowing the analysis to consider only those technologies in the RBLC and
recent Texas permits is essentially non-technology forcing.
The reality is that few Tier I BACT
analyses will result in an adequate BACT determination. EPA should act to ensure that Texas
BACT analyses include consideration of the full spectrum of potentially applicable control
technologies. Without direct action clearly requiring adequate BACT analysis, the status quo of
reliance on RG-383 will continue, resulting in emission limitations that are not BACT.
NRG Permit Proceeding Showed Existing PM Increment Exceedance, Yet TCEQ
Executive Director Says the Permit Can be Issued and No Action is Required
On June 23,2009, two Administrative Law Judges, sitting in the fact-finding shoes of the
TCEQ Commissioners, issued a proposal for decision, stating:
""[Sierra Club's modeler] Ms. Sears found impacts above the 24-hour average PMJQ PSD
increment of 30 pg/m3 ."" Finding of Fact No. 130, Proposal for Decision re NRG
Limestone Unit 3, at p. 18, June 23, 2009. Available at:
http://www.soah.state.tx.us/pfdsearch/pfds/582/08/582-08-0861-pfdl.pdf
Based on this, the AUs recommend the Executive Director take steps to substantiate the
violation and to correct it through the SIP. Id., at p. 69. While Sierra Club and EIP do not agree
that the Clean Air Act allows preconstruction permits to be issued when monitoring or modeling
shows that there is no available increment, we acknowledge that applicants routinely conduct
culpability analyses in order to show that the proposed new emissions do not contribute to the
predicted violation at the exact time and place of the predicted increment violation. This
occurred in the NRG matter. Nonetheless, EPA has clearly stated that, in such situations, the
preconstruction permit may not be issued unless the State takes action to mitigate the violation
through the SIP. See, USEPA Memo, from Gerald Emison to Thomas Maslany, re Air Quality
Analysis for PSD (July 5, 1988).
The TCEQ Executive Director takes the position, contrary to clear EPA policy, that no
action need be taken to correct a predicted increment violation, when that violation is discovered
through issuance of a preconstruction permit. Amazingly, the TCEQ Executive Director argued
in a recent legal filing that: ""Therefore, the second part of the EPA guidance that the ED
undertake some action is not applicable."" Executive Director's Exceptions to the AUs' PFD and
Order, TCEQ Docket No. 2007-1820-AIR, at p. 8, July 13,2009.
Attachment 2 - Summary of NRG Texas Power LLC Draft Permit Deficiencies
2

Because the State refuses to do so, EPA should immediately initiate a PSD increment
""SIP Call,"" in order to determine whether mitigation is needed to address PM increment
violations in the area surrounding the NRG facility. Furthermore, EPA should instruct TCEQ
that EPA will be obligated to take enforcement action to bar construction of the NRG new source
until such action is taken to address the modeled PM increment violation.
MACT Deficiencies
In the NRG proceeding, a control technology has yet to be identified for the control of
mercury emissions. While the Administrative Law Judges did find this to be a deficiency, they
also state that the Commission may view this gap in the application as a problem with form over
substance.
Texas and Federal MACT regulations require the Applicant to identify, analyze and
commit to a control technology in a case-by-case MACT determination.' Texas MACT
regulations fully and unconditionally adopt the corresponding federal MACT regulations for
case-by-case MACT determinations. Therefore, the requirements for a Texas case-by-case
MACT determination are the same as those for federal case-by-case MACT determinations. The
federal MACT determination requirements are found at 40 C.F.R. § 63.43(e), entitled
""Application requirements for a case-by-case MACT determination."" In this regulation, EPA
states that:
An application for a MACT determination ... shall specify a control technology
selected by the owner or operator that, if properly operated and maintained, will meet the
MACT emission limitation... 2
Following this, § 63.43(e)(2) then lists, under thirteen subsections, the specific items of
information that must be included in the MACT application. The relevant subsections state that:
(2) ... the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:
(xi) The selected control technology to meet the recommended MACT emission
limitation, including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated
control efficiency of the control technology... 3
(xii) Supporting documentation including identification of alternative control
technologies considered by the applicant to meet the emission limitation, and analysis
of cost and non-air quality health environmental impacts or energy requirements
for the selected control technology;4
Nowhere in NRG's applications is there any detailed discussion of mercury-specific
control technologies. During the hearing, several witnesses for the Applicant reiterated that NRG

has not yet selected a mercury control, nor even decided if a mercury control is necessary. For
example, Mr. Ben Carmine testified as follows:
Q. Would I be correct in stating that you have not identified one specific mercury control
technology that you intend to install at Limestone Unit 3?
A. You would be correct.
Q. As director of environmental operations, have you selected a mercury control
technology for Unit 3 yet?
A. Mercury control technology has not been selected yet for Unit 3.5
In response to the ADs' conclusion that the application is deficient, the Executive
Director is now arguing that the NRG's application for a case-by-case MACT determination is
sufficient based on the following suite of controls: a selective catalytic reduction system, a wet
flue gas desulfurization system, state-of-the art mercury controls, and a fabric filter. The
Executive Director is attempting to equate the black box of ""state of the art mercury controls""
with as-built information that would be required in a permit application. It is incumbent upon
EPA to direct TCEQ to require a complete application that identifies the control technology for
mercury, to be subject to public participation requirements.
Conclusion
EPA should immediately inform TCEQ that it must conduct BACT analyses that conform to the
SIP-approved PSD program and submit a case-by-case MACT application identifying a selected
control technology. In addition, EPA should initiate a PSD increment ""SIP Call,"" in order to
determine whether mitigation is needed to address PM increment violations in the area
surrounding the NRG facility. Finally, EPA should instruct TCEQ that EPA will be obligated to
take enforcement action to bar construction of the NRG new source until such action is taken to
address the modeled PM increment violation.

Summary of Las Brisas Energy Center LLC Draft Permit Deficiencies
Attachment 3 - Summary of Las Brisas Energy Center LLC Draft Permit Deficiencies

Background
The Las Brisas Energy Center (""Las Brisas"") Draft Permit Nos. HAP 48', PAL 41, and
PSD-TX-I138, issued by the TCEQ's Executive Director on January 7,2009, is an example of
the
State's disregard for federal
Clean
Air Act and
State
Implementation Plan (SIP)
requirements. The Executive Director fashioned a ""MACT determination"" out of whole cloth,
implicitly agreeing that Texas BACT equals MACT. EPA should immediately take action, by
informing the TCEQ, in writing, that (1) case-by-case MACT applies to the Las Brisas main
petcoke-fired CFB units, (2) a BACT analysis does not satisfy MACT, and (3) Las Brisas and
TCEQ must comply with federal and SIP-approved state requirements to submit an application,
conduct an analysis, and make a MACT determination subject to public notice and comment
before a permit for construction may be issued by the Commission.
Las Brisas proposes to build a large, 1,200 megawatt, power plant, consisting of four
main circulating fluidized bed (""CFB"") boilers that will burn petroleum coke. Las Brisas is a
major source of HAP. See, Preliminary Determination Summary (""PDS"") at p. 19, Attachment
3A. But, Las Brisas takes the position that petroleum coke-fired electric generating units are not
subject to the federal Clean Air Act § 112 case-by-case maximum achievable control technology
(""MACT"") standards, because ""petroleum coke is neither coal nor oil."" Id., and see also, Prefiled
Direct Testimony of Shanon DiSorbo, at p.14 -15, Attachment 3B.
Las Brisas failed to submit a MACT application as required by TCEQ's own rules, and
instead provided a MACT-like analysis as an 11th-hoursupplement to their PSD application, a
month before TCEQ published issuance of the Draft Permit. The Draft Permit does not contain
any limits purporting to be MACT for the four main boilers.
In fact, the Draft Permit
specifically states that case-by-case MACT was conducted for the auxiliary boilers only.
The
TCEQ Executive Director's reasoning is that:
""[T]he regulations do not seem to require case-by-case MACT analysis for the CFBs.""
As a matter of law, the Las Brisas electric generating units, that will burn pet-coke, are
subject to the case-by-case MACT provisions of the federal Clean Air Act.
By law, any solid
jUel-fired, including any fossil jUel-fired electric generating unit for which a MACT standard has
not been promulgated, is subject to the Clean Air Act's stringent ""MACT hammer"" provisions,
requiring a case-by-case MACT analysis and a MACT determination.
Moreover, under
applicable regulatory definitions, petroleum coke is, indeed, defined as either coal or oil.
Finally, it is conceivable that the four CFB units could fire coal or other fuel in the future, despite
the current commitment and draft permit requirement to burn only petcoke.
The TCEQ may not authorize the proposed permit until (1) Las Brisas has made
application, and (2) the Executive Director has made, a case-by-case MACT determination for
mercury and many other hazardous air pollutants that would be emitted by Las Brisas. The
Executive Director may not violate the SIP, the agency's own rules, as well as applicable federal
rules, requiring that a proper application be filed, and that such application and draft permit be
1 The ""HAP 48"" permit represents the TCEQ Executive Director's MACT determination for the auxiliary boilers only.
No MACT application, determination, or MACT limits are included for the four main boilers.

made available for public notice. Anything short of compliance with these requirements not only
violates basic public notice, but also disregards the Clean Air Act's stringent MACT provisions.
Las Brisas relies on the vacated definitional change of ""coal-fired,"" as explained in the
January 30, 2004, Federal Register notice in which EPA proposes the de-listing and Clean Air
Mercury Rule, for the proposition that petroleum coke is a ""non-regulated supplementary fuel""
(69 Federal Register, page 4,674). See, PDS, p. 19.
The proposed rule defines ""coal-fired electric generating steam unit"" as follows:
Coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit means an electric utility steam generating
unit that burns coal, coal refuse, or a synthetic gas derived from coal either exclusively, in
any combination together, or in any combination with other supplemental fuels.
Examples of supplemental fuels include, but are not limited to, petroleum coke and tire-
derived fuels. 69 FR 4727 (January 30,2004)
On reconsideration of the (vacated) de-listing decision, EPA inserted a ""technical
correction"" which sought to clarify that while coal plants that burned some petcoke were covered
by the (vacated) standard, petcoke itself is not coal. See, 70 FR at 62218, column 1-2.
Relying on these Federal Register notices is erroneous for at least two reasons. First,
EPA's actions were vacated in their entirety. See, New Jersey v. EPA, No. 05-1097 at 15.
Second, notwithstanding the now-vacated de-listing and CAMR decisions, any solid fuel-fired
EGUs for which there is no promulgated MACT standards are subject to case-by-case MACT.
Additionally, the definitions of ""coal"" in 40 CFR 60 Subparts Db and De are instructive.
§ 60.41b Definitions.
* * * * *
Coal means all solid fuels classified as anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, or
lignite by the American Society of Testing and Materials in ASTM D388
(incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), coal refuse, and petroleum coke. Coal
derived synthetic fuels, including but not limited to solvent refined coal, gasified
coal not meeting the definition of natural gas, coal-oil mixtures, coke oven gas,
and coal-water mixtures, are also included in this definition for the purposes of
this subpart. 74 FR 5084 (January 28, 2009)

Even if the definition of ""coal"" does not currently include pet-coke, then the definition of
""oil"" does. In issuing its final decision on reconsideration, EPA defined ""petroleum"" to include
petcoke. See, 71 FR at 33396. Importantly, EPA changed the definition of ""petroleum"" to:
""Petroleum means crude oil or petroleum or a fuel derived from crude oil or petroleum,
including distillate, residual oil, and petroleum coke."" 40 CFR 60.41Da (adopted by final
rule 71 FR 9866)
In the proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule (""CAIR""), which was co-proposed with
CAMR), EPA proposed the following definition:
Oil-fired electric utility steam generating unit means an electric utility steam generating
unit that either burns oil exclusively, or burns oil alternately with burning fuels other than
oil at other times. See 69 FR at 4727.
Based on the foregoing discussion, it is clear that it was EPA's intent to include pet-coke
in either the definition of ""oil"" or ""coal"" as those terms are used to identify ""coal- or oil-fired
electric utility"" units. Since EPA's regulatory determination in 2000 applied to both coal- and
oil-fired units, proposed petcoke-fired units are currently subject to the MACT hammer, and
must undertake a formal case-by-case MACT analysis for all HAPs. Certainly an interpretation
of ""oil"" that excludes petcoke would be directly in conflict with the only existing indications of
EPA's own interpretation of this language. Finally, the current definition of ""fossil fuel""

material."" 40 CPR 60.41 Da.
A ""MACT-Like"" Analysis Does Not Satisfy the Legal Requirement, and BACT is
NotMACT.
The TCEQ Executive Director determined that:
""Although the regulations do not seem to require case-by-case MACT analysis for the
CFBs, Las Brisas provided a MACT like analysis in Appendix D to the permit
application, which concludes that if case-by-case MACT review were required, the
results
would be
no
more
stringent requirements
than
proposed
in the
BACT
determination."" (Emphasis added.)
Prior to providing the TCEQ with a ""MACT-like analysis,"" Las Brisas submitted the
following as part of the Application:
""10.10 HAP - 30 TAC § 116.111(a)(2)(K). The Las Brisas CFB boilers and Auxiliary
boilers are not subject to any existing MACT standards; therefore, [sic] may likely be an
affected source subject to the requirements of FCAA 112(g) or 1120). Las Brisas
recognizes that the vacatur of the Clean Air Mercury Rule, along with the absence of a

source
category MACT
standard, may
now subject the proposed
CFBs to
the
requirements for case-by-case MACT pursuant to FCAA 112(g).
In addition, LAS BRISAS also recognizes that the vacatur of the Boiler MACT (40 CFR
Part 63, Subpart DDDDD), along with the absence of a source category MACT standard,
may now subject the proposed Auxiliary Boilers to the requirements for case-by-case
MACT pursuant to FCAA 112(g) and/or the MACT Hammer provisions of FCAA 1120).
However, at this time LEBC is awaiting guidance from the Court, TCEQ, and EPA prior
to submitting an application to establish a case-by-case MACT limit for the CFBs and/or
a 112(j) determination for the Auxiliary Boilers.""
App. p. 55 (emphasis added).
The TCEQ Executive Director, in issuing the Draft Permit.takes a nuanced position on
the question of whether case-by-case MACT applies to this source, and whether or not a MACT
Determination was made:
""XII. CASE-BY-CASE
MAXIMUM ACHIEVABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY
(MACT)
A. Petroleum Coke-Fired CFBs The proposed CFBs are major sources of hazardous air
pollutants (HAP), a collection of about 189 pollutants listed by the EPA under the
Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) § 112(b). Under FCAA § 112, most major sources of
HAP are subject to MACT standards for control of HAP. However, for some electric
utility steam generating units (EUSGU), determining the applicability of regulation under
§ 112 is more complicated, based on language in FCAA § 112(n)(l) that requires EPA to
perform a study of the hazards to public health associated with HAP emissions from
EUSGU, and to require regulation of HAPS if the Administrator finds such regulation is
appropriate and necessary after considering the results of the study. Following the 1999
study, the EPA published in December, 2000, a finding under FCAA § 112(c), called a
""listing decision,"" that it was necessary and appropriate to regulate oil and coal-fired
EUSGU under FCAA § 112. EPA later de-listed oil- and coal-fired EUSGU and
developed regulations for mercury for the coal units and nickel for the oil units under
FCAA § 111. These rules were vacated in March, 2008 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the D.C. Circuit. Under this decision, the 2000 listing decision is thought to stand again.
Las Brisas takes the position that the petroleum coke-fired CFBs are not subject to FCAA
§ 112 because petroleum coke is neither coal nor oil. Las Brisas cites the January 30,
2004 proposed MACT rule for coal and oil fired EUSGUs, that refers to petroleum coke
as a non-regulated supplementary fuel (69 Federal Register, page 4,674). Usually, if EPA
fails to issue a MACT standard in a timely fashion, FCAA § 112(g) makes it necessary
for new major HAP sources to undergo case-by-case MACT review under the NSR
process. However, under the TCEQ's rule implementing FCAA § 112(g), at 30 TAC §
116.402(a), the requirements do not apply to EUSGU unless and until such time as these
units are added to the source category list under FCAA 112(c)(5). Although the
regulations do not seem to require case-by-case MACT analysis for the CFBs, Las Brisas
provided a MACT like analysis in Appendix D to the permit application, which
concludes that if case-by-case MACT review were required, the results would be no more
Attachment 3 - Summary of Las Brisas Energy Center LLC Draft Permit Deficiencies
5

stringent requirements than proposed in the BACT determination.
(Emphases added;
Preliminary Determination Summary for Permit Nos. 85013, HAP48, P ALAI, and PSD-
TX-I138, Page 19).
Yet, in its final public notice in this matter, the Notice of Application and Preliminary
Decision (""NAPD""), the ED states that maximum achievable control technology will be used for
the control of hazardous air pollutants. (NAPD p.2).
The court in New Jersey v. EPA, No. 05-1097, (D.C. Cir. Feb. 8,2008) vacated not only
EPA's CAMR rule, but also EPA's ""de-listing"" of coal- and oil-fired power plants. The now
vacated rule attempted to remove these sources from the Clean Air Act section 112(c) list of
sources for which emissions standards based on MACT are required under CAA section 112(d).
Because EPA's de-listing rule is vacated, the court itself recognized, id., slip op. at 17, that coal-
and oil-fired ""EGUs remain listed under section 112."" (Emphasis added.) As a result, the
statutory requirements that attach at listing directly apply to coal- and oil-fired electric
generating units. Even if Las Brisas were not subject to MACT as a solid fuel-fired EGU, then it
would be subject to industrial boiler MACT.
These requirements include the case-by-case MACT requirements found in 42 U.S.c. §
7412(g). See also 40 C.F.R. §63.40(c). Because EPA has not promulgated categorical MACT
standards applicable industry-wide, a case-by-case determination, pursuant to CAA Sec. 112(g)
is required.
Nowhere in the law, is there any exception or allowance for a ""MACT like""
determination. And, nowhere in the law is there any provision allowing a regulatory agency to
simply sign off on an applicant's contention that if a MACT determination were required, the
result would be no more stringent than BACT.
A ""MACT-like"" analysis is not sufficient to comply with the legal requirement. In
Southern Alliancefor Clean Energy v. Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, the Court faced an issue
similar to the one here. In that case, Plaintiffs sued a Duke Energy power plant for continuing
construction without compliance with MACT's case-by-case requirements. At the time the Duke
plant received a permit and commenced construction, EPA had adopted a rule exempting coal-
fired power plants from the list of facilities regulated under the MACT provisions. The EPA's
action in delisting power plants was subsequently challenged, reversed and vacated.
See New
Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574,583 (D.C. Cir. 2008).
The court in Southern Alliance held that the reversal must be given retroactive effect and
that, therefore, Duke was subject to MACT's requirement for a case-by-case MACT
determination prior to construction. The court rejected Duke and North Carolina's attempt to use
a ""MACT-like"" or ""MACT equivalent"" proceeding stating that Duke ""has yet to participate in a
full MACT, case-by-case procedure with full opportunity for public scrutiny.... The Court finds
no reason to substitute a suggested process for that required under existing law."" So. Alliancefor
Clean Energy v. Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97485 (D.C. NC, Dec. 2,
2008)(Order Denying motion for Summary Judgment and Motion to Dismiss).
In addition, BACT is not MACT. Setting aside the major flaws with Texas'
implementation of BACT, even the most thorough BACT analysis would still not equate to a
Attachment 3 - Summary of Las Brisas Energy Center LLC Draft Permit Deficiencies
6

MACT analysis. EPA has commented, and TCEQ is well-aware, that the State may not interpret
the federal requirement for a case-by-case MACT determination to be satisfied by a BACT
determination.
See,23 TexReg 6980, Volume 23, Number 27 (July 3,1998). EPA should not
allow Texas to continue issuing permits that blatantly disregard clear requirements.
TCEQ Rules Require A Case-by-case MACT Analysis.
TCEQ's application and hazardous air pollutant (""HAP"") rules require that LAS
BRISAS's application include a case-by-case MACT analysis.
Consistent with the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations §63.43 (concerning
maximum achievable control technology determinations for constructed and
reconstructed major sources), the owner or operator of a proposed affected source ...shall
submit a permit application as described in §116.110 of this title (relating to
Applicability). 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.404.
See also, 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.111, requiring that an application include information
which demonstrates that for hazardous air pollutants the source ""shall comply with all applicable
requirements under Subchapter C of this chapter: relating to Hazardous Air Pollutants:
Regulations Governing Constructed or Reconstructed Major Sources (FCAA, §112(g), 40 CFR
Part 63)."" 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.111(a)(2)(K).2
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, EPA should immediately inform the TCEQ Executive Director
that the (1) case-by-case MACT applies to the Las Brisas main petcoke-fired CFB units, (2) a
BACT analysis does not satisfy MACT, and (3) Las Brisas and TCEQ must comply with federal
and SIP-approved state requirements to submit an application, conduct an analysis, and make a
MACT determination subject to public notice and comment before a permit for construction may
be issued.
2 Subchapter C: ""relating to Hazardous Air Pollutants: Regulations Governing Constructed or Reconstructed Major
Sources (FCAA, §112(g), 40 CFR Part 63),"" is now found at Subchapter E, 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.400 et. seq.

PROJECT LOCATION
The Las Brisas Energy Center (LBEC) is located at 6059 Joe Fulton Corridor, Corpus
Christi, Nueces County, Texas.
III.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
LBEC proposes to construct and operate new steam-electric utility generating facilities
using four circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers, each with a design maximum heat
input of 3,080 million British thermal units per hour (MMBtu/hr) and 300 MW net
electric output. The gross electric output of the four steam electric generators is about
1,400 MW; the net electric output of the LBEC is about 1,200 MW. The proposed fuel is
petroleum coke. The project is sized with the capability to take all the petroleum coke
produced by the Corpus Christi petroleum refineries, located nearby along the Corpus
Christi Ship Channel Natural gas is proposed as the CFB startup fuel, with vaporized
propane as a back-up startup fuel if natural gas is unavailable.
Air pollutant-emitting equipment necessary for supporting the operation of the CFBs and
steam turbine generators is included in the draft air permit. Combustion-type facilities
include: two auxiliary boilers, used to provide process steam during CFB startups,
shutdowns, and during the commissioning phase of the project (the last phase of
construction); two propane vaporizers to vaporize the propane back-up fuel; and eleven
diesel engines to provide, variously, emergency electric generation, fire fighting water
pumping capability, and emergency boiler feed water pumping capability. Each auxiliary
boiler and propane vaporizer will be limited to operate no more than 2,500 hours per
year; each engine, no more than 500 hours per year.
The steam-electric generation process requires that the steam circulated in the boiler-
steam turbine loop be condensed to water before being pumped up to operating pressure
and returned to the boiler. LBEC proposes two water-cooled cooling towers, each with a
cooling water circulation design rate of 300,000 gallons per minute.

The results of the analysis indicate that the predicted worst-case concentrations for all
compounds are less than their respective I-hr and annual average ESLs, except for
vanadium & compounds. The predicted short-term maximum concentration off-property
for vanadium & compounds is 1.4 times its ESL for 3 hours per year, and is 1.2 times its
ESL for two hours per year at the highest non-industrial receptor. Based on the guidance
contained in RG-324, these impacts are considered acceptable by TCEQ's toxicologists.

pollutants be conducted, but TCEQ's air quality permits program requires an appropriate
2
level of impacts analysis regardless of whether PSD is triggered. The primary implication
3
of PSD review in Texas is that the applicant must show through the impacts analysis that
4
the so-called ""PSD increments"" are protected. Also, an analysis of a project's potential
5
effects on growth, soils, vegetation, and visibility is needed.
6
Case-by-case MACT or HAP permitting, which I also mentioned previously, is another
7
federally mandated group of preconstruction permitting requirements that may be triggered
8
under the TCEQ's Chapter 116 rules. Case-by-case MACT is triggered only for the
9
construction and reconstruction of certain ""major"" sources of HAP for which the EPA has
10
not promulgated a MACT standard under 40 C.F.R. Part 63. Significantly, TCEQ's HAP
11
permitting rules exempt from case-by-case MACT requirements electric generating units
12
that have not been added to the source category list under Section 112( c)( 5) of the federal
13
Clean Air Act.
14
Pursuant to TCEQ's case-by-case MACT rules, the construction of a group of stationary
15
sources such as the LBEC is considered to be the construction of a major source of HAP if
16
the sources will emit 10 tons per year of any individual HAP or 25 tons per year of any
17
combination of HAP. The reconstruction of an existing major source of HAP may also
18
trigger case-by-case MACT. The LBEC will be a new major source of HAP and, thus,
19
triggers case-by-case MACT review for those non-exempt sources for which the EPA has
20
not promulgated a MACT standard.
21
Although coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (""EUSGUs"") have been
22
added to the federal Clean Air Act § 112(c)(5) source category list, petroleum coke-fired
23
EUSGUs have not. Accordingly, the LBEC Units are exempt from case-by-case

MACT requirements pursuant to TCEQ's HAP permitting rules. The auxiliary boilers
2
and propane vaporizers are, however, subject to case-by-case MACT requirements due to
3
the vacatur of the EPA's MACT standards for industrial, commercial, and institutional
4
boilers and process heaters (40 C.F.R. Part 63, Subpart DDDDD).
5
Similar to PSD, the applicability of case-by-case MACT requirements does not have a
6
great effect on permit emission limitations in Texas. The reason for this is the stringency
7
of the TCEQ BACT review process. Accordingly, the purpose of the case-by-case
8
MACT review is to confirm that the BACT -based emission limits also reflect MACT for
9
each HAP or HAP category. This review is conducted in a two-step process. First, the
10
MACT ""floor"" or most stringent emission limitation achieved in practice by the best
11
controlled similar source is established. Second, a ""beyond the floor"" analysis is
12
performed to identify other methods for potentially reducing emissions to a greater
13
degree, considering factors such as the cost of achieving such emissions reductions and
14
any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, and to
15
establish whether these reductions are achievable. The case-by-case MACT limit must be
16
no less stringent than the MACT ""floor"" and, if applicable, ""beyond the floor"" limits. In
17
addition to NNSR, PSD, and HAP requirements, if applicable, an NSR permit applicant
18
must address any applicable federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
19
Pollutants (""NESHAPS"") and New Source Performance Standards (""NSPS""). These
20
requirements, codified in 40 C.F.R. Parts 61 and 63 (NESHAPS) and Part 60 (NSPS), set
21
forth technology-based emission control standards for specific types of operations and
22
specific pollutants.

A
It's happened more than once.
8
(Laughter)
9
Q
(BY MR.
LEVIN)
Thank you for that.
And
10
so -- and here is why I'ro asking about this.
Do you
11
still have your deposition handy'?
14
of your deposition.
12
13
15
16
17
That legislation is dead,
I
MR. RILEY:
MR. LEVIN:
1 1m sorry:
MR.
RILEY:
That legislation,
I believe,
No.
1
A
3
believe.
9
10
23
Q
Okay.
Now,
the last sentence of the second
~4
paragraph,.
whdcb is the large -- t.he bigger paragraph
~S
there on that page.
Do you see that last sentence
18
A
Yes.
19
Q
Okay.
And so that excerpt that I read on the
20
first page, the e-mail that went to you, that came out
21
of this e-mail.
Right?
25
500, which was his deposition on written questions,
so
18
Page 12 or is it -- or which deposition?
19
MR. LEVIN:
Oh, it's the deposition
20
of --
21
JUDGE BENNETT:
Not the deposition on
22
written questions, but the oral deposition'?
23
MR.
LEVIN:
Correct.
JUDGE BENNETT:
Okay.
We were just at
24
Yes.
A
22
1907
1909
6
Permits Division.
1
that says,
""Ri.chazd"" -- and, by the way,
who is
2
Richard?
7
Q
Okay.
And it says, ""Richard has stressed the
8
importance of getting this done at Mr. Vickery's
9
request.""
And who is Mr.
Vickery?
11
Q
Okay.
And then the second -- the next
12
paragraph starts out,
""Ef we get in a pinch on 12/30
13
Mr.
Hagle said he would be available on 12/31 by
14
e-mail from home.""
Do you see that?
(BY MR. LEVIN)
Are you there,
Randy?
Yes.
o
A
20
statement?""
And you said,
""Yes.""
Are you with me?
1
I was
a little confused.
4
Q
Okay.
Now,
I asked you in your deposition
5
about a statement that you made in your deposition on
6
written questions.
And 1 ' m actually on Page 9 at
7
Line 23 in your depo that you have in front of you.
8
And I asked you,
""Okay.
Let me ask you about a
9
statement. you make in your deposition on written
10
question responses, and you're talking specifically
11
about best available control technology, or BACT.
And
12
I'm going to come back -- and I have a few questions
13
about BACT in a little while, but you said -- in
14
describing the process for BACT, you said in some
15
cases, negotiations ate necessary to lower the
16
proposed limits to reflect BACT, and if the permit
17
engineer and the applicant do not agree on proposed
18
BACT, TCEQ management above the engineer will make the
19
decision.""
And I said,
""Do you recall that
Yes.
He is the Executive Director of the TCEQ.
That would be Richard Hyde.
Okay.
And who is Richard Hyde?
At the time he was the Director of the Air
A
A
o
A
A
3
4
16
Q
Okay.
What was 50 important about getting
17
the draft. permit out by 12/3!?
18
MS.
SELVERA:
Objection.
He's al.ready
19
answered his knowledge basis for why the permit would
20
have to come out on the date it was requested.
10
15
21
JUDGE BENNETT;
Overruled.
I III allow
21
A
I'm socrv ,
~2
that.
22
Q
Ycu t r-e lost?
23
A
I understand that Las Brisas talked to
23
A
I
remember that, but I'm lost here.
24
Mark Vickery about the importance of getting the
25
permit out., and Mark made some commitments that we
24
Q
Okay.
1 1m on page -- I started on Page 9,
25
Line 23 in your deposition that you have before you.

1
A
Okay.
I ""rn with you.
2
Q
Okay.
And r""m not going to re-read that into
3
the record.
But did I characterize that correctly
4
there?
I went over to Page 10.
I read all the way
5
through the end of my long quest.ion, which ended
6
Page 10, Line 9.
1
A
Right.
2
Q
Okay.
Now. Table A,
the third column, let me
3
ask you about tihe t .
Do you see that?
And itls a
4 little hard to read in the copies, but I see there
5
that the third column has qct; ""Compliance Averaging
6
Pe r i.od..""
A
Yes.
7
A
Yes.
9
doesn't say,
""Compliance Averaging Period,"" does it?
12
Right?
B
0
Okay.
Do you remember that I asked you about
9
your statement in your deposition on written
10
questions, that from time to time, TeBQ management
11
above the engineer will make the decision about BACT'?
12
Do you recall that '?
8
10
11
o
A
o
Okay.
Now, in Table B,
the third column, it
No.
It says.
""Compliance Demonstration Period.""
13
14
A
o
Yes.
Okay.
And I said,
""Do you recall that
13
14
A
o
Right.
Okay.
What's the difference between those
21
A
Yes.---
22
Q
Okay.
And I asked you,
""And specifically,
23
with which emission limit or control technology did
24
this happen:""
And you answered,
A'The NOX limit.""'
15
staterne!lt?""
And you said,
""Yes.""
16
The next question on
Page 10, Line 11,
I
17
asked you,
""Did that happen in this matter?""
And you
18
answered, ""I would say, in effect, it did.
I was
19
pursuing a line of inquiry and management felt that it
20
was time to move on,
I guess. n
25
A
Yes.
1911
15
two things?
16
A
It just connotes a little difference in the
17
thinking about showing compliance through
18
continuous -- what we call continuous monitoring and
19
what we would call any number of things, but stack
20
testing.
Stack testing is this different thing.
21
Q
Okay.
And the reason -- and keeping all that
22
open, if you can -- I'm going to try to make this as
23
focused as r can -- but can you turn to the
24
preliminary determination swnrnary, which is Las Brisas
25
Exhibit 21 in this matter.
I'm going to ask you to
1
flip back and forth.
And so if you need tabs or
2
something to keep your place, let me know.
3
And specifically it's Las Brisas
4
Exhibit 21,
Page 5 -- I'm sorry -- Page 4.
lind let me
1913
6
Brises boilers.
Correct'?
S
know when you're there.
6
A
1 1m there.
9
inquiry.
Correct'?
10
A
Correct.
11
Q
Okay.
Let me ask you now about -- I have
12
some general questions about BACT, and lim going to
13
ask you to turn to Las Brisas Exhibit 27.
It's the
14
draft permit.
And,
Randy, when you get there,
1 1m
15
going to ask you to turn to Las Brisas Exhibit 27,
16
Page 3, the BACT table or Special Condition 11.
17
A
Yes.
18
Q
Okay.
And I want to ask you about Special
19
Condition 11, Tables A and B.
20
Now, Table A says,
IlStandards
21
Demonstrated by Continuous EInissions Monitoring
22
Systems
(CEMS).·
Right?
23
A
Right.
24
Q
Okay.
And Table B says.
""Standards
25
demonstrated by Reference Method testing.""
Right?
A
o
Okay.
And you were told to stop that
7
Q
Okay.
So IV,
""Control Technology. Best
8
Available Control Technology,"" do you see that?
9
A
Roman VI.
10
Q
1 1 m sorry.
VI, Section A,
""CFB Boilers.""
11
Are you \oJith me?
12
A
Yes.
13
Q
Okay.
And there t s a table there that goes on
14
to the next page.
Now,
I understand that those are
15
the BACT limits, the proposed BACT limits for this
16
plant.
Right?
17
A
It's my attempt to summarize what -- itts my
18
attempt to summarize what is in the draft permit.
19
Q
Okay.
And that's my question, because for
20
the pollutants in that table -- NOX, S02 and CO --
21
it I s got an averaging time associated with all of
22
those.
Right?
23
A
(Nodded)
24
Q
And r see that those averaging times are the
25
same averaging times in Table -- in Special Condi tion

Comment 19 (photochemical Modeling): Commenter is concerned about TCEQ guidance
referenced by the applicant when assessing.the ozone impacts from the proposed unit in its PSD
permit application.
Specifically, it was determined that 'the location is ozone neutral.
If the
TCEQ guidance that was used was based on the Scheffe Point Source Screening Tables, the EPA
has commented.and provided, information to TCEQ 0U the inaccuracy ..of using Scheffe Point
Source,Screening, Tables-for determiaing, ozone::ambieIit 5mpact's in'previous. permit comment
letters. Use of the Scheffe Point Source Screening Tables or similar screening processes is not
EPA-approved. TCEQ Air Quality Modeling Guidelines establish a process by which the permit
applicant communicates with the TCEQ staff and develops-a-modeling protocol that will be
followed. Commenter did not see where a modeling protocol Was developed or-submitted by the
applicant. Commenter asks that the applicant forward a copy ofthe modeling protocol if it was
prepared (EPA).
Commentersare concerned that TCEQ relies on outdated and inaccurate modeling requirements
suchas the.Scheffe Point Source Screening Tables for determining ozone ambient.impact (NCC,
Public Citizen"" SEED Coalition).
Commenter claims that TCEQ's statement that the proposed source, considering its proposed
location, is ozone neutral is in direct conflict with control strategies developed to reduce ozone in
the nearby Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) Non-Attainment Area. Commenter states that it
will corisideravailable enforcement authorities for objecting to the subsequent Title V permit for
this facility ifan appropriate ozone analysis is not conducted for this facility (EPA).
Commenter asks that TCEQ provide appropriate air quality modeling for ozone impacts that
clearly demonstrate 1) what the project's impact will be at specific monitors in the HGB area and

2) that the construction ofthe facility will not significantly impact ozone levels in the HGB area
(EPA).
Commenter states that the only modeling technique that would be technically appropriate for this
source would be a CAMx based analysis using available modeling databases (EPA).
Commenter statesthat neither the applicant, TCEQ, application, nor the draft permit comply with
federal and state laws requiring a demonstration that the proposed emissions will not cause or
contribute to air pollution in violation of a NAAQS or PSD increment limits in any air quality
control region (NCC, Public Citizen, SEED Coalition).
Response 19: The EPA requested an ozone modeling protocol. The TCEQ does not require
permit applicants to conduct the type offormal photochemical modeling protocol needed for SIP
analyses. The TCEQ did discuss screening approaches with the applicant that could be used for
the ozone analysis. The Applicant performed an ozone analysis consistent with TCEQ modeling
guidance. The analysis consists ofdeterminingthe methane-normalized VOC to NOx ratio using
the proposed emissions ofVOC and NOx. If the ratio is 2:1 or less, the site is considered to be
VOC-limited. The proposed WSEC site is VOC-limited. This analysis did not use the Scheffe
Method;as this method is not applicable to VOC,:,limited sources.
The intent ofthe phrase ""ozone neutral"" was to describe only the impact ofthe project in the area
near the site. Based on the lack ofVOCs, the NOx from the site would not significantly increase
ozone formation in this near area and would likely reduce it depending on local meteorology,
precursor emissions, and formed emissions on any given day.
The phrase was not meant to
qualify the project's effect downwind at larger distances, where plumes from the site could
contribute to ozone formation. The agency will not use this phrase in the future to avoid any
further confusion.
The EPA .is concerned that the ozone analysis is in direct conflict with control strategies
developed to reduce ozone in the nearby HGB Nonattainment Area. The TCEQ does not agree
with this concern. At this time, the TCEQ does not have a strategy to target emissions from
sources ofVOC or NOx within 100 and 200 kilometers, respectively, ofthese precursors outside
the HGB Nonattainment area. If strategies outside a nonattainment area are needed, the SIP
process is best suited to develop consistent and effective strategies that can be applied for a
specifiednonattainment area
The EPA is concerned that the site is located next to a nonattainment county. Based on HGB .
conceptual models for ozone exceedances and the location ofthe source, the source will not have
a significant impact downwind of the site.
The EPA suggests that the TCEQ should obtain
CAMx modeled concentrations at specific monitors to clearly demonstrate that the project's
impact will not significantly impact ozone levels in the HGB nonattainment area. The TCEQ is
concerned that the scope of the modeling and associated review required for multiple episodes
and monitors (and potential control scenarios for any monitors currently above the ozone
standard) would be costly, take up to a year to complete, and still not provide information to
definitively address EPA's concerns, since the EPA does not have an established significant

and the EPA has not provided, and TCEQ is not aware of, any method to demonstrate that the
contribution would not be significant.
For ozone, the EPA has no preferred model to determiee regional impacts. ofa single.souroe on

Modeling Approach' (EKMA). Since the EPA has no preferred model-for single-source ozone
impact analysis, the TCEQ uses the EKMA:as a screening toolfor.VOC-lirnitecl sources.
Additionally, EPA's current Guideline on Ai! Quality Models, 40 CFR SLAppendix W, sets
forth acceptable models for estimating ozone impacts in Section 5.2.1.

5.2.Lb both refer to the Guidance on the Use of Models and Other Analysesin.Attainment

TCEQ to provide written notice of any permit application for a proposed major stationary source

MEMORANDUM 
SUBJECT: 
New Source Review (NSR) Program Transitional Guidance 
FROM: 
John S. Seitz, Director 
Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (MD-10) 
TO: 
Addressees 
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (1990 Amendments) make numerous changes to 
the NSR requirements of the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) and nonattainment area 
programs. The 1990 Amendments create new and expanded nonattainment areas, extend PSD 
coverage to current Class I area boundaries, and mandate a PSD exemption for certain hazardous 
air pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to propose by September of 
this year a regulatory package that will implement these and other changes to the NSR provisions. 
Final adoption of these revised regulations is projected for August 1992. In the interim period 
between passage of the 1990 Amendments and adoption of the Agency's final regulations, EPA 
expects that numerous issues regarding the 1990 Amendments will arise. This memorandum sets 
forth the Agency's position on the most important of these transitional issues involving the NSR 
program. 
The Regional Offices should send this guidance document to their States. Questions from 
States and applicants concerning specific issues and cases should be directed to the appropriate 
EPA Regional Office. If you have any general questions, please contact Mr. Michael Sewell of 
the New Source Review Section at FTS 629-0873 or (919) 541-0873.

New Source Review (NSR) Transitional Guidance 
Toxics and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) Issues 
1.  
Section 112 Hazardous Air Pollutants are No Longer Considered Regulated Pollutants 
Under Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), but NESHAPS Still Apply 
Under the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (Act) and regulations issued 
thereunder, the PSD requirements of the Act apply to all ""major"" new sources and ""major"" 
modifications, i.e., those exceeding certain annual tonnage thresholds [see 40 CFR 
52.21(b)(1)(i) and (b)(2)(i)]. Typically, new sources and modifications become subject to 
PSD because they exceed the specified tonnage threshold for a criteria pollutant, i.e., a 
pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) has been established 
under section 109 of the Act. Once a new source or modification is subject to PSD, the 
PSD requirements apply to every pollutant subject to regulation under the Act that is 
emitted in ""significant"" quantities (or, in the case of a major modification, for which there 
is a significant net emissions increase) [see 40 CFR 52.21(b)(23) and (i)(2)]. Under the 
1977 Amendments, best available control technology (BACT) and other PSD 
requirements apply not only to emissions of criteria pollutants but also to emissions of 
pollutants regulated under other provisions of the Act, such as section 111 or 112. This 
regulatory structure was altered by the 1990 Amendments. 
Title III of the 1990 Amendments added a new 
section 112(b)(6) that excludes the hazardous air pollutants listed in section 112(b)(1) of 
the revised Act (as well as any pollutants that may be added to the list) from the PSD (and 
other) requirements of Part C. Thus, because they are on the initial Title III hazardous air 
pollutants list, the following pollutants, which had been regulated under PSD because they 
were covered by the section 112 NESHAPS or section 111 new source performance 
standards (NSPS) program, are now exempt from Federal PSD applicability: 
!  arsenic 
!  asbestos 
!  benzene (including benzene from gasoline)  
!  beryllium 
!  hydrogen sulfide (H2S)  
!  mercury 
!  radionuclides (including radon and polonium) 
!  vinyl chloride. 
The Title III exemption applies to final Federal PSD permits (i.e., those 
issued in final form and for which administrative appeals, if any, under 40 CFR 
124.19 have been exhausted) issued on or after the date of enactment of the 1990 
Amendments (November 15, 1990). For Federal PSD permit applications now 

2 
under review by either an EPA Regional Office or a delegated State, PSD permit 
requirements do not apply to the pollutants exempted by Title III. For Federal 
PSD permits containing PSD requirements for the pollutants exempted by Title III 
issued on or after November 15, 1990, the permittee may request a revision (e.g., 
removal of a BACT limit for benzene) to their PSD permit to reflect the Title III 
exemption from Federal PSD applicability. 
Note that pursuant to section 116 and the preservation clause in section 112(d)(7) 
of the amended Act, States with an approved PSD program may continue to regulate the 
Title III hazardous air pollutants now exempted from Federal PSD by section 112(b)(6) if 
the State PSD regulations provide an independent basis to do so. These State rules would 
remain in effect unless a State revised them to provide similar exemptions. Additionally, 
the Title III pollutants continue to be subject to any other applicable State and Federal 
rules; the exclusion is only for Part C rules. 
Finally, section 112(q) retains existing NESHAPS regulations by specifying that 
any standard under section 112 in effect prior to the date of enactment of the 1990 
Amendments shall remain in force and effect after such date unless modified as provided in 
the amended section. Therefore, the requirements of 40 CFR 61.05 to 61.08, including 
preconstruction permitting requirements, for new and modified sources subject to existing 
NESHAPS regulations are still applicable. 
In summary, the pollutants currently regulated under the Act as of March 
1991 that are still subject to Federal PSD review and permitting requirements are: 
!  carbon monoxide 
!  nitrogen oxides 
!  sulfur dioxide 
!  particulate matter and PM-10 
!  ozone (volatile organic compounds) 
!  lead (elemental) 
!  fluorides 
!  sulfuric acid mist 
!  total reduced sulfur compounds (including H2S) 
!  CFC's 11, 12, 113, 114, 115 
!  halons 1211, 1301, 2402 
!  municipal waste combustor (MWC) acid gases, MWC metals and MWC 
organics. 
2. 
Hazardous Air Pollutants that are Regulated as One Component of a More General 
Pollutant Under Other Provisions of the Clean Air Act are Still Regulated 
Any hazardous air pollutants listed in section 112(b)(1) which are regulated as 
constituents of a more general pollutant listed under section 108 of the Act are still subject 

3 
to PSD as part of the more general pollutant, despite the exemption in Title III. For 
example, volatile organic compounds (VOC's) (a term which includes benzene, vinyl 
chloride, methanol, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, and thousands of other compounds) are 
still regulated as VOC's (but not as individual pollutants such as benzene, etc.) under the 
PSD regulations because these pollutants are ozone precursors, not because they are air 
toxics. Also, particulates (including lead compounds and asbestos) are still regulated as 
particulates (both PM-10 and particulate matter) under the PSD regulations. Lead 
compounds are exempt from Federal PSD by Title III, but the elemental lead portion of 
lead compounds (as tested for in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, Method 12) is still 
considered a criteria pollutant subject to the lead NAAQS and still regulated under PSD. 
3. 
Toxic Effect of Unregulated Pollutants Still Considered in BACT Analysis 
Based on the remand decision on June 3, 1986 by the EPA Administrator in North 
County Resource Recovery Associates (PSD Appeal No. 85-2), the impact on emissions 
of other pollutants, including unregulated pollutants, must be taken into account in 
determining BACT for a regulated pollutant. When evaluating control technologies and 
their associated emissions limits, combustion practices, and related permit terms and 
conditions in a BACT proposal, the applicant must consider the environmental impacts of 
all pollutants not regulated by PSD. Once a project is subject to BACT due to the 
emission of nonexempted pollutants, the BACT analysis should therefore consider all 
pollutants, including Title III hazardous air pollutants previously subject to PSD, in 
determining which control strategy is best. 

4 
PSD Class I Boundary Issues 
1. 
PSD Applicability Coverage Changes as Class I Area Boundaries Change 
Sections 162(a) and 164(a) of the amended Act specify that the boundaries of 
areas designated as Class I must now conform to all boundary changes at such parks and 
wilderness areas made since August 7, 1977 and any changes that may occur in the future. 
The EPA does not believe that Congress intended to create the turmoil which would occur 
if this redesignation required the modification of permits issued between August 7, 1977 
and November 15, 1990, or the resubmission and reevaluation of complete permit 
applications submitted prior to enactment of the 1990 Amendments. Thus, for this reason, 
applications considered complete prior to November 15, 1990 should be processed as 
submitted without regard to the new Class I area boundaries. Exceptions to this general 
policy are in the areas of increment consumption and air quality related values (including 
visibility), as discussed below. 
For an applicant who submitted a complete PSD application prior to November 
15, 1990, if all other PSD requirements are met, a permit may be issued based on the Class 
I analysis as submitted in the application, unless the reviewing authority finds, on a case-
by-case basis, that additional analysis is needed from the applicant to address suspected 
adverse impacts or increment consumption problems due to the expanded boundaries of 
the Class I areas. Any existing increment violations in the new boundaries of Class I 
areas must be remedied through a SIP revision pursuant to 40 CFR 51.166(a)(3). 
The PSD applications not considered complete before November 15, 1990 must 
consider the impact of both existing sources and the new or modified source on the Class I 
areas as defined by the 1990 Amendments. Thus, the complete application must consider 
the impacts on the entire Class I area based upon the boundaries in existence on the date 
of submittal of a complete application; as before, if a Class I boundary changes before the 
permit is issued, the reviewing authority may find, on a case-by-case basis, that additional 
analysis is needed from the applicant to address suspected adverse impacts or increment 
consumption problems due to expanded Class I area boundaries. 
NSR Nonattainment Issues 

5 
1. 
NSR Construction Permit Requirements in Nonattainment Areas 
In many States, the existing approved Part D permit program by its terms covers 
all designated nonattainment areas in the State, so a Part D permit program will 
automatically apply to the new and expanded nonattainment areas which are established 
under provisions of Title I of the 1990 Amendments. Thus, until new rules are adopted 
for these new or expanded nonattainment areas, States should apply the requirements of 
their existing approved Part D permit program. However, in other States, a Part D 
program may be limited to specified areas and does not apply to new or expanded areas. 
In these areas, States must implement a transitional permitting program until their existing 
Part D programs are revised to meet the requirements of the 1990 Amendments and 
expanded to cover all nonattainment areas in the State. Otherwise, both the goals of Part 
D and Congress' intent in creating new or expanded nonattainment areas will be frustrated. 
The EPA regulations already provide for these new or expanded designated 
nonattainment areas because the Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling (40 CFR Part 51, 
Appendix S) governs permits to construct between the date of designation and the date an 
approved Part D plan is made applicable to the new nonattainment area [see 
40 CFR 52.24(k)]. Until a State's new Part D plan is approved by EPA, if a State wishes 
to issue a permit for a major stationary source or major modification in a new or expanded 
designated nonattainment area, the State should comply with the requirements of 
Appendix S. Among other things, Appendix S requires a major source seeking to locate 
in a nonattainment area to (1) meet the lowest achievable emission rate for such source, 
(2) provide offsets from existing sources in the area, and (3) show that the offsets will 
provide a positive net air quality benefit (see 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, section IV.A). 
The EPA believes that in order to carry out the intent of Appendix S, offsets should be 
required for sources in all categories and in all instances should be calculated on a tons per 
year basis (see 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, section IV.C). 
Of course, neither Appendix S nor the existing NSR rules incorporate the NSR 
changes mandated by Title I of the 1990 Amendments such as lower source applicability 
thresholds, increased emissions offset ratios, new definitions of major stationary source, 
and (for ozone nonattainment areas) requirements for nitrogen oxides (NOx) control and 
NOx emissions offsets. However, the 1990 Amendments require States to submit to EPA 
new NSR permit program rules for ozone nonattainment areas by November 15, 1992; for 
PM-10 nonattainment areas by June 30, 1992; and for most carbon monoxide (CO) 
nonattainment areas no later than 3 years from the date of the nonattainment designation. 
The EPA interprets this as an expression of congressional intent not to mandate that 
States adhere to the more stringent Title I NSR requirements in nonattainment areas 
during the time provided for State implementation plan (SIP) development. Thus, for 
NSR permitting purposes in nonattainment areas, the new NSR requirements in Title I are 
not in effect until the States, as required by the Act, adopt NSR permit program rules to 

6 
implement the Title I provisions. In addition, EPA encourages any State having adequate 
authority for early implementation of the NSR changes to do so as soon as possible. 
If States fail to submit to EPA the new NSR permit program rules for 
nonattainment areas by the deadlines in the amended Act, EPA intends to impose in these 
nonattainment areas a Federal implementation plan (FIP) embodying such requirements. 
Currently, EPA intends to propose revised NSR regulations at 40 CFR Part 52 that would 
implement the new Title I NSR requirements under a FIP in a State if that State's revised 
NSR rules to implement Title I are not submitted in approvable form to EPA and made 
effective within the State by the deadlines established by the 1990 Amendments. 
The area designation in effect on the date of permit issuance by the reviewing 
agency determines which regulations (Part C or Part D) apply to that permit. In other 
words, the PSD permit regulations apply to pollutants for which the area is designated as 
attainment or unclassifiable, and the NSR nonattainment permit regulations apply to 
pollutants for which the area is designated nonattainment [see 40 CFR 51.166(i)(3) and 
(5); and 40 CFR 52.21(i)(3) and (5)]. Under these regulations, a PSD permit for a 
pollutant cannot be issued in an area that is designated nonattainment for that pollutant. 
For the situation where a source receives a PSD or other permit prior to the date the area 
is designated as nonattainment, the permit remains in effect as long as the source 
commences construction within 18 months after the date of nonattainment designation of 
the area, does not discontinue construction for more than 18 months, and completes 
construction within a reasonable time [see 40 CFR 52.24(g) and (k)]. Although the PSD 
regulations provide for extension of these deadlines, no extension would be appropriate 
where the area has been designated as nonattainment following permit issuance. 
Accordingly, if any of these construction provisions are not met, the PSD permit or other 
permit will not be extended, and the source (if subject to the nonattainment provisions) 
must obtain a nonattainment permit prior to commencing (or continuing) construction. 
The 1990 Amendments create some new and expanded nonattainment areas by 
operation of law. Other nonattainment area changes are expected as the States and EPA 
complete the designation process prescribed in amended section 107(d). Because of these 
provisions, the dates areas switch from attainment to nonattainment for NSR purposes 
vary by pollutant. However, except for the two instances where the Amendments create 
changes by operation of law, the new designations and expanded boundaries will not be 
effective for NSR purposes until EPA promulgates the changes. The promulgations will 
be announced in the Federal Register. 
Congress create new PM-10 nonattainment areas through designations that 
became effective upon enactment of the 1990 Amendments on November 15, 1990[see 
section 107(d)(4)(B)]. Specifically, Congress designated Group I areas and areas where 
violations of the PM-10 NAAQS had occurred prior to January 1, 1989 as nonattainment. 
The EPA published a list of these PM-10 areas in a Federal Register notice (see 55 FR 

7 
45799,October 31, 1990; see also 52 FR 29383, August 7, 1987). The EPA plans to 
publish a notice in the Federal Register listing these areas as nonattainment in the near 
future, but they are already considered nonattainment areas as of November 15, 1990. 
Similarly, the 1990 Amendments expand by operation of law some CO and ozone 
nonattainment areas. However, these changes did not become effective with passage but 
rather on December 30, 1990. The specifics are as follows: 
Section 107(d)(4)(A)(iv) of the amended Act provides that, with the 
exception explained below, ozone and CO nonattainment areas located 
within metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) and consolidated metropolitan 
statistical areas (CMSA) which are classified as serious, severe, or extreme 
for ozone or as serious for CO are automatically expanded to include the 
entire MSA or CMSA. This expansion became effective by operation of 
law 45 days after enactment unless the Governor submitted a notice by this 
deadline of the State's intent to seek a modification of the expanded 
boundaries pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 107(d)(4)(A)(v). 
So if a State did not provide this notice, the nonattainment boundaries of 
all serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas in the State and 
all serious CO areas in the State expanded to include the entire MSA or 
CMSA on December 30, 1990. If a State did provide timely notice, the 
Administrator has up to 14 months from enactment to resolve the State's 
challenge. Until EPA promulgates a resolution of the State's challenge, the 
old boundaries remain in effect. 
Except for these two cases where new or expanded boundaries have been created 
by operation of law, nonattainment area changes will not be considered effective until the 
changes are promulgated by the EPA. As to most new areas or expansions of previously-
designated nonattainment areas, this will occur 240 days after enactment [see section 
107(d)(4)(A)(i) and (ii)]. Newly-created ozone and CO nonattainment areas will be 
considered part of a designated nonattainment area for NSR purposes at the time of 
promulgation. 
2. 
Status of Construction Bans 
Pursuant to section 110(n)(3), an existing construction ban that was imposed due 
to the absence of approved Part D NSR rules remains in effect until a revised NSR SIP is 
approved. Existing construction bans imposed due to disapproval of primary sulfur 
dioxide NAAQS attainment plans also remain in effect. A Federal Register notice will be 
published soon announcing the status of construction bans in general and also lifting 

8 
specific bans where appropriate. Should a construction ban be lifted in any area 
designated as nonattainment, and the area lacks an approved Part D NSR rule, the State 
should meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, in issuing permits to major 
new sources or major modifications prior to the adoption of NSR rules meeting the 
requirements of the 1990 Amendments. 
3. 
Federal Implementation Plans Remain in Effect 
The NSR permitting program in an existing FIP remains in effect until a SIP is 
approved or a revised FIP is adopted. 
4. 
Use of Previously-Approved Growth Allowances is Prohibited 
Section 173(b) invalidates growth allowances in existing SIP's in areas that 
received a SIP call prior to enactment of the 1990 Amendments, or that receive one 
thereafter. For NSR permits issued on or after November 15, 1990, previously-approved 
growth allowances cannot be used in these areas. Construction permits cannot be issued 
in SIP-call areas under existing EPA-approved Part D programs to the extent that such 
permits rely on previously-approved growth allowances. Case-by-case emission offsets 
must be obtained for any such permits, and other existing Part D requirements must be 
met. 
5.  
Existing NSR Permitting Rules Continue to Apply in the Northeast Ozone Transport 
Region (NOTR) 
The 1990 Amendments establish a single ozone transport region comprised of the 
States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the CMSA that includes the 
District of Columbia and part of the State of Virginia. For this transport region, including 
all attainment areas within its boundaries, new section 184(b)(2) specifies that any 
stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit at least 50 tons per year of VOC's 
shall be considered a major stationary source and subject to the requirements which would 
be applicable to major stationary sources if the area were classified as a moderate ozone 
nonattainment area. For NSR purposes, the requirements of section 184(b)(2) are not in 
effect in a State until the State submits a new or revised SIP that includes the requirements 
(or EPA imposes a FIP implementing those requirements). A State in the NOTR has until 
November 15, 1992 to submit to EPA the new or revised NSR rules addressing the new 
requirements.

Indiana

Dear Ms.
McCabe:
This is in response to your January 12,
2004, letter regarding
the implementation of New Source Review
(NSR)
in areas that will
be designated as nonattainment for the new 8-hour ozone standard.
We appreciate the work that your office has done to formulate and
raise to us the questions below.
We also understand that the
States are under a narrow time frame to get answers before the
designations for the new ozone standards go into effect.
The
following are your questions and our response.
1.
When will the new designations be considered effective?
Upon issuance of final letters to the Governors
(expected on
April 15,
2004)?
The designation notice will be signed no later than
April 15,
2004 and will provide the effective date.
time,
we expect the designations to be effective in
late May.
At this
mid to
2.
When will nonattainment new source review be required in
newly designated counties?
Please explain the legal basis
setting forth the requirements. '
The nonattainment NSR requirements apply to newly designated
nonattainment areas upon the effective date of the
designation.
After this effective date,
permits issued in
these areas must satisfy the part D nonattainment NSR
requirements,
as required by 40 CFR 52.24(k)
and 40 CFR part
51,
appendix S.
According to appendix S,
""a major new
source or major modification which would locate in an area
designated in 40 CFR 81.300 et seq.,
as nonattainment for a
pollutant for which the source or modification would be
major may be allowed to construct only if the stringent
conditions set forth below are met.""
These requirements
Recycled/Recyclable. Pronted wIth Vegetable 0,1 Based Inks on 100% Recycled Paper 150% Postconsumer)

-,
- 2 -
include applying the lowest achievable emission rate
(LAER)
and obtaining sufficient offsetting emission reductions to
assure that the new major source will not interfere with the
area's progress toward attainment.
A more detailed
discussion of 40 CFR 52.24(k)
and appendix S is set forth in
the proposed rule to implement the 8-hour ozone standard
(68
FR 32843-32848,
June 2,
2003).
Implementation of part D
nonattainment NSR requirements on the date of designation is
consistent with' our past guidance on this matter.
See ""New
Source Review Transitional Guidance"" at A-6
(March 11,
1991) .
3.
If an application is filed before the effective date of
designations but the permit is issued after that- date,
which
permitting rules apply,' attainment or nonattainment?
Again,
cites to appropriate sections of the Clean Air Act
(the Act) or
regulations would be helpful.
As we explained in our response to question 2, permits
issued in nonattainment areas must meet the part D
nonattainment NSR requirements as set forth in 40 CFR
52.24(k)
and appendix S.
An exemption is not provided for
sources that applied for a permit during the period when an
area was in attainment.
Furthermore,
under the federal
PSD
regulations,
the applicability of PSD requirements is
limited to ""an area designated as attainment or
unclassifiable.""
40 CFR 51.166(a) (7) (i); 52.21(a) (2) (i).
Therefore,
a
PSD permit for a pollutant cannot be issued in
an area that is designated nonattainment for that pollutant.
See ""New Source Review Transitional Guidance"" at A-6
(March
11,
1991).
As
a result,
a source that submits a permit
application before the nonattainment designation effective
date,
but does not obtain a final issued permit by the
effective date must apply for a part D nonattainment NSR
permit if emissions exceed the
majo~ source or major
modification threshold.
4.
Does the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)
Region V have any record of Indiana
addr~ssing or committing to
apply the requirements in 40 CFR part 51,
appendix S,
as an
element of its State Implementation Plan
(SIP)?
We are
researching our records, but thought it would be helpful if your
staff could investigate this as well,
since it would have
happened several decades ago, if at all.
Our staff have searched our records and were unable to find
any indications of a previous commitment from Indiana to
apply 40 CFR part 51,
appendix S.

- 3 -
5.
Could you please confirm the thresholds that will apply for
new sources and modifications in nonattainment areas?
will it be
100 tons per year for new sources and 40 tons per year for
modifications designated under Subpart 1 or marginal or moderate
under Subpart 2?
Pursuant to the definition of ""major stationary source"" in
§302(j) of the Act and 40 CFR 51.165(a) (1) (iv) (A) (1)
and the
definition of ""significant"" in 40 CFR 51.165 (a) (1) (x),
Subpart 1 nonattainment areas and marginal or moderate
Subpart 2 nonattainment areas will have a 100 tons per year
major source threshold and a 40 tons per year significance
threshold for triggering major NSR for ozone precursor
pollutants.
6.
For the designated ozone nonattainment areas, will it be
necessary for major new sources
(or major modifications) of
nitrogen oxides
(NOx)
to obtain emission offsets for NOx, given
that the States are ,now operating under a NOx budget pursuant to
the NOx SIP Call?
If yes, will the waiver procedure still be
available to States upon a demonstration that NOx reductions in a
particular area will be counterproductive?
In areas that are designated
~onattainment for ozone, major
new sources or major modifications must continue to obtain
offsets pursuant to §173 of the Act.
EPA has expressed the
view that nonattainment NSR offset requirements of the CAA
can be met using the mechanism of the NOx Budget Trading
Program, but has pointed out that integrating these programs
involves many complex issues.
63 Fed. Reg.
57355,
57475-76
(Oct.
27,
1998).
EPA is continuing to work toward resolving
these issues.
According to the June 2,
2003,
proposed rule to implement
the 8-hour ozone standard
(68
FR 32840),
the NOx waiver
procedure of §182(f) of the Act would still be available to
States upon a demonstration that net air quality benefits
are greater in the absence of reductions of NOx from the
sources concerned.
The preamble to the proposed rule
further provides that:
""for areas that were previously
granted a NOx waiver under the 1-hour ozone standard,
a re-
approval would be needed to make it clear that the exemption
applies,
to allow for public comment,
to be consistent with
the waiver guidance under the 8-hour standard
(once issued)
and to account for any new information that may point to a
different conclusion.""
It is important to note that, if
this provision is finalized as proposed, States will be
required to seek re-approval for the NOx waiver in 8-hour

- 4 -
ozone nonattainment areas.
7.
What will be the baseline date for offsets for NSR
permitting in new nonattainment areas?
To clarify,
we understand this question to be a request for
the baseline date after which emission reduction credits
remain available for the purpose of obtaining offsets for
NSR permitting.
The baseline date for NSR offsets in 8-hour
ozone nonattainment areas will be based on the date of the
emission inventory data or emission projections.
In most
areas, this will be 2002.
However,
in future years if there
are updated
e~issions inventories or projections used for an
attainment demonstration,
the new inventory or projection
date will replace the existing baseline date.
The
regulations governing offsets cah be found at 5l.165(a) (3).
8.
If a source has gotten a permit under the Prevention of
Significant Deterioration
(PSD)
program and does not construct
wi thin 18 months,
what permi tting rules will apply if the county
has now been designated nonattainment?
According to 40 CFR 52.2i(r) (2),
an approval to construct
(e.g.;
a
PSD permit)
becomes invalid if a source does not
commence construction within 18 months of permit issuance
(the regulation allows for an extension to the 18-month
period to construct upon a satisfactory showing that an
extension is justified,
however for the purpose of your
question we will presume that the permitting authority does
not grant an extension to an approval to construct).
If
this scenario occurs in a county that has since been
designated nonattainment,
consistent with our response to
question 2,
a source must obtain a new permit pursuant to
the part D nonattairiment NSR requirements that now apply in
that area.
The SIP-approved Indiana PSD regulation includes
language comparable to 40 CFR 52.21(r) (2)
in 326
lAC 2-2-
8 (1) .
9.
In the alternative site analysis required in nonattainment
NSR,
how does EPA interpret the phrase Usignificantly outweigh
the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of a
source's location,
construction or modification""?
How is this
measured?
Is'it still a case by case evaluation?
The alternative site qnalysis is required in §173(a) (5)
of
the Act.
This requirement continues to be a case-by-case
evaluation for NSR projects located in nonattainment areas.
Since this analysis is performed on a case-by-case basis,
we

- 5 -
are unable to provide a general answer on the interpretation
and measurement of the phrase ""significantly outweigh the
environmental and social costs imposed as a result of a
source's location, construction or modification. II
10.
Does EPA intend to revise or update appendix S
~nd what is
the agency's timeframe?
EPA is in the process of considering whether to update
appendix S or adopt a separate rule to address
preconstruction permitting during the SIP development
period.
See 68 FR 46536
(August 6,
2003) and
www.epa.gov/ttn/naags/ozone/o3imp8hr/documents/proprule / r eq=
text 073103.pdf.
At this time,
we are unable to provide a
time frame for this action.
We appreciate Indiana's efforts to transition to the new 8-hour
ozone standard.
We will continue to work with' your staff to
address NSR implementation issues.

FROM JEFF ROBINSON, EPA, REGION 6, CHIEF AIR PERMITS SECTION 
(MAY 21, 2008). 
 

UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
REGION 6
1445 ROSS AVENUE, SUITE 1200
DALLAS, TX 75202-2733
MAY 21 2008
.. Mr. Richard Hyde, P.E.
Director
Air Permits Division
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
P.O. Box 13087
Austin, TX 78711-3087
Dear Mr. Hyde:
Since March 2007, we have been discussing with your staffthe process for
addressing emissions from maintenance, start-up, and shutdown (MSS)activities in new
source permits for major sources. My staff has reviewed the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) draft model permit for MSS emissions e-mailed to us on
February 11, 2008. We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the draft
model permit.
The TCEQ's initiative to address MSS emissions through permits at major
stationary sources is related to changes in the State's Chapter 101 Excess Emissions rule,
which establishes an affirmative defense for excess emissions during MSS, but then
provides a schedule for phasing out the use of the affirmative defense for excess
emissions from planned MSS activities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has not yet taken rulemaking action on this State Implementation Plan (SIP)
revision. The EPA understands that these sources have combinations of Federal major
and minor New Source Review permits, as well as State permits that will need to be
amended. Reconciliations to correct terms and conditions in Prevention of Significant
DeteriorationINonattainment New Source Review permits, including adding or revising
requirements for MSS activities, should undergo the same process as the original Federal
Permit. This process would include a Best Available Control Technology (BACT) and/or
Lowest Achievable Control Technology (LAER) review, an air quality impact analyses,
and public participation requirements for all sources.
The EPA is concerned that the model permit may authorize increased emission
limits for maintenance ofcontrol devices that occurs during normal process operations.
The EPA's long-standing guidance states that maintenance for pollution control deviees
is a predictable event that can be scheduled at the discretion of the facility to coincide
with maintenance of process equipment. The Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ) should explicitly state that this permit does not authorize excess
RecycledIRecyclabie • Printed with Vegetable 011 Based Inks on 1000""Recycled Paper(40% Postconsumer)

2
emissions that occur as a result of maintenance activities of these control devices that
occurs during normal operations. Additionally, we are concerned that the draft permit
might be construed to allow sources to address MSS periods in a manner that is
inconsistent with Federal rules and regulations such as New Source Performance
Standard Subpart J, applicable consent decrees, current permit conditions, and the
approved SIP. The MSS permit should state that compliance with the most stringent
applicable requirement is required. The new source permit process may only be used to
address MSS from activities permitted in the original new source permit. Moreover,
terms in the permit cannot authorize emissions that are prohibited by Federal
requirements, including any requirements in the approved SIP. As noted above, any
modification of compliance obligations in current permits for periods of MSS may occur
only by reopening these permits and providing public participation consistent with the
public participation requirements for the initial permit.
Enclosed are our detailed comments. These comments were developed jointly
with EPA's Office of Air Quality and Planning Standards, the Office of Compliance
Assurance and Enforcement, the Office of General Counsel, and other EPA Regions.
Please note that while we have carefully considered the draft model permit and consulted
with other EPA offices, it is difficult to review the model permit in the abstract, without
consideration of source-specific information. As we indicate in the body of our
comments, the ultimate determination of emission limits and requirements for individual
sources will occur on a case-by-case basis to evaluate applicability issues, BACT, LAER,
air quality impacts and compliance monitoring and recordkeeping for the sources. Thus,
we may identify additional issues with the model permit as we review the analyses for
individual sources.
We look forward to continuing to work with TCEQ to resolve these issues.
Should you have any questions regarding our comments, please feel free to contact me or
you may contact Bonnie Braganza of my staff at (214) 665""7340.
Sincerely yours,

ENCLOSURE
1.
MSS emissions must be addressed through the SIP-approved new source permitting program
The EPA's long-standing interpretation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and Parts 51 and 52
requires a source subject to New Source Review (NSR) to evaluate its maximum capacity to
emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. EPA has stated that MSS
emissions are part of normal operation of a source and should be accounted for in planning,
design, and implementation of operating procedures for process and control equipment. I As
such, MSS emissions should have been included in Potentialto Emit (PTE) and subject to all
PSD and NNSR requirements, including public participation, BACT, and air quality analysis,
at the time of issuance of the original permit,. TCEQ's action to reconcile PSD and NNSR
permits should demonstrate that all program requirements are met.' MSS activities must be
authorized in permits issued under the Federally approved SIP
Emission increases resulting from maintenance activities should be minimal because those
events can be scheduled during process unit downtime. Maintenance of control devices
during process operations which would result in increased emissions should be prohibited
unless redundant control devices are operational.
The model permit indicates TCEQ may authorize MSS emissions by this site-wide permit
without reopening existing permits. As a preliminary matter, the only MSS emissions that
can be addressed through this permit are from units that have obtained or are obtaining a new
source permit. A unit cannot obtain an MSS permit allowing emissions but be
""grandfathered"" from new source program requirements in other respects (e.g., no Federal
BACT or LAER, etc...). Furthermore, EPA regards the inclusion ofMSS emissions related
to any SIP approved nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) or Prevention of
Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit program as a reopening of the original NSR permit to
correct the potential to emit (PTE) assumption. TCEQ should reopen and correct the PTE and
other terms and conditions in existing permits that will conflict with this permit.
1See, e.g., Memorandum from John B. Rasnic, Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division, Office of Air
Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. EPA, to Linda M. Murphy, Director, Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management
Division, U.S. EPA Region I (Jan. 28, 1993) (""Rasnic Memo"");
See Memorandum from Kathleen M. Bennett, Assistant Administrator for Air And Radiation, to the Regional
Administrators, entitled ""Policy Regarding Excess Emissions During Startup, Shutdown, Scheduled Maintenance,
and Malfunctions"" (February 15, 1983) (referred to hereafter as ""1983 Excess Emissions Policy"").

Section Chiefto J. David Sullivan, ALO Enforcement Section, Region VI, Request for Determination on Best
Available Control Technology Issues - Ogden Martin Tulsa Municipal Waste Incinerator Facility, Nov. 19, 1987.
1

A. BACT
1. Secondary BACT or LAER emission limits or an increase in existing BACT or
LAER emission limitations for MSS activities should be considered only after the
State has made an on-the-record determination that compliance with existing
emission limitations during periods of MSS is infeasible. 3 Allowing an increase in
allowable emissions or adding secondary emission limitations without this
demonstration is inconsistent with the definition of BACT and LAER. Note that
conditions in other existing NSR permits may not be superseded without reopening
and correcting terms and conditions in the relevant permit.
2.
Special Condition 12 should be restated to eliminate the exemption for combustion
units from Federally enforceable emission limits or BACT limits required by the
CAA (Federal BACT). The condition should provide for the development of an
alternative case by case Federal BACT limitation for MSS periods. The EPA has
noted that several permit applicants indicate using a TCEQ Tier approach of BACT.
This approach should be substantially equivalent to the Federal guidance on the
top/down BACT approach and be a case by case analysis. The duration for
startup/shutdown in this Special Condition 12 should be based on BACT.
EPA
recognizes that TCEQ has attempted to provide thresholds for the durations for
startup and shutdown activities. However, Federal BACT is based on a case by case
analysis based on the specific units that vary in size, age and control devices, and
therefore should not contain generalized BACT limits.
3.
BACT for the MSS activities should have numerical emission limits and/or specific
work practice standards that can be effectively monitored and recorded. It is not clear
that all the emission units identified in the Maximum Allowable Emission Rates
Table (MAERT) will have short term and annual limits.
B. Public Participation
EPA would like to emphasize our concern regarding public participation in the permitting of
MSS emissions. Texas' actions to reconcile PSD and NNSR permits at this time must ensure
that all permitting requirements in the original authorization, including public participation,
are met. EPA guidance and policy requires 30-day notice and comment on a draft permit
when a PSD PSD or NNSR permit is re-opened. EPA is aware that all the permit
applications were public noticed. However in developing the draft permits, several revisions
and updates were provided to TCEQ, such that the rationale for terms and conditions in some
draft permits may not represent the original public noticed permit applications. Additionally,
we understand that the modeling for the increased emission limits was.requested by TCEQ in
February 2008 and is still not complete, which means that the public has not had an
opportunity to comment on the modeling. The EPA questions whether this process meets the
SIP public participation requirements for major or minor NSR modificationslrevisions.
3 See, In re: Tallmadge Generating Station, PSD Appeal No. 02-12, (EAB, May 22, 2003) and In re: Rockgen
Energy Center, PSD Appeal No. 99-1, (EAB, August 25,1999).
2

Therefore, these draft permits should have a 30-day public notice and comment period.
Various environmental organizations have informed EPA that some permit applications.
claimed emission data as Confidential Business Information (CBI). Sections 110 and
1I4(c) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) require emission data to be made available to the
public, even if it otherwise qualifies as trade secret infonnation.4 EPA has determined
that emission data does not qualify as confidential if it meets the definition under 40 CPR
2.30l(a)(2)(l) for information necessary to determine the identity, amount, frequency, .
concentration, or other characteristics of any emission which has been emitted by the
source or information necessary to determine the identity, amount, frequency,
concentration, or other characteristics of the emission which, under an applicable
standard or limitation, the source was authorized to emit. We note that the Office of the
AttorneyGeneral of Texas also recently reviewed this requirement."". EPA recommends
. that TCEQ review permit applications to determine whether the CBI claims are allowed
under State and Federal law, and therefore whether the permit application is
administratively complete.
C. Air Duality Analyses
The EPA will provide comments on the modeling protocol for MSS emissions received
via email on February 20, 2008, at a later date.
EPA is requesting the modeling data
from the facilities or TCEQ for our records. TCEQ should consider emissions from
background sources in the modeling to ensure that these permits do not interfere with
attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS or PSD increments.
D. HoustonlOalvestonlBrazoria (HOB) area NSR applicability thresholds and offset ratios
and Title V applicability
. The EPA has proposed to grant the State's request to reclassify the HOB area from
moderate to severe nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone standard. However, even priorto
the time the area is reclassified to severe for the 8-hour standard, permitting for sources in
the HOB area should be consistent with the Non-attainment new source review (NSR)
and Title V based on the l-hour ozone nonattainment classification of severe for the
area.
In South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) v. EPA, 472 F.3d. 882
(D.C.Cir. 2006), the Court of Appeals reviewing EPA's rule for implementing the 8-hour
ozone standard decided that the EPA had improperly determined that areas designated as
non-attainment under the I-hour ozone NAAQS would no longer be subject to l-hour
NSR requirements. The effect of the court's ruling is to restore the applicability of the
4 See Notice of Policy on Public Emission Data within the meaning of Sections 110 and 114(c) of the Clean Air
Act (CAA), 56 FR 7042""01. February 21,1991.
5 See letter from Heather Pendleton Ross, Assistant Attorney General, Office of the Attorney General of Texas to
Mr. Robert Martinez, Director of Environmental Law Division, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, dated
July 30, 2007, reference number 0R2007-963I.

more stringent NSR thresholds and emission offsets that applied under the Act based on
an area's I-hour ozone classification.
Recordkeeping
Recordkeeping requirements must be sufficient to determine whether a facility is
operating in normal, startup, shutdown, and turnaround or maintenance mode to ensure
enforceability of the permit. In other words, the owner or operator must identify which
emission limitation or other requirements are applicable at all times. We recommend that
TCEQ revise the recordkeeping requirements to ensure that records are required to
document which mode of operation is current before the startup, shutdown, turnaround or
maintenance activity begins. The recordkeeping should state the start and end time ofthe
activity, not just the duration. The estimated quantity of each pollutant should be
expressed in terms of short-term limitations in the permit. Exceedances of the short-term
emission limitation must be documented and will be considered a violation of this permit.
II. Practical Enforceability
A. Permitting of MSS emissions should be incorporated into a permit issued under a SIP-
approved rule. We are aware that many of these facilities have flexible permits that are
not SIP-approved permits. For Federally enforceable permit terms, TCEQ may only use
the approved SIP rules for permitting of MSS. Where MSS emissions are incorporated
into a flexible permit, the.source has an authorization for those emissions under State law.
However, the source has no Federal authorization for MSS emissions under the SIP.
Therefore, the source should consider MSS emissionsas unauthorized under the SIP and
subject to all reporting requirements, including Federal Operating Permit (FOP) deviation
reporting and compliance certification. The flexible permit should be incorporated into
the FOP as a State-only requirement.
These exemptions from the Maximum Allowable Emission Rate Table (MAERT) limits
for periods of startup, shutdown, maintenance or malfunction are not authorized by EPA
because they would allow for circumvention of Federal CAA requirements. The
exemption is also inconsistent with the language of the model MSS permit. EPA believes,
at a minimum, underlying permits with such exemptions must be reopened to remove the
provision and other terms or conditions that are inconsistent with the MSS permit. We
also request that TCEQ include a statement in all permits issued under the SIP that when
there are multiple Federal or SIP requirements that apply to an emission source during
MSS periods, the most stringent requirement applies and that an exceedance of this
applicable emission limitation is a violation which may be subject to enforcement action.
B. The EPA has concerns regarding the enforceability of the MSS emission limits where an
older existing permit at a facility may contain an exemption from compliance with
emission limitations during periods of upset, startup, shutdown or maintenance activities.
We believe such exemption language is inconsistent with the model MSS permit. EPA
recommends that underlying permits with such exemptions be reopened to remove the
4

provision. Alternatively, please provide a method to ensure that exceedances of permit
emission limitations during periods of startup, shutdown, maintenance, and upsets can be
enforced as violations of the SIP. We also request that TCEQ include a statement in the
MSS permits that when there are multiple Federal or SIP requirements that apply to an
emission source during MSS periods, the most stringent requirement applies and that an
exceedance of this applicable emission limitation is a violation which may be subject to
enforcement action.
C. Special Condition I states ""Startup and shutdown emissions due to the activities
identified in Special Condition 2 are authorized from facilities and emission points in
other construction permits at the site provided the facility and emissions are compliant
with the respective MAERT and special conditions, or Special Condition 12 of this
permit.""
EPA is not clear how this condition can be practically enforceable. The MSS
permit cannot alter or supersede terms and conditions in an existing permit without
reopening and revising the existing permit. Since TCEQ is undertaking this effort
because planned MSS emissions were not specifically subject to specific limits in
existing permits, the MSS permitting actions should address all units that have MSS
activities and emissions from the site.
D. Please ensure that the applicable leak detection program for the site is addressed in this
permit.
III. Permits by Rule (PBR)
We also are concerned that these sources can use the Permit by Rule (PBR) to amend the
MSS emissions in these permits. The Permit by Rule should only be used for small minor
sources (PTE less than lOOTPY12S0TPY) and is not a vehicle for major sources to
.
supplement emission limits or conditions in a Federally enforceable permit. EPA has
consistently expressed concerns about PBRs that authorize a category of emissions, such as
MSS, or that modify an existing NSR permit."" ThesePBRs are inconsistent with the
approved SIP and may serve as a circumvention of CAA requirements. At a minimum,
condition II should be removed from the modelpermit.
IV. Comments on Special Conditions of the model permit.
A. The model permit should contain the provision that MSS activities not listed in the permit
are not authorized. Special Condition 2 refers to MSS activities in the permit application.
In most cases the permit applications were revised extensively, therefore EPA believes
. that references to activities in a permit application are not practically enforceable unless
6 Letter dated November 16, 2007 to Mr. Richard Hyde regarding Comments on Proposed Amendments to Chapter
106, 116 for Maintenance Startup 'and Shutdown (MSS), Chapter 106 Subchapter K
Letter dated March 30, 2006 to Mr. Steve Hagle regarding comments on Proposed Rule Revisions to 30 Texas
Administrative Code Chapter 106 and 116 and to the State Implementation Plan B Rule Project Number 2005-016-
106-PR;
5

TCEQ provides a cross-walk and rationale for the differences between the permit and
permit application. Please explain what type of exceptions TCEQ expects to see in
Special Condition 10 regarding a planned process unit startup.
B. Special Condition 3 provides the process for degassing, emptying and depressurizing of
process units and facilities. This condition should require a case by case assessment of
the types and quantities of air pollutants.
TCEQ should provide the rationale for the
conclusion that venting to the atmosphere of pollutants below 0.5 psi and 50 Ibs has a
negligible air quality impact and is consistent with other Federal requirements and
standards. The permit should also indicate monitoring requirements for determining
when the condition of 50 Ibs is reached.
C. Special Condition 7 appears to have a typographical error and should read ""Special
Condition 6.B (i) through 6.B(v)""
D. Special Condition 9 requires frac or temporary tanks that are used to support MSS and
that are exposed to the sun to be white or aluminum effective May 1, 2013. If the
emissions are minimized by these requirements, this should be considered BACT at the
time of permit issuance.
Please remove the effective date requirement of May 1,2013 in
this condition.
E. It is not clear how TCEQ will apply Special Condition 12 universally to all combustion
sources without referring to the current existing limits, units and permits. EPA
recommends that this permit identify the existing limit for each combustion unit at the
site and then identify the secondary (MSS) BACT limit or work practice standard to
make this practically enforceable.
F. Please clarify if Special Condition 13 only applies to control devices used during periods
of MSS. This permit should not supersede any previous Federal conditions in current
permits, unless a case by case rationale is provided and the underlying permit is
reopened. EPA believes that BACT should consider having redundant control devices.
G. For the control devices in Specific Condition 13, the method for monitoring compliance
should be specified for the Internal Combustion engines. Please clarify if these are the
only required control devices to be used during MSS activities and if this list will be
updated as new technology to control these emissions are developed.
H. Special Condition 14 refers to capture systems for flare control devices. The monitoring
condition in 14A should be performed during an MSS activity to determine compliance
with the emission rates, not on a monthly or annual basis. Special Condition 14 states ""A
deviation shall be reported if the monitoring or inspections indicate bypass of the control
device."" However this condition is allowing the bypass of a control device. Please clarify
the language. The permit must not provide for automatic exemption to allow bypass of
an emission control device.
6

V. General Comments:
A. Please provide definitions for startup, shutdown and maintenance activities. It is possible
that startup, shutdown and maintenance are specific to the source and therefore these
definitions may need to be included in each permit. As we have discussed earlier, EPA's
guidance states that maintenance activities are a planned and predictable event that can be
scheduled at the discretion of the operator to coincide with maintenance of production
equipment. TCEQ's BACT evaluation for MSS activities must eliminate or minimize
periods during which production equipment operates without control devices.
B. Attachment A to the permit application was missing. That Attachment identifies a list of
activities with low emissions that are performed numerous times each year. It appears
that these activities will be exempt from emission monitoring.
Similarly, the draft you
provided us did not include Attachment B to the permit application, which identifies
maintenance activities involving equipment/facilities such as valves, pumps, piping, and
heat exchangers. Itis expected that these attachments will be site specific. Therefore our
comments are limited to information provided in the model permit and additional
comments will be provided at the time EPA reviews the site specific permits. Please note
that there can be no exemption for MSS activities as indicated in the Special Conditions
of the model permit.
.
C. The specific conditions related to the MAERT and Facility List table are not clear, since
there are no emission estimates associated with the emission units. Each emission unit
should have an applicable short term emission limit. EPA understands that these
provisions may be clarified when the source specific permit is reviewed and we may
provide additional comments at that time.
D. The permit does not contain monitoring for the special conditions in this permit with the
exceptions of some control devices that are listed in the permit. Monitoring and
recordkeeping are required to determine compliance with permit terms and conditions.
E. EPA is also concerned that there are no PM considerations for catalyst loading activities
that happen frequently during major unit turnarounds. BACT for these activities should
be considered using control devices such as filters baghouses etc.
F. Please clarify how the MSS emissions are included in this permit on an annual and short
term basis for units that have a turnaround frequency of less than a year.
G. There are references in the permit to using ""good engineering practice"" to reduce
emissions such as Specific Condition 6 B (ii).
BACT in the permit should be specific
with respect to emission limits, and work practice standards should only be used when
numerical emission limits are infeasible. All BACT terms and conditions should require
monitoring and recordkeeping sufficient to ensure compliance.
Monitoring should be
done by approved EPA methods or other approved methods that are replicable under
these operating conditions.

FACILITY EMISSION EVENT INFORMATION 

June 12,2009
President and Chief Executive Officer
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP
1000I Six Pines Drive
The Woodlands, Texas 77380
Van Long, Cedar Bayou Plant Manager
Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.- Cedar Bayou
9500 I-10 East Exit 796
Baytown, Texas 77521-9570
Dear Sirs:
I write on behalf of Environment Texas and Sierra Club (""the Citizen Groups"")
and their members.
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, Lp 1 (""Chevron Phillips"") owns and
operates a petrochemical plant in Baytown, Texas (the plant is hereafter referred to as the
""Cedar Bayou Plant"").
Based on available information, the Citizen Groups believe that
Chevron Phillips has repeatedly violated, and will continue to violate, its air emission
permits, the Texas State Implementation Plan, and the federal Clean Air Act (""CAA"") by
emitting air pollutants into the atmosphere from the Cedar Bayou Plant in excess of
applicable emission limitations.
Applicable Clean Air Act Requirements
The Texas State Implementation Plan (""SIP"") is a set of state laws and regulations
designed to protect air quality in Texas and, more specifically, to achieve compliance
with federally promulgated national ambient air quality standards (""NAAQS""). SIPs are
required by Section 110 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.c. § 7410, and must be approved by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"").
1 Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical
Company LLC. This letter also serves to notify Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC of violations at
the Cedar Bayou Plant.
West Coast Office: Seattle, WA
printedon recyded paper

The Cedar Bayou Plant contains a number of fixed sources of air pollution that
are classified as ""stationary sources"" under the Clean Air Act. The Texas SIP requires
Chevron Phillips to report certain unauthorized emissions of air pollutants from these
stationary sources to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (""TCEQ"") within
24 hours of their discovery. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 101.201(a) and 101.211(a).
Thereafter, Chevron Phillips has two weeks to issue a ""final"" report concerning such
emission events; if no final report is submitted, the initial report is considered final. 30
Tex. Admin. Code §§ 101.201(b) and (c) and 101.211(b) and (c).
These emission event reports submitted by Chevron Phillips to TCEQ include,
among other information: the date, time, and duration of the event; the nature and cause
of the event; any corrective action taken; the unit and the specific emission point from
which pollutants were emitted to the atmosphere; the permit or regulation applicable to
the unit and emission point; the emission standard or limitation that has been exceeded;
and the type and estimated quantities of air pollutants emitted.
Emissions of air pollutants from the Cedar Bayou Plant are governed by, among
other requirements, Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit (""PSD Permit"") No.
PSD-TX-748 and Texas New Source Review Permit (""NSR Permit"") Nos. 1504A,
37063, 2462C, 46305 and 19027, issued to Chevron Phillips by the TCEQ pursuant to 30
Tex. Admin. Code § 116. These permits contain Maximum Allowable Emission Rate
Tables (""MAERTs"") that set forth, for each source of air pollutants governed by each
permit, a maximum hourly emission limit (expressed in pounds per hour) and a maximum
annual emission limit (expressed in tons per year) for each pollutant authorized to be
discharged during normal operations. Some of the MAERTs also include maximum
hourly emission limits and maximum annual emission limits for each pollutant authorized
to be discharged from a source during start-up, shutdown and/or maintenance activities.
Compliance with the numerical emission limits in the MAERTs is mandatory. Texas
Health & Safety Code § 382.085(b); 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116.115(b)(2)(F).
Chevron Phillips' NSRlPSD Permits and all ofthe emission standards and
limitations contained therein have been incorporated into federal operating permits, Nos.
0-2113,0-2114,0-2115, and 0-2370, issued pursuant to Title V of the Clean Air Act,
42 U.S.C. §§ 7661-7661f. Any release of air pollutants into the atmosphere (I) in excess
of an hourly or annual emission limit contained in any of Chevron Phillips' NSRlPSD
permits, (2) from an emission point not authorized to emit such pollutants, or (3) not
authorized to be released, is a violation of both the applicable NSRlPSD permit and the
corresponding Title V permit. All such releases also violate both the Texas SIP and the
federal Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7604(a)(I) and(f) and 7661a(a).
In addition, the stationary sources at the Cedar Bayou Plant referenced above are
""new sources"" within the meaning of Section 111(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §
7411(a)(2), and are ""affected facilities"" within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. § 60.2.
Accordingly, they are subject to federal New Source Performance Standards (""NSPS""),
which are national, technology-based emission standards and limitations promulgated
pursuant to Section 111,42 U.S.C. § 7411.
2

Pursuant to CAA section 111(b), 42 U.S.C. § 7411(b), EPA promulgated general
NSPS provisions, codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart A, §§ 60.1-60.19, that apply to
owners and operators of any stationary source that contains an ""affected facility"" subject
to regulation under 40 C.F.R. Part 60. 40 C.F.R. § 60.II(d) requires that at all times-
including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction - owners and operators shall, to
the extent practicable, maintain and operate any affected facility, including associated air
pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control
practice for minimizing emissions. 40 C.F.R. § 60.18(c) requires, among other things,
that flares used to comply with applicable subparts of 40 C.F.R. Parts 60 and 61 be
operated with no visible emissions (except for periods not to exceed five minutes during
any two consecutive hours) and with the presence of a flame at all times.
CAA Section 111(e), 42 U.S.c. § 7411(e), prohibits the operation of any new
source in violation of an NSPS applicable to such source. Thus, a violation of an NSPS
is a violation of Section 111(e) of the Clean Air Act, as well as a violation ofthe Cedar
Bayou Plant's applicable PSD or NSR permit and Title V permit, each ofwhich
incorporates applicable NSPS requirements.
In addition, stationary sources at the Cedar Bayou Plant are subject to national
emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (""NESHAPs"") promulgated by EPA
pursuant to Section 112(d) of the Act, 42 U.S.c. § 7412(d). Pursuant to SectionI12(d),
EPA promulgated general NESHAPs provisions, codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 61, Subpart
A, §§ 61.1-61.19, that apply to owners and operators of any stationary source for which a
NESHAP is prescribed. 40 C.F.R. § 61.12(c) requires that owners and operators shall
maintain and operate the source, including associated air pollution control equipment, in
a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions.
A violation of 40 C.F.R. § 61.12(c) is a violation of the Clean Air Act, as well as
a violation ofthe Cedar Bayou Plant's applicable PSD or NSR permit and Title V permit,
each of which incorporates this regulatory requirement.
In addition, the Cedar Bayou Plant has vent gas streams containing highly-
reactive volatile organic compounds (""HRVOCs""), as defined in 30 Tex. Admin. Code §
115.10, and flares that emit or have the potential to emit HRVOCs. Accordingly, the
Cedar Bayou Plant is prohibited from emitting more than 1,200 pounds ofHRVOCs in
anyone-hour block period from any flare, vent, pressure relief valve, cooling tower, or
any combination thereof. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 115.720(a) and 115.722(c)(l). Any
violation of this emission limitation is a violation ofthe Cedar Bayou Plant's state and
federal permits, the Texas SIP, and the federal Clean Air Act.

Chevron Phillips's Clean Air Act Violations
Hourly MAERT Limits
Chevron Phillips has, on numerous occasions, emitted air pollutants into the
atmosphere from the Cedar Bayou Plant in amounts or at rates that exceeded applicable
hourly permit limits.
A description of such emissions from the Cedar Bayou Plant during emission
events occurring from February 2003 through May 20092 is contained in the attached
Table I. For each such emission of pollutants, Table I contains: the emission event
tracking number; the start and end dates of the emission event; the applicable NSR permit
number or regulation, if any (under the heading ""Authorization""); Chevron Phillips'
characterization of the event (""emission event"" is abbreviated as ""EE""); the unit and
emission point from which the emissions occurred (""facility identification number"" is
abbreviated as ""FIN"" and ""emission point number"" is abbreviated as ""EPN""); the type
and amount of pollutant(s) emitted (the amount is expressed as a percentage in the case of
opacity); the duration ofthe emission event; and the reported applicable emission
standard or limitation.
The pollutant types and amounts and the applicable emission standards and
limitations listed in Table I are set forth just as Chevron Phillips reported them on its
emission event reports to TCEQ. The ""reported"" emission limits, however, may differ
from the actual permit limits in effect. For example, Chevron Phillips' PSD and NSR
permits impose limits on total Volatile Organic Compounds; but Chevron Phillips, in its
emission event reports, frequently reports pollutant releases and the applicable emission
limits separately for each individual VOC. Similarly, Chevron Phillips frequently reports
nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions and their applicable limits separately, even
though its permits impose limits on total oxides of nitrogen (""NOx""). For convenience,
Table I includes, for each emissions event, the individualized pollutant emissions as they
were reported by Chevron Phillips, and also a calculated entry for ""Total VOCs"" and
""Total NOx."" The information presented in Table I is sufficient to enable Chevron
Phillips to ascertain the nature of each alleged violation and when and where it occurred.
In addition, Chevron Phillips' PSD and NSR permits do not authorize fugitive
emissions of air pollutants. Although numerical amounts are listed for certain fugitive
sources in the MAERTs and reported as applicable emission limits by Chevron Phillips
(as reflected in Table I), the permits state that such amounts are ""an estimate only and
should not be considered as a maximum allowable emission rate."" The actual emission
limit on all fugitive emissions is therefore zero.
2 The Citizen Groups do not intend to file suit to enforce violations occurring more than five years before
the date of this letter.
4

AnnualMAERT Limits
Chevron Phillips has, on numerous occasions, emitted air pollutants into the
atmosphere from the Cedar Bayou Plant in amounts that exceed applicable annual permit
limits. A description of such permit violations at the Cedar Bayou Plant resulting solely
from emission events occurring from December 2003 tluough May 2009 is contained in
the attached Table 2. For each such violation of an annual permit limit, Table 2 contains:
the applicable NSR permit number; the number of the emission point from which the
emissions occurred; the type and amount of pollutant discharged; the applicable tons per
year limit; and the rolling 12-month period during which each violation occurred (or is
still occurring).
Moreover, the pollutants released during the emission events described in Table I
may, when added to the ""routine"" pollutant emissions occurring during normal operations
at Chevron Phillips' Cedar Bayou Plant, have contributed to additional violations oftons
per year limits not reflected in Table 2. This notice letter covers all such violations of
annual tons per year limits.
HRVOC Limits
Chevron Phillips has, on numerous occasions, emitted HRVOCs into the
atmosphere from the Cedar Bayou Plant in amounts or at rates that exceeded the hourly,
site-wide HRVOC limit in the Texas SIP and incorporated into Chevron Phillips'
permits. A description of such HRVOC violations at the Cedar Bayou Plant is contained
in the attached Table 3. The information in Table 3 is based on the emission event
information reported by Chevron Phillips to TCEQ. For each such violation of the hourly
HRVOC limit, Table 3 contains: the emission event tracking number; the start date and
time, end date and time, and duration of the emissions; the amount ofHRVOCs released;
and the hourly emission limit.
Unauthorized Startup, Shutdown and Maintenance Emissions
Special Condition 3 ofNSR Permit No. 1504A, Special Condition 3 ofNSR
Permit No. 37063, and Special Condition 10 ofNSR Permit No. 2462C each
authorize emissions only from the specified maintenance, startup or shutdown activities
at the specified emission points described in each permit condition. Special Condition 3
of Permit No. 1504A and Special Condition 3 of Permit No. 37063 provide further that
any maintenance, start-up, or shutdown activities not specifically listed ""are not
authorized by this permit."" The applicable emission limit for any such non-listed
maintenance, startup or shutdown activities at the units covered by these permits is
therefore zero pounds per hour.
Table 4 identifies emission events that involved startup, shutdown or maintenance
activities and that Chevron Phillips reported as being authorized by either Permit No.
5

1504A, 37063 or 2462C and as therefore subject to an emission limit greater than zero.:'
For each of these emission events, Table 4 contains: the emission event tracking number;
the start and end dates and times of the emission event; the applicable permit number;
Chevron Phillips' characterization of the event; the unit and emission point from which
the emissions occurred.
Because each of the emission events described in Table 4 involved unauthorized
startup, shutdown or maintenance activities, each constitutes a violation ofthe applicable
special condition described above. In addition, because each report Chevron Phillips
submitted to TCEQ for the emission events in Table 4 contained an incorrect emission
limit applicable to these events, each report constitutes a violation of30 Tex. Admin.
Code §§ 101.201(b)(1)(H) or 101.211(a)(I)(I) and (b)(l)(I) (requiring reporting of
authorized emissions limits, if any, for the facilities involved).
General NSPS and NESHAP Requirements
The unauthorized releases of air pollutants described in Tables I and 2 and in the
HRVOC table above also constitute violations of 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart A, including,
but not limited to, §60.II(d) (relating to good air pollution control practices) and 40
C.F.R. Part 61, Subpart A, including, but not limited to, § 61.12(c) (also relating to good
air pollution control practices).
In addition, the emission events identified by tracking numbers 17017,24350,
26276,31334, and 37194 in Table I constitute violations of40 C.F.R. § 60.18(c)(l),
regarding visible emissions from flares, and the emission events identified by tracking
numbers 65091,70394,70583,70666,70786,75108,76377,114137, and 114138 in
Table I constitute violations of 40 C.F.R. §60.18(c)(2), requiring the presence of a flame
at all times during operation of a flare.
This notice letter and the attached tables are based on publicly available sources
of information. Additional information, including information in the possession of
Chevron Phillips, may reveal additional details about the violations described above and
may reveal additional violations ofthe Clean Air Act at the Cedar Bayou Plant. This
letter covers all such violations.
The Citizen Groups intend to file suit against Chevron Phillips in federal court to
secure appropriate relief under state and federal law for all violations described in this
notice letter occurring within the five years immediately preceding the sending of this
letter, and for any similar violations that occur after the date of this notice letter.
3 The events listed in Table 4 are also included in Table 1. Thus, even ifany of the activities were in fact
authorized, the emissions would still violate the emission standards and limitations described on p. 4,
above.

If you believe any of the above information is in error, or if you take steps to
permanently correct any of the described violations, or ifyou believe you are currently in
compliance with the Clean Air Act, or if you have any questions concerning this letter or
the described violations, please contact me as soon as possible at (617) 747-4333 or at the
address listed above. If you would like to meet in person to discuss this matter, we are
available to meet in Houston during the week of July 6 or the week of July 20.

Dear Mr. Hofmeister, Mr. Tanner, Ms. Methvin, and Ms. Mujica:
I write on behalf of Environment Texas and Sierra Club (""the Citizen Groups""),
and their members.
The Deer Park Refining Limited Partnership (""Deer Park Refining"") and Shell
Deer Park Refining Company operate an oil refinery in Deer Park, Texas (the ""Deer Park
Refinery""). The Shell Chemical Limited Partnership (""Shell Chemical"") operates a
petrochemical facility at the same site (the ""Deer Park Chemical Plant""). Shell Oil
Company is the general partner of Deer Park Refining and of Shell Chemical. These four
companies are jointly referenced in this letter as ""Shell."" The Deer Park Refinery and
Deer Park Chemical Plant are jointly referenced in this letter as ""Shell Deer Park.""
Based on available information, the Citizen Groups believe that Shell has
repeatedly violated, and will continue to violate, its air emission permits, the Texas State
West Coast Office: Seattle,WA
printed onrecyded paper

Implementation Plan, and the federal Clean Air Act by emitting air pollutants into the
atmosphere from Shell Deer Park in excess of applicable emission limitations.
Applicable Requirements
The Texas State Implementation Plan (""SIP"") is a set of state laws and regulations
designed to protect air quality in Texas and, more specifically, to achieve compliance
with federally promulgated national ambient air quality standards (""NAAQS""). SIPs are
required by Section 110 ofthe Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.c. § 7410, and must be approved by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"").
The Deer Park Refinery and the Deer Park Chemical Plant each have a number of
fixed sources of air pollution that are classified as ""stationary sources"" under the Clean
Air Act. The Texas SIP requires Shell to report certain unauthorized emissions of air
pollutants from these stationary sources to the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (""TCEQ"") within 24 hours of their discovery. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §
101.201(a). Thereafter, Shell has two weeks to issue a ""final"" report concerning such
emission events; if no final report is submitted, the initial report is considered final. 30
Tex. Admin. Code § 101.201(b) and (c).
These emission event reports submitted by Shell to TCEQ include, among other
information: the date, time, and duration of the event; the nature and cause of the event;
any corrective action taken; the unit and the specific emission point from which
pollutants were emitted to the atmosphere; the permit or regulation applicable to the unit
and emission point; the emission standard or limitation that has been exceeded; and the
type and estimated quantities of air pollutants emitted.
Emissions of air pollutants from the Deer Park Refinery are governed by, among
other requirements, New Source Review Permit (""NSR Permit"") No. 21262, issued to
Deer Park Refining by the TCEQ pursuant to 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116. This permit
contains a Maximum Allowable Emission Rate Table (""MAERT"") that sets forth, for
each source of air pollutants governed by the permit, a maximum hourly emission limit
(expressed in pounds per hour) and a maximum annual emission limit (expressed in tons
per year) for each pollutant authorized to be discharged.
Emissions of air pollutants from the Deer Park Chemical Plant are governed by,
among other requirements, NSR Permit Nos. 1968,3214,3215, 3216, 3217, 3219, 3173,
3179,9334, 18576,46535,48912,52088, and 55312, issued to Shell Chemical by the
TCEQ pursuant to 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 116. These permits contain MAERTs that set
forth, for each source of air pollutants governed by the permit, a maximum hourly
emission limit and a maximum annual emission limit for each pollutant authorized to be
discharged.
Shell Deer Park's NSR Permits, and all of the emission standards and limitations
contained therein, have been incorporated into federal operating permits issued pursuant
to Title V of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.c. §§ 7661-7661f. Any release of air pollutants
2

into the atmosphere in excess of an hourly or annual emission limit contained in any of
Shell Deer Park's NSR permits is thus a violation of both the applicable NSR permit and
the corresponding Title V permit. All such releases also violate both the Texas SIP and
the federal Clean Air Act.
In addition, the stationary sources at Shell Deer Park referenced above are ""new
sources"" within the meaning of Section 111(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.c. §
7411(a)(2), and are ""affected facilities"" within the meaning of 40 C.P.R. § 60.2.
Accordingly, they are subject to New Source Performance Standards (""NSPS""), which
are technology-based emission standards and limitations promulgated pursuant to Section
111,42 U.S.C. § 7411.
Pursuant to Section 111(b), 42 U.S.C. § 7411(b), U.S. EPA has promulgated
general NSPS provisions, codified at 40 C.P.R. Part 60, Subpart A, §§ 60.1 - 60.19, that
apply to owners or operators of any stationary source that contains an ""affected facility""
subject to regulation under 40 c.P.R. Part 60. 40 C.P.R. § 60.II(d) requires that at all
times - including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction - owners and operators
shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate any affected facility, including
associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution
control practice for minimizing emissions. 40 c.P.R. § 60.18(c) requires flares to be
operated with no visible emissions except for periods not to exceed five minutes during
any two consecutive hours.
Section III(e), 42 U.S.c. § 7411(e), prohibits the operation of any new source in
violation of an NSPS applicable to such source. Thus, a violation of an NSPS is a
violation of Section III(e) of the Clean Air Act.
Shell Deer Park's Violations
During the five years immediately preceding the date of this letter, Shell Deer
Park has, on numerous occasions, emitted air pollutants into the atmosphere in amounts
or at rates that exceeded applicable hourly or annual permit limits.
A description of such emissions from the Deer Park Refinery from February 2003
to the present is contained in the attached Table I. A description of such emissions
occurring at the Deer Park Chemical Plant from February 2003 to the present is contained
in the attached Table 2. A description of such emissions from Shell Deer Park for which
the Citizen Groups have insufficient information to determine the source plant is
contained in the attached Table 3.
For each such emission of pollutants, Tables 1,2, and 3 contain: the emission
event tracking number; the start and end dates of the emission event; the applicable NSR
permit number or regulation, if any (under the heading ""Authorization""); Shell's
characterization of the event (""emission event"" is abbreviated as ""EE""); the unit and
emission point from which the emissions occurred (""facility identification number"" is
abbreviated as ""FIN"" and emission point number is abbreviated as ""EPN""); the type and
3

amount of pollutant(s) emitted (the amount is expressed as a percentage in the case of
opacity); the duration of the emission event; and the emission standard or limitation that
has been violated.
Unless stated otherwise in the tables, the pollutant types and amounts and the
applicable emission standards and limitations listed in Tables I, 2, and 3 are set forth just
as Shell reported them on its emission event reports to TCEQ, and may therefore differ
from the actual permit limits in effect. For example, Shell's NSR permits appear to
impose limits on total VOCs and total NOx; but Shell, in its emission event reports,
frequently reports pollutant releases and the applicable emission limits separately for
each individual VOC and each oxide of nitrogen. Similarly, in cases where the permits
impose a single limit on multiple emission points, Shell sometimes reports the emission
points separately. In other cases, the applicable emission limit is zero but Shell reports a
nonzero limit (e.g., O.OOllbs/hr). Nonetheless, the information presented in Tables 1,2,
and 3 is more than sufficient to enable Shell to ascertain the nature of each alleged
violation.
In addition to the hourly limit violations described in Tables I, 2, and 3, the
information summarized in Table 2 also establishes violations of at least the following
annual tons per year limits at the Deer Park Chemical Plant:

* A specific date indicates that the annual tons per year limit was exceeded on a
single day or by a single emission event that resulted in a release of pollutants.
Moreover, the pollutants released during the emission events described in Tables 1,2,
and 3 may, when added to the ""routine"" pollutant emissions occurring during normal
operations at Shell Deer Park, have contributed to additional violations of tons per year
limits. This notice letter covers all such violations of annual tons per year limits.
The unauthorized releases of air pollutants described in Tables 1, 2, and 3 also
constitute violations of 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart A, including, but not limited to, §
4

60.11(d) (relating to good air pollution control practices) and § 60.18(c) (relating to the
operation of flares).
Tables 1,2, and 3 are based on publicly available sources of information.
Additional information, including information in the possession of Shell, may reveal
additional details about the violations listed and may reveal additional violations of the
Clean Air Act at Shell Deer Park. This letter covers all such violations occurring within
the five years immediately preceding the sending of this notice letter. This letter fulfills
the Clean Air Act's pre-suit notice requirements.
The Citizen Groups would like to discuss this matter with you. Their goal is to
improve air quality in the area surrounding Shell Deer Park by securing long-term
compliance with applicable law. Please contact me at (617) 747-4333 or at the address

Enforceability Requirements for Limiting potential to Emit 
Through SIP and §112 Rules and General Permits 
Introduction 
As several EPA guidance describe, there are several 
mechanisms available for sources to limit potential to emit. EPA 
guidance have also describe the importance of practical 
enforceability or the means used to limit the Potential to Emit. 
This guidance is intended to provide additional guidance on 
practical enforceability for such limits. We provide references 
for guidance an practical enforceability for permits and rules in 
general and provide guidance in this document for application of 
the same principles to ""limitations established by rule or 
general permit,” as described in the guidance document issued 
January 25, 1995, entitled ""Options for Limiting Potential to 
Emit (PTE) of a Stationary Source under section 112 and Title V 
of the Clean Air Act (Act)."" The description is as follows: 
Limitations established by rules. For less complex plant 
sites, and for source categories involving relatively few 
operations that are similar in nature, case-by-case 
permitting may not be the most administratively efficient 
approach to establishing federally enforceable restrictions. 
One approach that has been used is to establish a general 
rule which creates federally enforceable restrictions at one 
time for many sources (these rules have been referred to as 
""prohibitory"" or ""exclusionary"" rules). The concept of 
exclusionary rules is described in detail in the November 3, 
1993 memorandum [""Approaches to Creating Federally 
Enforceable Emissions Limits,"" from John S. Seitz]. A 
specific suggested approach for VOC limits by rule was 
described in EPA’s memorandum dated October 15, 1993 
entitled ""Guidance for State Rules for Optional Federally 
Enforceable Emissions Limits Base Upon Volatile Organic 
Compound (VOC) Use."" An example of such an exclusionary rule 
is a model rule developed for use in California. (The 
California model rule is attached, along with a discussion 
of its applicability to other situations - see Attachment 
2). Exclusionary rules are included in a State's SIP or 112 
program and generally become effective upon approval by the 
EPA. 
The EPA prefers the term ""exclusionary rule"" in that this 
phrase is a less ambiguous description of the overall purpose of 
these rules. 

General permits -A concept similar to the exclusionary 
rule is the establishment Of a general permit for a given 
source type. A general permit is a single permit that 
establishes terms and conditions that must be complied with 
by all sources subject to that permit. The establishment of 
a general permit could provide for emission limitations in a 
one-time permitting process, and thus avoid the need to 
issue separate permits for each source. Although this 
concept is generally thought of as an element of Title V 
permit programs there in no reason that a state or local 
agency could not submit a general permit program as a SIP  
submittal Aimed at creating synthetic minor sources. 
Additionally FESOP [Federally Enforceable State Operating 
Permit usually reffering to Title I State OperatingPermit 
Programs approved under- the criteria established by EPA in 
the June 28, 1989 Federal Register notice, 54 FR 27274] 
programs can include general permits as an element of the 
FESOP program being approved into the SIP. The advantage of 
a SIP general permit, when compared to an exclusionary rule, 
is that upon approval by the EPA of the state's general 
permit program, a general permit could be written for an 
additional source type without triggering the need for the 
formal SIP revision process. (January 25, 1995 Seitz and  
Van Heuvelen memorandum, page 4.) 
SIP or §112 Rules 
Source-category standards 'approved in the. SIP. or under 
112,if enforceable as a. practical matter, can be used as 
federally enforceable limits on potential to emit. Such 
provisions require public participation and EPA review. Once a 
specific source qualifies under the applicability requirements of 
the source category rule, additional public participation is not 
required to make the limits federally enforceable as a matter of 
legal sufficiency since the rule itself underwent public 
participation and EPA review. The rule must still be enforceable  
as practical matter in order to be considered federally 
enforceable. A source that violates this type of rule limiting 
potential to emit below major a source thresholds or is later 
determined not to qualify for coverage under the rule, could be 
subject to enforcement action for violation of the rule and for 
constructing or operating without a proper permit (a. part 70, a 
New Source Review permit, or operating without meeting §112 
requirements, or any combination thereof). 
General Permits  
The title V regulations set out provisions for general 
permits covering numerous similar sources. The primary purpose of 
general permits is to provide a permitting alternative where 
3 

the normal permitting process would be overly burdensome, such as 
for area sources under section 112. General permits may be 
issued to cover any category of numerous similar sources, 
including major sources, provided that such sources meet certain 
criteria laid out in 40 CFR part 70. Sources may be issued 
general permits strictly for the purpose of avoiding 
classification as major source. in other words, general permits 
may be used to limit the potential to emit for numerous similar 
sources. However, general permits must also most both legal and 
practical federal enforceable requirements. 
With respect to legal sufficiency, the operating permit 
regulations provide that once the general permit has been issued, 
after opportunity for public participation and, EPA and affected 
State review, the permitting authority may grant or deny a 
sources request to be covered by a general permit without 
further public participation or EPA or affected State review. 
The action of granting or denying the source's request is not 
subject to judicial review. A general permit does not carry a 
permit shield. A source may be subject to enforcement action for 
operating without a part 70 permit if the source is later 
determined not to qualify for coverage under the general permit. 
Sources covered by general permits must comply with all part 70 
requirements. 
State SIP or 112(l) General Permits 
Another mechanism available to limit potential to emit is a 
general permit program approved into the SIP or under section 
112(1), the hazardous air pollutant program authority. This 
mechanism allows permitting authorities to issue and revise 
general permits consistent with SIP or 112(1) program 
requirements without going through the SIP or 112(1) approval 
process for each general permit or revision of a general permit.  
The program is also separate from title V, like Title I  
state operating permits, and issuance and revisions of the 
permits are to comply with title V procedures. 
Once a program is approved, issuing and revising general 
permits should be significantly less burdensome and time- 
consuming for State legislative and rulemaking authorities. The 
EPA review should also be less burdensome and time-consuming. 
After a program is approved, permitting authorities have the 
flexibility to submit and issue general permits as needed rather 
than submitting them all at once as part of a SIP submittal. 
Given the reduced procedural burden, permitting authorities 
should be able to issue general permits to small groups or 
categories or sources rather than attempt to cover broad  
categories with a generic rule. We anticipate that specific 
permit requirements or general permits may be readily developed 
with the assistance of interested industry groups. 
4 

The state general permit approach may allow sources to meet the 
federal the federal enforceability requirements more easily than 
other approaches. However, to use this approach, states must have 
a federally enforceable program that provides the state the  
authority, to issue such permits; to accomplish this, EPA must 
approve the program into the SIP or pursuant to section. 112(1) 
of the Clean Air Act. 
Enforceability Principles 
In 1989, in response to challenges from the Chemical 
Manufacturers Association and other industry groups, EPA 
reiterated its position that controls and limitations used to 
limit a source's Potential to emit must be federally enforceable. 
See 54 FR 27274 (June 28, 1989). Federally enforceable limits can 
be established by Clean Air Act programs such as NSPS, NESHAPs, 
MACTs, and SIP requirements. However, source-specific limits are 
generally set forth in permits. Generally, to be considered 
federally enforceable, the permitting program must be approved by 
EPA into the SIP and include provisions for public participation. 
""In addition, permit terms and conditions must be practicably 
enforceable to be considered federally enforceable. EPA provided 
specific guidance on federally enforceable permit conditions in a 
June 13, 1989 policy memo “Limiting Potential to Emit in New 
Source Permitting” from John Seitz and in the June 28, 1989 
Federal Register notice (54 FR 27274) Additional guidance Can 
also be found in United states v. Louisiana Pacific,682 F. Supp 
1122 (D. Colo. 1987) 682 F. Supp 1141 (D. Colo.1988), which led 
to these guidance statements and a number of other memoranda 
covering practicable enforceability as it relates to rolling 
averages, short-term averages, and emission caps. See “Use of 
Long Term Rolling Averages to Limit Potential to Emit,” form 
John. B. Rasnic to David Kee, February 24, 1992; “Limiting 
Potential to Emit;” from Mamie Miller to George Czerniak, August, 
1992; “Policy Determination an Limiting Potential to Emit for 
Koch Refining Company's Clean Fuels Project"", from John B. Rasnic 
to David Kee, March 13, 1992; and “3M Tape Manufacturing Division 
Plant, St. Paul, Minnesota” from. John B. Rasnic to David Kee, 
July 14, 1992. 
In 1987, EPA laid out enforceability criteria that SIP rules 
must meet. see “Review of State Implementation Plans and 
Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency,” from Michael 
Alushin, Alan Eckert, and John Seitz, September 3, 1987 (1997 SIP 
memo). The criteria include clear statements as to applicability, 
specificity as to the standard that must be met, explicit 
statements of the compliance time frames (e.g. hourly, daily, 
monthly, or 12-month averages, etc.), that the time frame and 
method of compliance employed must be sufficient to protect the 
standard involved, record keeping requirements must be specified, 
and equivalency provisions must meet certain requirements. 
5 

Based an these precedents this guidance describes six 
enforceability criteria which a rule or a general permit must 
meet to make limits enforceable as a practical matter. In 
general, practical enforceability for a source-specific permit 
term means that the provision must specify (1) a technically 
accurate limitation and the portions of the source subject to the 
limitation; (2) the time period for the limitation (hourly, 
daily, monthly, annually); and (3) the method to determine 
compliance including appropriate monitoring, record keeping and 
reporting. For rules and general permits that apply to categories 
of sources, practical enforceability additionally requires that 
the provision (4) identify the categories of sources that are 
covered by the rule; (5) where coverage is optional, provide for 
notice to the permitting authority of the source’s election to be 
covered by the rule; and (6) recognize the enforcement 
consequences relevant to the rule.  
This guidance will address requirements (4) ""arid (5) first as 
they are concepts that are unique to rules and general' permits. 
A. 
Specific Applicability 
Rules and general permits designed to limit potential to 
emit must be specific as to the emission units or sources covered 
by the rule or permit. In other words, the rule or permit must 
clearly identify the category(ies) of the sources that qualify 
for the rule's coverage. The rule must apply to categories of 
sources that are defined specifically or narrowly enough so that 
specific limits and compliance monitoring can be identified and 
achieved by all sources in the categories defined. 
A rule or general permit that covers, a homogeneous group of 
sources should allow standards to be set that limit potential to 
emit and provide the specific monitoring requirements. 
(Monitoring is more fully addressed in section D.) The State can 
allow for generic control efficiencies where technically sound 
and appropriate, depending on the extent of the application and 
ability to monitor compliance with resultant emission limits. 
Similarly, specific and narrow applicability may allow generic 
material usage or limits on hours of operation to be sufficient. 
For example, a rule or general permit that applies to fossil fuel 
fired boilers of a certain size may allow for limits on material 
usage, such as fuel-type and quantity. A rule or general permit 
that applies, only to standby diesel generators or emergency  
generators may allow restrictions on hours of operation to limit  
potential to emit. The necessary compliance terms (i.e., 
monitoring or record keeping) associated with any of these 
limits, such as with hours of operation, can readily be specified 
in the rule or the general permit itself. 
General permits under Title V are assumed to include this 
6 

enforceability principle because the Part 70 regulations set out 
specific criteria that states should consider in developing their 
general permit provisions (See 57 FR 32278). These factors 
include requirements that 
“categories of sources covered by general permits should be 
generally homogenous in terms of operations, processes, and 
emissions. All sources in the category should have 
essentially similar operations or processes and emit 
pollutants with similar characteristics.” 
Another factor stated is “sources should be subject to the same 
or substantially similar requirements governing operation, 
emissions, monitoring, reporting, or record keeping.” Examples of 
source categories  appropriate for general permits include: 
degreasers, dry cleaners, small heating systems, sheet fed 
printers, and VOC storage tanks (see 57 FR 32278).  
B. 
Reporting or Notice to Permitting Authority 
The rule or general permit should provide specific reporting 
requirements as part of the compliance method. Although the 
compliance method for all sources must include record keeping 
requirements, the permitting authority may make a determination 
that reporting requirements for small sources would provide 
minimal additional compliance assurance. Where ongoing reporting 
requirements are determined not to be reasonable for a category 
of sources, the rule or general permit should still provide that 
the source notify the permitting authority of its coverage by the 
rule or the permit. In the limited situation where all the 
sources described in a source category are required to comply 
with the all of the provisions of a rule or general permit, 
notice is not needed. However, where there are no reporting 
requirement’s and no opt-in provisions, the permitting authority 
must provide the public with the names and locations of sources 
subject to the rule or permit. 
For Title V general permits, Part 70 requires sources to 
submit an application for a general permit which must be approved 
or disapproved by the permitting authority. For SIP or §112 rules  
and SIP or §112 general permits, in response to receiving the 
notice or application, the permitting authority may issue an 
individual permit, or alternatively, a letter or certification. 
The permitting authority may also determine initially whether it 
will issue a response for each individual application or notice, 
and may initially specify a reasonable time period after which a 
source that has submitted an application or notice will be deemed 
to be authorized, to operate under the general permit or SIP or 
§112 rule. 
7 

C. 
Specific Technically Accurate Limits 
The rule or general permit issued pursuant to the SIP or 
§112 must specify technically accurate limits on the potential to 
emit. The rule or general permit must clearly specify the limits 
that apply, and include the specific associated compliance 
monitoring. (The compliance monitoring requirements are discussed 
further in the next section.) The standards or limits must be 
technically specific and accurate to limit potential to emit, 
identifying any allowed deviations. 
The 1987 policy on SIP enforceability states that 
limitations “must be sufficiently specific so that a source is 
fairly on notice as to the standard it must meet.” For example, 
“alternative equivalent technique” provisions should not be 
approved without clarification concerning the time period over 
which equivalency is measured as wall as whether the equivalency 
applies on a per source or per line basis or is facility-wide. 
Further, for potential to emit limitations, the standards 
set must be technically sufficient to provide assurance to EPA 
and the public that they actually represent a limitation on the 
potential to emit for the category of sources identified. Any 
presumption for control efficiency must be technically accurate 
and the rule must provide the specific parameters as enforceable 
limits to assure that the control efficiency will be met. For 
example, rules setting presumptive efficiencies for incineration 
controls applied to a specific or broad category must state the 
operating temperature limits or range, the air flow, or any other 
parameters that may affect the efficiency on which the 
presumptive efficiency is based. Similarly, material usage limits 
such as fuel limits, as stated above, require specifying the type 
of fuel and may require specifying other operating parameters. 
A rule that allows sources to submit the specific 
parameters and associated limits to be monitored may not be 
enforceable because the rule itself does not set specific 
technical limits. The submission of these voluntarily accepted 
limits on parameters or monitoring requirements would need to be 
federally enforceable. Absent a source-specific permit and 
appropriate review and public participation of the limits, such a 
rule is not consistent with the EPA's enforceability principles. 
D. 
Specific compliance Monitoring 
The rule must specify the methods to determine compliance. 
Specifically, the rule must state the monitoring requirements, 
record keeping requirements, reporting requirements, and test 
methods as appropriate for each potential to emit limitation; and 
clarity which methods are used for making a direct determination 
of compliance with the potential to emit limitations. 
8 

“Monitoring” refers to many different types of data collection, 
including continuous emission or opacity monitoring, and 
measurements of various of Parameters of process or control 
devices (e.g. temperature, pressure drop, fuel usage) and record 
keeping of parameters that been limited ,such as hours of 
operation, production levels, or raw material usage. Without a 
verifiable plantwide, verifiable emission limits must assigned to 
each unit or group of units subject to the subject to he rule or 
general permit. Where monitoring cannot be used to determine 
emissions directly, limits on appropriate operating parameters 
must be established for the units or source, and must the 
monitoring must be sufficient to yield data form the relevant 
time period that is representative of the source’s compliance 
with the standard or limit. Continuous emissions monitoring, 
especially in the case of smaller sources, is not required.  
E. 
Practicably Enforceable Averaging Times 
The averaging time for all limits must be practicably 
enforceable. In other words, the averaging time period must 
readily allow for determination of compliance. EPA policy 
expresses a preference toward short term limits, generally daily 
but not to exceed one month. However, EPA policy allows for 
rolling limits not to exceed 12 months or 365 days where the 
permitting authority finds that the limit provides an assurance 
that compliance can be readily determined and verified. See June 
13, 1989 “Guidance on Limiting Potential to Emit,"" February 24, 
1992 memorandum ""Use of Long Term Rolling Averages to Limit 
Potential to Emit” from John Rasnic to David Kee and March 13 
1992 ""Policy Determination on Limiting Potential to Emit for  
Koch Refining Company Clean Fuels Project” from John B. Rasnic to 
David Kee, stating that determinations to allow an annual rolling 
average versus a shorter term limit must be made on a case by 
case basis. Various, factors weigh in favor of allowing a long 
term rolling average, such as historically unpredictable 
emissions. Other factors may weigh in favor of shorter term 
limit, such as the inability to set interim limits during the 
first year. The permitting agency must make a determination as to 
what monitoring and averaging period is warranted for the 
particular source-category in light of how close the allowable 
emissions would be to the applicability threshold.  
F. 
Clearly Recognized Enforcement 
Violations of limits imposed by the rule or general permit 
that limit potential to emit constitute violations of major 
source requirements. In other words the source would be 
violating a “synthetic minor” requirement which may result in the 
source being treated as a major source under Titles I and V. The 
1989 Federal Register Notice provides for separate enforcement 
9 

and permitting treatment depending on whether the source 
subsequently chooses to become a major or remain minor. Thus 
violations of the rule or general permit or violation of the 
specific conditions of the rule or general permit subjects the 
source to potential enforcement under the Clean Air Act and state 
law. The operating permit rule states that not withstanding the 
shield provisions of part 70, the source subject to a general 
permit may be subject to enforcement action for operating without 
a part 70 permit if the source is later determined not to qualify  
or the conditions and terms of the general permit. Moreover, 
violation of any of the conditions of the rule or general permit 
may result in a different determination of the source’s potential  
to emit and thus may subject the source to major requirements and 
to enforcement action for failure to comply with major source 
requirements from the initial determination. 
G. 
Rule Requirements for State General Permit Programs 
As discussed above, general permit programs must be 
submitted to EPA for approval under SIP authority or under 
section 112(1), or both, depending on its particular pollutant 
application. SIP and §112(1) approval and rulemaking procedures 
must be met, including public notice and comment. The specific 
application of the enforceability principles for establishing 
State SIP or §112(1) general permit programs require that the 
rule establishing the program set out these principles as rule 
requirements. In other words, these principles must be specific 
rule requirements to be met by each general permit. 
The rule establishing the program must require that 
(1)general permits apply to a specific and narrow category of 
sources; (2) sources electing coverage under general permits 
where coverage is not mandatory, provide notice or reporting to 
the permitting authority; (3) general permits provide specific  
and technically accurate(verifiable) limits that restrict the 
potential to emit; (4) general permits contain specific 
compliance requirements; (5) Limits in general permits are 
established based on practicably enforceable averaging times; and 
(6) violations of the permit are considered violations of the 
state and federal requirements and result in the source being 
subject to major source requirements. 
In addition, since the rule establishing the program does 
not provide the specific standards to be met by the source, each 
general permit, but not each application under each general 
permit, must be issued pursuant to public and EPA notice and 
comment. The 1989 Federal Register notice covering enforceability 
of operating permits requires that SIP operating permit programs 
issue permits pursuant to public and EPA notice and comment. 
Title V requires that permits, including general permits, be 
issued subject to EPA objection. 
10 

Finally, sources remain liable or compliance with major source 
requirements if the specific application of a general permit to 
the source does not limit the source's potential to emit below 
major source or major modification thresholds. (The limits 
provided in these mechanisms may actually limit the potential to 
emit of sources but may not limit the potential to emit for some 
sources to below the threshold necessary to avoid major source 
requirements. For example, a general permit for industrial 
boilers may in fact provide limits that are sufficient to bring a 
source with only two or three boilers to below the subject 
thresholds but a source with more than three boilers may have a 
limited PTE but not limited below the major source threshold.) 
Also, where the source is required to use another mechanism to 
limit potential to emit, i.e., a construction permit, the general 
permit may not be relied upon by the source or the State, to 
limit potential to emit. 
Permits issued pursuant to the approved program, meeting the 
above requirements, are adequate to provide federally enforceable 
limits on potential to emit for New Source Review, title V, and  
§112 programs as long as they are approved pursuant to SIP 
(section 110) and section 112(1) authorities.

Dear Mr. Eden:
At the conclusion of our meeting on July 23. 2007. the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) agreed to provide the State with a thorough listing of
clarifications that would be needed for Federal approval of Texas' Flexible Permit rules.
We appreciate your letter of August 30, 2007, providing information about the Flexible
Permit program. The two purposes of this letter are to transmit EPA's comments oil the
measures necessary for Federal approvalof the Flexible Permit rules and to request a
response as to whether the Texas Commission on Environmental,Quality (TCEQ) will
recommend adoption of those measures. The EPA also notified all Flexible Permit
holders of our concerns by letter dated September 25. 2007.
, The enclosed analysis includes the comments from all 'EPA offices with review
responsibilities. We would appreciate knowing whether all rule revisions and
clarifications are acceptable by the end of March. If TCEQ commits to propose the
necessary revisions to the Flexible Permit program, we request that TCEQ work with
EPA in partnership to share draft revisions .of the Flexible Permit rules during the rule,
development process. If the revised regulations address our concerns, we believe we
could propose approval of the Texas Flexible Permit program.
We are willing to meet with you and members of your staffto discuss the
necessary revisions and recommendations detailed in the enclosure. Should new facts or
information become available during OUf discussions of the revisions, we will attempt to
work with TCEQ to reach a mutual decision about whether the-revisions. or any other
additional revisions identifiedduring our discussions, are necessary for the proposed

We understand that the aim of theTexas FlexiblePermitProgramis to establish an
aggregated Best AvailableControlTechnology emission limit for a groupof individual
facilitieswithina stationary source, Thiswouldenablean owneror operator of the
source to operatethosefacilities withless technical and administrative.effortthanwould
be requiredunder air permits which impose unit-specific massemissionlimits. Wehave
reviewedtheseprovisions of yourrulefor consistency with40 Codeof Federal
Regulations (CFR) Part 51~ We haveidentifiedconcerns related to public participation
and air qualityanalysis for initialissuance andmodifications whichincreasethesite wide

We identifiedconcerns relatedto applicability of yourmajorNSR programrequirements

RULE REVISIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS
1.
Establishing the FlexiblePermitEmission Cap.
A.
..Addition of 9% of totalemissions to the FlexiblePermit emission cap
Delete Section 116.716(d)1 from SubchapterG. As submitted, therules
are unclear as to whetheradjustments to the emissionscap or individual
emission limitationby an ""insignificantemissions factor""could causeor
contribute to a violation of a NAAQS or, perhaps, triggermajorNSR
requirements.
B.
Best AvailableControlTechnology (BACT)Determinations
1.
. ReviseSection 116.711(3) to indicate that currentBACT
·technologywillbe required. consistent with Section 116.716(a)(1).
·For example,
(3) Best available control technology(BACT). The
proposedfacility, groupof facilities, or accountwill utilize
currentBACT,withconsiderationgiven to the technical
practicability andeconomicreasonableness of reducingor
eliminatirig the emissionsfrom the facilityon a proposed
facility, groupof facilities, or account basis.
2.
Revise Section 116.716 to requirethat any BACT or lowest
achievable emission rate (LAER)control technologyand the
related massemissionrates in majorNSR permits which are
incorporated into the FlexiblePermit remain enforceableand shall
·be retainedor appropriately streamlinedthrough a SIP-approved
. NSR permitrevision processas described below.
3.
Are BACTdeterminations underSection 116.716requiredto be
based on the Stateor Federaldefinition? Please clarify the
definitionof BACTand whichdefinition applies (i.e.,whenis a
source requiredto use the State definition versusthe Federal
definition.....PSD, minorNSR,etc.).
I Section 116.716 (d) states:
Insignificant emission factor. The emission caps and individual emissions limitation
calculated pursuant to this section may include an Insignificant Emissions Factor which
does not exceed 9.0% of the total emission cap or individual emission limitation.

C.
Emission Limitations
1.
Add a provision to SubchapterG to state that a FlexiblePermitwill
. 'contain, at a minimum, an annualemission limitationin tonsper
year, based on a 12~month rolling average (or other timeperiod
that is at leastas stringent) that is enforceable as a practical matter
for each pollutant regulatedunder the FlexiblePermit-. Revise
Section 116.715(c)(6),2Recordkeeping, to clarifythat emission cap
.and individual emissionlimitationcalculationsshall,be based, at a
minimum, on a 12-month rolling basis (or other timeperiodthatis
.at least as stringent) that is enforceable as a practical matterfor
eachpollutantat the source. The rule should alsobe written broad
enough to require more stringentlimitation periodswhennecessary
. (e.g., duringthe ozoneseason).
.
2.'
.. Add a provision to Section 116.715(c)(6)to state that a Flexible
Permit will includea short-termemission Iimitationcap(or other
reasonable cap or reasonable time period withmonitoringand
recordkeeping thatensurespractical enforceability)for each
pollutant regulated underthe Flexible Permit that is enforceable as
a practicalmatter. See NumberI under Implementation Issues for
further information concerningpractical enforceability.
3.
Add a provision to Section116.715that emissioncalculations for
purposes ofcompliance withemission caps include emissions
resulting frommaintenance,startup, and shutdown (MSS).3
4.
.Please explainhowTCEQ will ensure that emissionlimitations
adopted pursuantto 40 CFR 52.21(r)(4), incorporatedintothe
Texas SIP at Section116.160(a), will not berelaxed by the
Flexible Permitprocess.
2 For example, Section 116.715(c)(6), thethirdsentencecould be revisedas follows: This
.informationshall include, but is not limitedto, emission cap and individual emission limitationcalculations
basedon a 12-monthrolling basis and production recordsand operation hours.
3 For EPA's policy on compliancewithSlP emissionlimitations during periods of maintenance,
see Policy on Excess Emissions duringStartup,Shutdown, Maintenance and Malfunction,from
KathleenBennett to Regional Administrators, February15, 1983: ""... scheduled maintenance is a
predictableevent which can be scheduledat the discretion of the operator, and whichcan, therefore, be .
made to coincide with maintenanceon excessemissions duringperiods of scheduled maintenance should
be·treated as a violation unless a sourcecan demonstrate that such emissions could have been avoided
throughbetter scheduling for maintenanceor through betteroperation and maintenancepractice.""

II.
Identification of modifications authorized by Section 116.718, Significant
Emission Increase4 and Major NSR applicability.
.
, . '. The rule is vagu.eas to what modifications are authorized by Subchapter G.
Section 116.710 states: A person may obtain a flexible permit which allows for
physical or operational changes as provided by this subchapter as an alternative to
. obtaining a new source review permitunder §116.110 of this title (relating to
Applicability), or in lieu of amending an existing permit under §116.116 of this
title (relating to Amendments and Alterations). Section 116;718 grants an
.exemption from ""state new source review"" for operational or physical changes
which result in an emission increase. ""State new SOUrce review"" is not defined.
. Section 116.711 requires sources to demonstrate compliance with majorNSR
.requirements at the time of initial issuance or amendment. However, the rule
does not require such a demonstration for modifications that are authorized by
Subchapter G. The following changes are intended to ensure that a major new
, stationary source or a significant increase in emissions from a major stationary
source is reviewedto ensure compliance with theperrriitting requirements
applicable for such projects.
A.
·Revise Section 116.718 or provide a definition of ""state new source
review."" Such definition must exclude authorization of modifications, or a
series of modifications, which trigger major NSR applicability. The rule
should note that the Flexible Permit does notauthorize projects to'be
segregated into smaller projects which are physically or economically
.. dependent on one another in order to avoid majorNSR applicability.
Include a provision in Section 116)10, Applicability, to clarify the scope
of the rule, such as: Any facility or group of facilities; which constitutes a
new major stationary source or a major modification as defined under the
applicable permitting requirements of Chapter 116, Subchapter B,
Division 5 or Division 6 of this title (relating to Nonattainment Review
and Prevention of Significant Deterioration Review) must meet the
applicable permitting requirements of Chapter 116. Subchapter B,
Division 5 or Division 6.
C.
Revise Section 116.711 to provide that any application for an initial
flexible permit or for an amendment to a flexible permit must include all
information (including calculations) which demonstrates thatthe proposed
project willnot be a major stationary source or major modification as used
4 Section 116.718 states: An increase in emissions from operational or physical changes at an
existing facility covered by a flexible permit is insignificant, for the purposes of State new source review'
under this subchapter. if the increase does not exceed either the emission cap or individual emission
limitation. This section does not apply to an increase in emissions from a new facility nor to the emission
of an air contaminant not previously emitted by an existing facility. .

Revise Section 116.711(13) torequire the permitteeto comply withany
representations in the permitapplication of the underlyingpermitsthat are
incorporatedinto the.Flexiblepermit (asrequiredunder §116.116(a)(1) in
the approvedSIP)""unless thoserequirements arespecificallyamended by .
.the permittingprocessas described below. ReviseSubchapterG to clarify
.that authorization of futurechangesunder the FlexiblePermit may not
include changes subjectto majorNSR unless the permit undergoes the
major NSR processand is incorporated into the amendedFlexible Permit.
III.
Removalof terms and conditionsof existingpermits.
The permit application and the.State's preliminaryanalysis.including the air
quality analysis, must ensure that all terms andconditionsof existing permits
remainenforceableunless such termsand conditionsare supersededor subsumed
by the flexiblepermit conditionsthroughproper streamliningproceduresas
describedbelow. Texas shouldreviseSection 116.711(13), Applicationcontent,
to require the permitteeto identifytermsand conditionsIincluding representations
in permit applications)in existingpermitswhich will be supersededor subsumed
underthe Flexible Permit. Furthermore, any such term or condition of an existing
permit (includingrepresentations in the applications)whichwill be supersededor
subsumed by the flexible permitmust be accompaniedwith a demonstration that.
the revision will not violateapplicableportionsofthe control strategy and willnot
interfere with attainment or maintenance of the ambientair quality standardsas

'Section 117.721(d) allows Flexible Permit holders to obtain

'categories of emission sources, such as a storage tank. We
recognize that these PBRs may be appropriate for Flexible
Permit holders where the new emission source does not
cause an exceedance of the emission cap(s). However,
EPA has consistently expressed concerns about PBRs that

The EPA also has concerns about how modifications
authorized under a Flexible Permit at sources subject to
Title V are incorporated into a'Federal Operating Permit
(FOP). Please explain how the FOP is amended to
incorporate modifications authorized by a Flexible Permit
and whether further public participation is required to
amend the FOP.
V.
Monitoring, Recordkeeping, Reporting and Testing (MRRT) ,
A.
Monitoring
The monitoring requirements in the Subchapter G~ Section 116.715(5) are
vague. Revise this provision to require each flexible permit to contain
specific requirements for monitoring compliance with the emission cap
and with individual emission limits. Provide guidance on appropriate

9
monitoring for individual units under the Flexible Permit. See further
discussion of minimum MRRTrequirements on page 10-12.
B.
Recordkeeping
Revise Section 116.715(a)(6) recordkeeping to require retention of
· compliance records for five years and to require' a copy of the Flexible
· Permit application, amendments, and any permit application incorporated
by reference into the Flexible Permit to be maintained at the site. See
· further discussion of minimum MRRT requirements on page 10-:12..
VI.
. We recommend revision of Section 116.715 to state that an exceedance of the
Flexible Permit cap is a violation of the permit. subject to enforcement action and,
for major sources, reportable as an FOP deviation. To ensure practical
enforceability of the permit and consistency with 40 CPR 51.211 and 51.212, we
strongly recommend that the State require semi-annual reporting of exceedances
of the Flexible Permit cap.
.
VII.
.Major NSR Netting.
Because all units at a site may not be subject to a Flexible Permit and because all
.. units under the Flexible Permit may not have a unit specific emission limitation,
. the rule should contain provisions on how to conduct major NSR netting at the
.site for units in the Flexible Permit and for units outside the Flexible Permit.
... Revise the rule to provide requirements for major sourcessubject to major NSR
netting to determine the net emissions increase under Subchapter B with the
following minimum considerations for Flexible Permits:
A.
Emission increases and decreases must be considered on a site wide basis
under a site wide or partial Flexible Permit,
B.
Emission increases resulting from a physical change or change in the
method of operation of any emission unit which were authorized by the
Flexible Permit must be considered where the unit's projected actual
emissions exceed the baseline actual emission tate.
C.
A decrease in emissions at a unit under the Flexible Perinit is creditable if
the unit's baseline actual emissions exceedthe unit's new level of
emissions, meets all the criteria of 40 CPR 51.165(l)(I)(vi) and
51.166(b)(3), and the decrease is made practically enforceable by
·permanently removing the unit from the Flexible Permit cap and
.establishing a new enforceable unit specitlc emission limitation.
,
·i
!!

10
D.
The Flexible Permit cap mustbe adjusteddownward by the amount of that
unit's contribution to thecap.
.
VITI.
Air QualityAnalysis.
..ReviseSection 116.711(10) torequire an air qualityanalysis for Initial issuanceof
all FlexiblePermits or amendments whichincrease theFlexiblePermit cap to
ensurethat theproposed flexiblepermits willnot violate the approved control
strategyand willnotinterferewithattainment and maintenance.of the NAAQS (as
required under40CPR51.160(a») or thePSD increments (under40 CPR
51.166(a» .
. IX.
Maintenance, Startup, and Shutdown (MSS)emissions.
The potential.to emitshouldincludeemissionsthat occurduringmaintenance7, .
. startups,and shutdowns (MSS). The MSS emissions shouldbe subjectto BACT,
and reviewedin the air qualityanalysis for all emissionunitsunderthe Flexible
Permit. Revise. Section 116.711, FlexiblePermitApplication, to require.
informationrelated to startup,shutdown and maintenance emissions, including
adequatemonitoring and recordkeeping. We understand thatTexas is
incorporating theseemissions into permits, includingexistingFlexiblePermits. .
We recommend thatnew FlexiblePermitsincludea reviewof MSS emissions and
include. appropriate monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
X"",
Implementation Schedulefor Additional Controls.
We understandthat TCEQprovidesan implementation schedulefor Flexible
Permit holdersto installcontroltechnology requiredbythe permit. The schedule
""may be up to 10 years. Section 116.717 states: .
If a facilityrequires the installationof additional controlsto meet an

We recommend that TCEQ delete this italicized phrase and insert new regulatory
language to require a permit amendment for sources' that fail to install control
equipment required by the permit, Please confirm that failure to install control
equipment required by the Flexible Permit would be a violation of the permit.
Please confirm that BACT/LAER control technology that is required under major
NSR must be operational at start of operation and is not subject to this
implementation schedule.

XI.
Other Suggested Changes.
A.
§116.711(2) - provides for measuring the,emissions of air contaminants
""as determined by the director:' Texas should revise this provision to
establish a replicable standard rather than granting discretion to the
director - e.g., ""measurement and frequency sufficient to demonstrate
on-going compliance with specified emission limitations.""
B.
§116.716(a)(1) - Define the term ""maximum expected capacity.""
C.
§1l6.715(b}-Define the term ""multiple emissions cap.""
D.
§116.716(c) - The rule is vague concerning how the emission cap will be .
adjusted for the addition of new facilities. Texas should amend'the permit
to adjust the cap for new facilities. Texas' rules should be clear on the
process.
E.
, §116.721(c)(l) - Texas needs to add an additional exception ""or conflicts
with an existing permit limit."" There may be permit limits expressed as
throughput limits or feedstock requirements and this paragraph appears to
authorize changes in a source's obligations to comply with those terms
without a permit amendment or alteration.

Whatis practical enforceability?

However.where EPAhas established emissionlimitatioris for largegroups
of emissionssources subjectto a site widecap, additional requirements
were considered toensurepractical enforceability. Forexample, the

limitation(s), setsminimum requirements for :MR.RT in return for

units. Becauseemissions unitscan varyin size and type or operation as
wellas having widely different regulatory, monitoring,and compliance
requirements', EPA has serious concerns thatsuch a short-term limitcanbe
. .practically enforced. Anapprovable Flexible Permit Programmust:
1.
.Set minimumreplicable standards for MRRT equivalent to the
PAL rule or demonstrate howMRRTin the revisedFlexible
Permitrule is at leastas stringent as those requirements.
2.
.Address howthenumberof unitsandthe potentialto emit(PTE)
of uriits subjectto a singleemission limitationundera cap is .
,reasonable andpractically enforceable. The revisedFlexible
. Permit rule (andguidance) shouldaddresshow this determination
., is made. One approach wouldbe to adoptemissionlimitation
sub-capsfor relatedgroups of unitsthat are ventedto a common
, controldeviceor wherea group of similaremission units have
.common operations, monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting and
testing. Another approach is to require more effectiveMRRT
, requirements for significant emission units that have the potential
to emit pollutants in amounts in excessof thresholdlevels. For
example,units withJ;>TE greaterthanmajor source thresholds
would requiremorestringent MRRTthan sources withPTE
greater thanmajorNSRsignificantthresholds, but lessthanmajor
sourcethresholds.
3.
Demonstrate thatrequiredcontrol technology achieves the level of
emissionsreductions required underthe applicableBACTor
LAER requirements. :MRRT of pollution.control equipment must
be sufficientto determine compliance with the mass emission unit
or work practice requirements adopted in conjunctionwithBACT
.or LAER. TheMRRTshouldalsodemonstrate that the capacity
range demonstrated to achieve BACTor LAER for the control
. device was not exceeded (absent a monitoringsystem
demonstrating compliance withBACf or LAER at that level).

RE:
Co111.1.TI.ents on Proposed Amenchnents to Chapter 106, 116 for Maintenance, Startup and
Shutdown (MSS) Chapter 106, SubehapterK
· Dear Mr. Hyde:
The U.S. Environmental Protection-Agency (EPA), Region 6 appreciates the opportunity
to comment on the above proposed amendments to Chapter 106 and Chapter q6 to
accommodate a Permit by Rule.and Standard Permit for MSS Emissions as part of the New
Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of SignificantDeterioration (PSD) permitting program in
·Texas. It is EPA's policy that all potential to emit (PTE) emissions, including quantifiable MSS,
be included in both NSRand PSD applicability determinations and air quality permits. We are .
aware that Texas Commission ofEnvironmental Quality(TCEQ) has a plan to permit all MSS
emissions for major sources in Texas. We understand that the inclusion of MSS in the 'air
permittingprogram will not only give TCEQ a better accounting basis forthe emissions
inventory, but will also demand accountability from its permitted facilities, especially those in .
·the non-attainment areas.
.
EPA pclicyand.guidaneeallows Permit by Rule (paR) and Standard Permits(SP) as .
exemptions from-applicable-permitting requirements for minorsources or insignificant.emission
.increases. The EPArecognizes' thatTCEQ has several PBR and S~ for minor new source review
(NSR) permits, The EPA-recognizes tharpermitting authorities may develop aPBRorstandln'd
NSR permit fora category.of emissionsunits.or stationary sources that are similar;in nature, ..
have substantially similar emissions, andwould be subject to the same or substantially similar
.. requirements governing operations~.,~~~ii.~~i9n~,monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping.
.
.
""Similarin nature"" may refer to size;processes, and operating conditions.
However, the .PBR
and·SP for MSS Can be used by anysourc~JQi any activity by meeting the specific criteria and
limits in the permit. OUf comments below a.J:'e specific to the PBR and SP for MSS.

1. Since the PBR and SP can be used by any source for any activity, for the record
:;;please explain how this is consistent with 40 Code of Federal Regulations Subpart
"".;0 that the State must provide a demonstration of the relationship between the
'production and emission related limitschosen for the rule and the air quality
modeling showing that theruleis protective of-the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards. Region 6isconcemed aboutcumulative impactsfrom numerous
""PBRs and SPs at major sources. Please provide locations and estimates of
numbers of Sources that will be subject to PBR,s, SP and individual
'iauthorizations necessary for EPA to determine whether the State Implementation
-Plan (SIP) revisions are consistent with § 110(0 of the Act.
2.
The EPA recognizes that-the conditions in the PBR andSl"" are restrictive based
on pollutant concentration determinations. The EPA is requesting that TCEQ
provides examples where major sources may use the PBR and SP for predictable,
, planned MSS activities and a-technicalanalyses that it meets the EPA approval of
the existing SIP Chapter 106 rules (68 Federal Register (FR) 64543). Section
106.1 providesthatoruycertaintypesoffacilities.or-changes-withinfacilitiea
which do.notmake.significantcontributionof·air,contaminants:tothe'atmosphere
are eligible foraPBRThis satisfies the requirements'of 40 CFR 51. 160(a) which
provides thattheSIPmust Include- procedures thatenablethe permitting authority
to determine whether the construction or modificationwillresult in a violation of
applicable portions of the control strategy or interfere with attainment or
maintenance of an NAAQS. .
'
3. '40 CFR 51.166 (a)(3) and (4) requires thatthe permitting agency must ensure that
increments are not exceeded even for the minor NSR program. For the record,
TCEQ should indicate the-number of sources or potential emissions expected
,from such sources for the PBRand SP.
4.
The PBR doesnotrequire ..notification to the agency priorto coverage or even
after they used. .Therule only requires sources to rollin these authorizations at
permitrenewals or after a two year period.. The PBR therefore-doesnot-have
practical enforceability for emission limits or.forthe number of events that a PBR
was utilized.
.
5.
The PBR and SP should have sufficient monitoring and recordkeeping to meetthe
limits in 106.4(a) 11. The rule should be clarified such that the cumulative
,J

emissions of the PBR and SP not exceed the' major and significant emission
levels. ,The PBR and SP should have provisions for notification to the Agency
whenever the conditions containedin the rule have been exceeded or otherwise
violated.
7. The PBR and SP allow facilities to preconstruct (temporary facilities) prior to the
agency's review. The rule should provide TCEQ the opportunity to evaluate the'
MSS PBR and SP for major sources or for sources that already have MSS in the
permitto determine activities that should have been appropriately aggregated so
as not to circumvent the PSD/Nonattainment New Source.Review (NNSR)
regulations.
""
,
'8. The rule should require-some type of affirmative action by the State on'
notification bythe permittee- ata.minimum.a written record of acknowledgment
, of receipt of-thenotification-and-datecoverage began and the rule must allow the
State to deny coverage at-any.time.for cause. The EPA's final rulemaking (71 FR
14439, March 22,2006) conditionally approving Missouri PBR provisions stated
that the rule did not clearly authorize Missouri to prevent construction or
modification where necessary. Please clarify how TCEQ will be able to track
sources operating under this PBR:
9.
The.EPA has historically approved ""prohibitory"" or ""exclusionary"" rules such as
PBR or general permittingrules (SP) where the primary purpose is to provide
practically enforceable PTE Iimits.to avoid Federal requirements applicable to
major sources andlor to streamline permitting processes for ""numerous similar
sources"" where the quantity ofemissions is insignificant. The MSS SP requires
the facilities in the application toindicate specific emission limits similar to a
site-specific permit-in-additionto.having site specific MSS emissions in a
PSDINNSRpermit. It is not clear that these emissions meet the ""exemptions"" of
the Texas Clean Air Act 382.057.
'
'
10. 106.(4)(a) 2 refers to netting bymajor sources. Please clarify if major sources are
allowed to use nettingto qualifyfor a PBRandlorSP and how the netting ""
decreases are made practically enforceable.
11. Section 116.10(11)E also refers to net emission increases. Please indicate how
this meets current PSD requirements. The EPA has provided comments regarding ,
this concern in a letter dated September 15, 2006, from David Neleigh to Steve
H~gle.
'
'12. 106.268(c) refers, to ""production emissions"". Please identify where this term has
, been defined in Chapter i06.

13. We request further clarification of TCEQ's authority to deny.or revoke a
registration for a PBR or SP for cause.
14. We encourage.that TCEQ evaluate all previous comments from EPA and the
public regarding the PBR and SP for MSS submitted in'early 2006.2
.
Once again, EPA Region 6 commends TCEQ on taking the initiative for-permitting of all
MSS emissions, which provides mechanisms to monitor air quality that will safeguard the health
. and the environment for all Texans. If you have any questions regarding the above comments,

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ, cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
By the way,
our native coal is highly sulpherized --- meaning, it's
WAAAAY dirty!
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ1s illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
Sincerely,

Strong regulations are vital to cleaning up the energy industry and

Dear Ms. Perez Jackson, 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken. 
I 
applaud EPA1s proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ 
air 
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and 
should be 
thrown out. 
That was a good first step. Now is the time for the EPA to 
take bold 
action by: 
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by 
TCEQ 
utilizing TCEQ1s current illegal policy 
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired 
power 
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating 
under the 
Federal Clean Air Act standards 
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants - -  
no 
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing 
all 
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and 
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in 
accordance 
with the Federal Clean Air Act. 
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming 
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow 
existing 
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions. 

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants 
than any 
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on 
the top 
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past 
five 
years. Texans deserve better. We cannot let coal stand in the

Texas is making a sincere attempt at going green and is trying to
develop its solar and wind capabilities.  Coal should not continue to
be given an unfair edge in this competition.  The health of Texas
citizens should not be put at further risk by allowing more coal to be
burned and the toxic pollution to be released in our midst.  No more

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all

CHAPTER 5:  WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE 
 
5.1  QUANTITATIVE CORROBORATIVE ANALYSIS 
5.1.1  Introduction 
The corroborative analysis presented in this chapter demonstrates the progress that the Houston-
Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area is making towards attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 0.08 parts per million (ppm).  The United States 
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) April 2007 “Guidance on the Use of Models and Other 
Analyses for Demonstrating Attainment of Air Quality Goals for Ozone, PM2.5, and Regional Haze” 
(EPA, 2007) states that all model attainment demonstrations should include supplemental evidence that 
the conclusions derived from the basic attainment modeling are supported by other independent sources 
of information.  This document will present the supplemental evidence, i.e., the corroborative analyses, 
for the current modeling demonstration.  The guidance also states that a weight of evidence demonstration 
is allowed when the future design value is at or below 87.9 parts per billion (ppb). 
 
The first section of the quantitative corroborative analysis will discuss photochemical grid modeling.  
Modeling is one of the most important tools available for evaluating progress toward meeting air quality 
standards, but it is not a perfect tool.  The first section will also discuss known issues with photochemical 
grid modeling and how the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has dealt with them.  It 
also discusses overall model performance.  Finally, it discusses the diagnostic analyses performed by the 
TCEQ, and the implications of those analyses on the projected attainment status.  The second section of 
the quantitative corroborative analysis will discuss trends in ozone and ozone precursors observed in the 
HGB area, and examines the possible causes for those trends.  The third section describes air quality 
control measures that cannot yet be adequately quantified but are nonetheless expected to yield tangible 
air quality benefits.  
 
5.2  Corroborative Analysis:  Modeling 
Photochemical grid modeling of the HGB area is challenging, due to complex coastal wind circulation, 
complex petrochemical point sources of emissions in Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, and Harris 
Counties, and the challenges associated with modeling a metropolitan area of over five million 
inhabitants.   
 
One purpose of the Texas Air Quality Study 2000 (TexAQS 2000) and the Texas Air Quality Study 2006 
(TexAQS II) field studies was to address the uncertainties that affect photochemical grid modeling and 
their regulatory applications.  Insights gleaned from the TexAQS 2000 and subsequent studies have 
helped resolve some of these uncertainties.   
 
Several studies have tried to identify and reduce uncertainties in the HGB photochemical grid modeling.  
Foremost among these efforts are the studies that have sought to quantify underreported industrial highly 
reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) emissions (Wert et al., 2003; Xie and Berkowitz, 2007; 
Yarwood et al., 2004; TCEQ, 2002, 2004, 2006; Smith and Jarvie, 2008) and to assess the sensitivities of 
ozone simulations to underreporting these emissions (TCEQ, 2002, 2004, 2006; Byun et al., 2007; Jiang 
and Fast, 2004).  Other modeling efforts have tested different chemical mechanisms in the HGB area’s 
photochemical grid modeling, to study the effects of using different mechanisms on ozone model 
performance and control strategy effectiveness (Byun et al., 2005b; Faraji et al., 2008; Czader et al., 
2008).  Modeling sensitivity studies have also been performed to guide selection of model parameters 
such as vertical mixing schemes, number and depth of model layers, and horizontal grid resolution 
(Kemball-Cook et al., 2005; Byun et al., 2005b; Byun et al., 2007; Bao et al., 2005).   
 
 
 

 
 
5-2
Some of the most important findings of these studies include the following. 
 
• 
Emissions inventories must be reconciled to some extent with observational data before the 
model can accurately depict the ozone formation processes in the HGB area, especially for 
HRVOC. 
• 
Adding HRVOC to modeling emissions inventories generally increases ozone concentrations and 
alleviates a portion of the ozone and HRVOC under-prediction problems found by every 
modeling group who has attempted to model the HGB area. 
• 
Reactivities of the TCEQ-defined HRVOC are high regardless of which chemical mechanism is 
used to evaluate their effects.  In addition to the TCEQ list of HRVOC, formaldehyde also 
displays high reactivity. 
 
Mesoscale meteorological modeling is used to drive photochemical grid models, and many studies have 
examined and reduced uncertainties in these models as well.  One of the most successful efforts improved 
meteorological simulations of ozone episodes by using radar profiler and other upper level wind data to 
“nudge” the meteorological modeling (Nielsen-Gammon et al., 2007; Zhang et al. 2007; Stuart et al., 
2007; Bao et al., 2005; Fast et al., 2006).  Other efforts improved land cover data and land surface 
modeling (Byun et al., 2005a; Cheng et al., 2008a, 2008b) and studied the sensitivity of ozone simulations 
to solar irradiance and photolysis rates (Zamora et al., 2005; Fast et al., 2006; Pour-Biazar et al., 2007; 
Byun et al., 2007; Koo et al., 2008). 
 
Some of the most important findings of these meteorological modeling studies include the following. 
 
• 
Assimilation of radar profiler and other upper air wind data is essential to good meteorological 
modeling performance in the HGB area. 
• 
Modeling parameterizations need to be chosen carefully to alleviate the common problem of 
spurious thunderstorms and clouds. 
• 
Accurate simulation of cloud cover is crucial to getting photolysis rates correct in the 
photochemical grid model, and ozone predictions are very sensitive to photolysis rates. 
• 
An ensemble approach to meteorological and photochemical grid modeling may be warranted, 
given the sensitivity of ozone modeling to relatively small changes in meteorology.  The 
ensemble approach will allow probabilistic attainment demonstrations to be produced. 
 
In the remainder of this section, modeling issues identified by the studies described above will be 
discussed, as well as issues raised by TexAQS 2000 research, by TexAQS II research, and by TCEQ-
sponsored investigations.  Overall performance of the photochemical grid modeling and the implications 
of the model’s ability to accurately simulate ozone episodes will also be discussed.  Finally, additional 
metrics that show the effects of the proposed control strategies on ozone in the HGB area will be 
presented. 
 
5.2.1  Solving Modeling Problems 
For the HGB area, there are several aspects of ozone modeling that require special attention, due to their 
role in current or historical shortcomings in model performance.  This section discusses some of these 
issues, and how TCEQ has attempted to resolve them in this round of modeling. 
 
5.2.1.1  Industrial Point Source Emission Inventory Issues  
High concentrations of light alkenes such as propylene, ethylene, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes have been 
observed in the HGB metropolitan area, and are closely associated with petrochemical industry facilities 
in eastern Harris, Galveston, Chambers, and Brazoria Counties (Ryerson et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2003; 
Daum et al., 2004; Berkowitz et al., 2004; Berkowitz et al., 2005; Kleinman et al., 2002; Kleinman et al., 
2005; Jobson et al., 2004; Karl et al., 2003; Buzcu and Fraser, 2006; Xie and Berkowitz, 2006, 2007; Kim 
et al., 2005).  These compounds have been identified as highly reactive, and they play a major role in 
forming the highest concentrations of ozone observed in the HGB area (Ryerson et al., 2003; Daum et al., 
2003, 2004; Kleinman et al., 2002, 2005; Wert et al., 2003; Czader et al., 2008).  Historical analyses of 
routinely collected volatile organic compounds (VOC) data indicate that these compounds are present in 

 
 
5-3
high concentrations on a routine basis in the HGB area (Hafner Main et al., 2001; Estes et al., 2002; 
Brown and Hafner Main, 2002; Brown et al., 2002; Hafner and Brown, 2003; Jolly et al., 2003; Fang and 
McDowell, 2003; Jolly, 2003; Kim et al., 2005; Buzcu and Fraser, 2006; Xie and Berkowitz, 2006, 2007).  
Consequently, the high HRVOC concentrations observed during the two field study periods in 2000 and 
2006 are not anomalously large, and the conclusions drawn from those data should be generally 
applicable to the HGB area.  
 
Both field studies sponsored by the TCEQ, TexAQS 2000 and TexAQS II, have indicated that there are 
substantial discrepancies in the reported emissions of HRVOC, especially ethene and propylene (Ryerson 
et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2004; Wert et al., 2003; Gilman et al., 2009; de Gouw et al., 
2009).  The TCEQ remote sensing studies of flares, storage tanks, cooling towers, and other sources have 
shown that large quantities of VOC emissions have gone unreported (Robinson et al., 2008; Smylie et al., 
2004).  In addition, solar occultation flux measurements have shown that 30-minute variations in 
industrial HRVOC emissions can be an order of magnitude or more (Mellqvist et al., 2007, 2008).   
 
In an attempt to better quantify underreported HRVOC for purposes of photochemical grid modeling, the 
TCEQ commissioned a study by researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Xie and 
Berkowitz, 2006, 2007).  The researchers used historical HRVOC measurements from the extensive 
automated gas chromatograph network currently in place in the industrial areas of the HGB area.  Most of 
the sites in this network went into operation during 2003.  Using trajectories to link the source areas to the 
observations, the researchers were able to estimate which areas had the greatest emissions relative to other 
areas.   
 
For the current round of modeling, TCEQ researchers extended the methods developed by Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory to quantitatively estimate underreported HRVOC emissions in the HGB 
area.  The Potential Source Contribution Function method has measurably improved model performance 
for ozone and its precursors by reconciling the industrial point source emissions inventory with observed 
HRVOC concentrations during 2005-2006 (Smith and Jarvie, 2008).  This method does not attempt to 
reproduce the temporal variations in emissions, but instead calculates a median rate of emission for each 
square kilometer of the HGB area.  Since two years of data are used to estimate the medians, the metric is 
statistically robust.   
 
5.2.1.2  Modeling of Emissions Events 
Attempts have been made to quantify temporal variations in industrial point source emissions by 
accessing emission event reports that are delivered by industry to the TCEQ (Murphy and Allen, 2005).  
Problems with the event report data include the following. 
 
• 
Emission events were self-reported by industry, and the quantities of emissions reported were not 
independently observed or verified.  Facilities are allowed, by rule, to estimate emissions during 
emergency releases due to safety concerns. 
• 
Emission events were only reported if estimated emissions were greater than a certain threshold 
above the permitted emission level.  Some facilities have very large permitted emissions levels, and 
therefore large fluctuations in emissions may occur under an authorized emission rate that are not 
included in the data set.  Consequently, the frequency and magnitude of emission events in this data 
set does not reflect the actual magnitudes or frequency of emission events. 
• 
Emission event data for the Murphy and Allen study were collected before industry was required to 
monitor HRVOC.  Therefore, most of the emission estimates are not based upon measurements of 
the events. 
• 
The TCEQ infrared camera studies have found numerous instances where emissions were 
emanating from locations that were not included in any emissions inventory. 
• 
The TCEQ flare investigations have found that flares are typically managed to reduce noise, smoke, 
and glare.  Optimizing the flare to keep destruction efficiency at a maximum is a secondary 
consideration.  In particular, flares used as both emergency flares and process flares have been 
observed to operate with poor combustion efficiency when operating in process flare mode 
(Robinson et al., 2008).

• 
In addition, flare monitoring records only the chemicals flowing to the flare, not which species are 
actually being emitted.  Combustion efficiencies are estimates of how much of the original material 
has been destroyed, and no effort is made to estimate the composition or reactivity of the 
combustion products.  Circumstantial evidence from the TexAQS II and from the Study of Houston 
Atmospheric Radical Precursors (SHARP) suggests that formaldehyde may be produced during 
flare combustion, though the absolute quantity of emissions may only constitute a small part of the 
observed ambient formaldehyde (Gilman et al., 2009; De Gouw et al., 2009).  The SHARP field 
campaign in April-May 2009 is investigating this hypothesis in greater depth. 
• 
Field studies (Mellqvist et al., 2007, 2008; de Gouw et al., 2009) and recent infrared camera and 
differential absorption lidar (DIAL) results (Robinson et al., 2008) show that the techniques used by 
industry to estimate HRVOC point source emissions are still inadequate to quantify them properly, 
because these experiments measured much higher emission fluxes than were reported. 
 
A number of recent modeling studies have attempted to investigate the frequency, magnitude, and impact 
of emission events upon ozone in Houston (Webster et al., 2007; Nam et al., 2006, 2008). Since these 
studies are based upon the emission event reports, they have not properly quantified the frequency or 
magnitude of the emission events, due to the problems discussed above.  Therefore, the modeled impact 
of emission events described in the Webster et al. and Nam et al. studies are unlikely to accurately reflect 
the complete impact of emission events in the HGB area.  Since the acquisition of properly quantified 
emissions for all industrial emission events that occur in the HGB area appears to be far in the future, the 
TCEQ has not attempted to speculate on the exact frequency or magnitude of sporadic emission events in 
this modeling exercise. 
 
5.2.1.3  Resolution of Photochemical Modeling Grids   
Numerous studies have investigated the effects of grid size on model behavior (Cohan et al., 2006; Esler, 
2003; Gego et al., 2005; Valari and Menut, 2008).  The main interest in finer grid resolution is that higher 
resolution can increase concentrations of ozone precursors in narrow plumes, which can affect ozone 
production rate and sensitivity to VOC or nitrogen oxides (NOX) within the plumes.  In a city such as 
Houston, using a higher resolution grid is sensible, given the abundance of industrial point sources, which 
can generate narrow plumes.  Researchers during TexAQS 2000 determined that rapid ozone formation 
occurring within narrow industrial plumes are responsible for the highest observed ozone in the HGB 
area, and for the strong ozone gradients that can form.  Strong ozone gradients can cause large increases 
in ozone concentration at monitoring sites as the plume is carried across town by winds that have shifted 
direction and are no longer parallel to the plumes.  To resolve these atmospheric features, the TCEQ is 
using smaller-sized grid cells than previous modeling exercises (2 kilometer (km) × 2 km instead of 4 km 
× 4 km).  In general, the TCEQ has found that smaller grid sizes can yield higher ozone production and 
can alleviate, in part, the commonly observed low bias for ozone within industrial plumes.  There are 
limits to this solution, however; it is inappropriate to decrease grid size indefinitely.  Parameterizations in 
both the meteorological modeling and the photochemical grid modeling are based upon the assumption 
that turbulence features within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) are much smaller than the grid size.  If 
the grid size is decreased to 1 km × 1km or lower, the assumption probably no longer holds, and more 
uncertainty can be added to the modeling as a result of the finer resolution.  If smaller grid sizes are 
desired, large eddy simulation modeling should be considered rather than photochemical grid modeling.   
 
Also, note that if the spatial resolution of the photochemical grid modeling is reduced, then the temporal 
resolution of the meteorological and chemical processes within the model ought to be reduced, to match 
the shorter residence time of precursors in each grid cell. In other words, as the size of the box shrinks, 
the amount of time that a mass of air resides in the box also shrinks, affecting how the ozone chemistry 
plays out.  While the Comprehensive Air Model with Extensions (CAMx) automatically adjusts the time 
step for chemical processes, the meteorological process time step is fixed, based upon the input data from 
the Fifth Generation Meteorological Model (MM5).  While it is possible to extract meteorological output 
with higher temporal resolution, reduction of the time steps seems likely to cause unusual model 
behavior.  The reduction of time steps in regulatory photochemical grid modeling has not been well 
studied.  In the future, it may be desirable to use grid sizes smaller than 2 km, and shorter time steps, but 
for now, TCEQ will refrain from experimenting with finer resolutions.  For this round of modeling, the 

 
 
5-5
TCEQ has reduced the size of the CAMx modeling grid cells from 4 km to 2 km through flexi-nesting, 
but has kept the size of the MM5 modeling grid cells at 4 km.   
 
5.2.1.4  Incommensurability and Model Performance Evaluation   
Swall and Foley (2009) discuss the problems inherent in comparing point measurements to grid cell 
values.  In statistical parlance, this problem is known as incommensurability.  A portion of the difference 
between point measurements and grid cell values is due solely to the fact that measurements made at a 
monitoring station do not generally represent an average of the conditions for the 2 km × 2 km grid cell in 
which it resides.  The ability of a point measurement to represent the average of the entire grid cell area is 
related to how much sub-grid variation is observed in the area.  If sub-grid variation is small, then the 
point measurement and the grid cell value are commensurate.  If the spatial gradients of the variables of 
interest are large, the point measurements are less able to reflect the average conditions of the entire grid 
cell, and therefore they are incommensurate with the grid cell value.   
 
HGB area ozone often has strong spatial gradients due to the rapid ozone formation within industrial 
source plumes.  In the HGB area, the worst ozone model performance is sometimes found in areas with 
the steepest ozone gradients, and the best ozone model performance is often found in areas further 
downwind, where the ozone gradients have lessened.  Swall and Foley demonstrated that 
incommensurability alone is capable of degrading model performance in areas of steep gradients.  They 
state in their discussion:  “This means that, even if the model is performing perfectly and there is no 
observational error, we cannot expect that in a scatterplot, points representing paired modeled and 
observed values will lie on a one-to-one line. Our comparison of Gaussian and exponential correlation 
structures with the same effective range shows that this concern looms larger for correlation structures in 
which there is a rapid decrease in correlation for small distances relative to grid cell size (like the 
exponential).”  While there are other causes of poor model performance as well, note that 
incommensurability is likely to be responsible for some of the differences between model output and 
point measurements.  
 
5.2.1.5  Ensemble Modeling   
A number of researchers have discussed the benefits of using ensembles of models to create more 
accurate forecasts (Pinder et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2007).  Pinder et al. and Zhang et al. have noted that 
probabilistic attainment demonstrations could be made using ensemble modeling and have argued that 
this approach can be more scientifically sound than a deterministic attainment demonstration.  The TCEQ 
acknowledges the potential soundness of the ensemble approach but notes that the current regulatory 
framework does not easily allow for a probabilistic attainment demonstration. 
 
5.2.1.6  Vertical Distribution of Ozone   
Ozonesonde measurements have been made each summer in the HGB area since 2003 (Morris et al., 
2006).  Findings from this study indicate that elevated free tropospheric ozone (i.e., above the PBL) in the 
HGB area is usually underestimated, and it often does not appear to mix down to the ground.  Ozone in 
the lowest layers of the atmosphere often shows much more structure than the model simulates.  The 
implication is that the model is mixing the lowest layers of the atmosphere more efficiently than they are 
actually mixing.  The TCEQ has attempted to address these two issues.  For the free tropospheric ozone, 
the TCEQ has obtained global model output for the appropriate time periods so that boundary conditions 
of free tropospheric ozone are more appropriate.  Some of the discrepancies still persist; they appear to be 
related to phenomena that occur between the outermost domain boundaries and the HGB area. .  For the 
PBL mixing issue, the TCEQ has improved the land cover data and sea surface temperature data in its 
latest round of modeling, in an attempt to improve the simulations of surface energy balance.  In addition, 
the TCEQ has chosen the Eta PBL scheme (i.e., the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic scheme), which appears to be 
more effective at simulating PBL dynamics in the coastal regions than other available schemes.  The 
TCEQ continues to investigate potential improvements for vertical mixing in the modeling. 
 
5.2.1.7  Photolysis Discrepancies Due to Improper Placement of Clouds   
Researchers at the University of Alabama-Huntsville performed a modeling study that examined the 
effects of modeled cloud cover on ozone performance in the HGB area, and found that some of the 

 
 
5-6
shortcomings in model performance could be corrected with better depiction of clouds (Pour-Biazar et al., 
2007).  University of Houston researchers also found that their forecasts were occasionally biased due to 
poor depiction of cloud cover (Byun et al., 2007).  TCEQ-funded research found that higher-order 
decoupled direct method analysis of modeling sensitivities indicated substantial sensitivity to photolysis 
rates (Koo et al., 2008). 
 
The TCEQ has found similar cloud cover effects in the photochemical modeling for this state 
implementation plan (SIP).  The greatest discrepancies tend to involve the model under-predicting cloud 
cover, and hence, greatly over-predicting ozone on low ozone days.  Modeled episode days for which 
cloud cover problems exist include:  May 28, 2005; June 17, 2005; July 31, 2005; Aug 5, 2005; May 31-
June 1, 2006; Aug 15, 2006; Aug 19, 2006; Aug 22, 2006; September 12, 2006; October 10, 2006.  The 
average mean normalized bias for these days is +34.6 percent, compared to an average mean normalized 
bias on exceedance days of +9.7 percent.  TCEQ process analysis shows that most of the radical 
initiation, propagation and termination steps are very sensitive to photolysis rates.  Hence, improvements 
in cloud placement could greatly improve ozone and precursor performance, though the greatest 
improvements will likely occur on low ozone days.   
 
To improve the cloud distribution, the TCEQ has followed the guidance of Texas A&M University 
(TAMU) researcher and state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon and has utilized the Grell cumulus 
parameterization, which reduces the amount of spurious thunderstorm formation in the HGB area.   
 
5.2.1.8  Radical Shortage   
A number of researchers studying urban photochemistry in the HGB area and other cities have found that 
available mechanisms for simulating radical production are unable to replicate the observed radical 
formation and propagation rates (Mao et al., 2007, 2009; Chen et al., 2009).  The process analysis section 
of Appendix I:  Corroborative Analysis for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP discusses this issue in 
detail and compares TCEQ process analyses to the Mao et al. and Chen et al. work.  The TCEQ modeling 
is consistent with the Mao et al. and Chen et al. findings that there is apparently something missing in the 
current mechanisms. The atmospheric chemistry community as a whole has not yet resolved the problem 
or problems with the current mechanisms.  Several hypotheses for the missing radical formation 
mechanism exist, including daytime nitrous acid (HONO) production from nitric acid-aerosol interactions 
and photolysis (Ziemba et al., 2009); isoprene production of hydroxyl radical (OH) (Lelieveld et al., 
2008; North and Ghosh, 2009); formation and decomposition of electronically excited nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2
*) (Li et al., 2008); nitryl chloride (ClNO2) chemistry (Osthoff et al., 2008; Simon et al., 2008); 
improved aromatic chemistry (Faraji et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2007); and molecular chlorine reactions 
(Chang et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2003; Chang and Allen, 2006; Sarwar and Bhave, 2007).  Given the 
manifold hypotheses and the current lack of a definitive explanation, the TCEQ has not incorporated 
modified chemical mechanisms into its base case modeling at this time.  However, the TCEQ continues to 
support investigations for improving chemical mechanisms, and is prepared to adopt an improved 
mechanism when it becomes sufficiently mature. 
 
5.2.2  Model Performance Evaluations:  Implications of the Model Performance of the Current SIP 
Modeling 
Model performance evaluation is presented in Chapter 3, Photochemical Modeling and in its associated 
appendices.  Appendix I:  Corroborative Analysis for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP includes 
two discussions of model performance in the Chemical Process Analysis and Intensive Model 
Performance sections.  In addition, Appendix I:  Corroborative Analysis for the HGB Attainment 
Demonstration SIP  includes a discussion of using 2005 baseline modeling to estimate future 2018 design 
values.  Based upon these evaluations, the following overall conclusions can be reached. 
 
Ozone performance  
• 
The model simulates the location, spatial extent, and relative intensity of ozone relatively well on 
most of the high-ozone days. 
• 
The model consistently underestimates peak ozone within the highest concentration plumes. 
• 
Simulated ozone depicts rapid morning ozone increases (30-50 ppb) relatively well, but tends to 

 
 
5-7
miss afternoon peak concentrations. 
• 
Radical and ozone precursor budgets were calculated directly from observations by Mao et al. 
(2009) at the Moody Tower during TexAQS II.  They observed that ozone formation in the HGB 
area is both VOC- and NOX-sensitive, with VOC-sensitive ozone formation usually occurring in 
the morning and NOX-sensitive formation occurring in the afternoon.  Based upon the TCEQ’s 
process analysis, the TCEQ modeling appears to be simulating the VOC- and NOX-sensitivity of 
ozone formation at Moody Tower relatively well, because the relative radical termination rates 
generally agree with the Mao et al. data. 
• 
Process analysis and modeling sensitivity analyses show that peak eight-hour ozone is primarily 
NOX-sensitive in much of the domain, but can be VOC-sensitive downwind of the urban core and 
the HGB industrial areas. 
• 
According to TCEQ process analyses, VOC-sensitive conditions occur more often and more 
strongly in the industrial and urban core plumes.  When ozone production is VOC-sensitive, 
usually more ozone is created than in NOX-sensitive conditions.  
• 
Chen et al. (2009) used the Moody Tower TexAQS II observations to constrain a steady-state 
photochemical box model.  They used the Carbon Bond 05 chemical mechanism and several 
other chemical mechanisms to simulate the chemistry with the box model.  They found that all of 
the chemical mechanisms underestimated peak daytime radical concentrations. The Carbon Bond 
05 mechanism used by the TCEQ in this modeling exercise is one of the better performing 
mechanisms, but it still doesn’t make enough radicals.  The shortfall in radical production may be 
related to the shortfall in ozone production rates observed in the photochemical grid modeling.  
Note, however, that the results from Chen et al. are based upon a constrained steady-state box 
model, which assumes that the chemical system is in a photochemical steady state.  It isn’t clear 
whether this assumption is valid all of the time in the HGB area.  
• 
Decreases in ozone production rates and other reaction rates correlate with decreases in NO2 
photolysis, implying that most of the ozone formation chemistry is highly sensitive to photolysis, 
and hence, highly sensitive to cloud-cover errors. 
• 
Background ozone concentrations are important in accurately simulating the modeling for the 
HGB area. For most of the modeled days, the background ozone is unlikely to bias the modeling 
results in the HGB area, but during the July-August 2005 episode, excessively high background 
concentrations seem to compromise the model performance. 
• 
In rural areas, the model routinely over-predicts nighttime ozone and under-predicts NOX.  The 
cause of this issue is unknown, but it could involve unreported NOX sources or problems with 
vertical mixing in rural areas. 
• 
Above the planetary boundary layer, the model sometimes underestimated ozone concentrations, 
especially in the springtime.  Usually the high ozone above the PBL was not being mixed 
downward, so that this error usually did not have much effect upon the ozone concentrations in 
the HGB area.   
• 
Transport and mixing of urban and industrial emissions within the HGB area can apparently 
affect the ozone chemistry substantially, especially when the urban core plume and the industrial 
plumes mix together.  Ozone behavior, including VOC- and NOX-sensitivity, appears to change 
when these plumes mix.  The implication is that the VOC- and NOX-sensitivity of ozone 
formation in the HGB area depend somewhat on the wind direction. 
• 
Since ozone was sometimes overestimated during the evening hours, the model did not display 
the amount of dynamic range present in the observations. 
 
Ozone precursor performance 
• 
In general, the modeling simulated ozone precursors relatively well, albeit with a large degree of 
scatter, and the peak concentrations for some species were underestimated. 
• 
NO2 was usually simulated in an unbiased manner, but nitric oxide (NO) was often 
underestimated for the peak concentrations, which were usually observed in the pre-dawn hours, 
i.e., during morning rush hour. 
• 
The highly reactive Carbon Bond 05 species ETH and OLE, which represent ethylene, propylene, 
and other alkenes, were well simulated much of the time, but the model tended to underestimate 

 
 
5-8
the peak concentrations.  Concentrations of these two species were routinely overestimated at the 
Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitoring site. 
• 
The performance of isoprene, represented by the Carbon Bond 05 species ISOP, was mixed, with 
some areas showing no bias, others showing high bias, and others showing low bias.   
• 
Formaldehyde data were available during the TexAQS II study at three sites.  For the Moody 
Tower site, the concentrations were usually well simulated, but the peak concentrations were 
underestimated.  For the Lynchburg Ferry (CAMS 1015) and HRM-3 Haden Road (CAMS 603) 
sites, the performance was mediocre.  The HRM-3 Haden Road (CAMS 603) observations were 
consistent with secondary formaldehyde formation as the main source of formaldehyde, but the 
diurnal patterns of the modeled concentrations were more consistent with a primary source:  
concentrations peaked in the pre-dawn hours, like NO.  The aircraft data generally show that the 
model underestimated formaldehyde peaks, though the location, extent, and relative magnitude 
were well simulated, much like the ozone data. 
 
Meteorological performance evaluation 
• 
The meteorological modeling was able to successfully replicate the major features of ozone 
episodes in the HGB area much of the time, including the typical veering pattern of local winds, 
stagnation and flow reversal, and the coastal oscillations associated with the Galveston Bay 
breeze and Gulf breeze. 
• 
Trajectory analyses and vertical wind profiles in the HGB area show that much of the time on 
high ozone days, the model transported ozone and precursors to approximately the correct areas 
at approximately the correct times. 
• 
The model occasionally did not generate enough cloud cover, resulting in high ozone on days 
when low ozone was observed.  While the addition of the Grell cumulus parameterization and 
improved land surface characteristics data appeared to reduce the common problem of spurious 
thunderstorms, the problem has not been completely eliminated. 
• 
Episode days with strong stagnation were more difficult to model precisely than days for which 
the winds did not stagnate.  The model sometimes simulated nighttime winds that were too brisk, 
resulting in more dilution of emissions than was actually observed. 
• 
Ozonesonde and radar profiler data indicate that for most episode days, the PBL over land 
appeared to be modeled with good accuracy.  Over water, however, planetary boundary layer 
depth was consistently modeled less accurately.   
 
Model response to emission changes 
• 
The base case modeling has been challenged with different emissions inventories in order to 
evaluate its dynamic response to emission changes (Gilliland et al., 2009). 
• 
Adding more VOC to the flare emissions increases peak ozone concentrations, though the 
emission changes do not completely correct the ozone underestimations.  Addition of 
formaldehyde emissions to HRVOC flares increases peak ozone concentrations further. 
• 
Substitution of flare emissions for the standard emission reconciliation tends to improve the 
model performance by increasing ozone production close to the industrial emission sources and 
by increasing the peak ozone concentrations, without adversely affecting ozone performance at 
other times and places. 
• 
Modeled ozone appears to decrease slightly in response to NOX emission decreases typical of the 
changes that occur on weekends.  The observed weekend effect is a slightly stronger response to 
NOX emission decreases, implying that the model may be slightly less NOX-sensitive than it 
should be. 
• 
Modeled ozone increases substantially in response to VOC and NOX emission increases 
commensurate with the difference between 2006 emissions and 2000 emissions in the HGB area.  
When relative response factors are calculated using 2000 as the baseline year and 2006 as the 
future year, the modeled response to emission reductions is less vigorous than the observed 
response.  This finding implies that the current modeling appears to underestimate the response to 
emission controls.  If the atmosphere responds to the emission reductions from 2006 to 2018 in a 
manner similar to its response to the emission reductions between 2000 and 2006, the actual 
decrease in ozone design value will be greater than the model predicts. 

 
 
5-9
• 
Some of the strongest model responses to emission changes occur outside the boundaries of the 
current ozone monitoring network, and sometimes outside the current nonattainment area.  This 
finding suggests that the proposed controls may have a greater impact on ozone than the 
responses registered at the different monitoring sites would indicate.   
 
5.2.3  Model Response to Proposed Controls:  Additional Ways to Measure Progress 
Table 5-1:  Changes in the Area and Population Affected by an Eight-Hour Ozone Design Value Greater 
than or Equal to 85 ppb in Response to Growth and Controls shows how the area affected by high ozone 
is expected to shrink dramatically in response to the emission changes projected to occur between 2006 
and 2018.  Even though peak ozone drops by only 8 percent, the area with an estimated ozone design 
value greater than the 85 ppb standard shrinks by 96 percent.  The population living in those areas and 
how the changes might reduce the number of people that encounter high ozone were considered.  The 
estimated number of people residing in the high ozone areas decreases by 92 percent.  Note that the 
population data is from the 2000 Census and has not been grown to reflect changes in population in those 
areas in 2006 or 2018.  Also note that the numbers reflect areas where people reside, i.e., their home 
addresses, not necessarily where they might be during the hours of highest ozone during the ozone season.  
However, the dramatic decrease in the area with high ozone suggests that ozone decreases arising from 
the proposed control strategies are likely to benefit many residents of the HGB area.

5.2.4  Conclusion  
The photochemical grid model performed by the TCEQ for this SIP revision has been rigorously 
evaluated against observational data.  While there are a number of shortcomings that this modeling has in 
common with other modeling exercises in the HGB area as discussed in Sections 5.2.1, Solving Modeling 
Problems, and 5.2.2, , Model Performance Evaluations:  Implications of the Model Performance of the 
Current SIP Modeling, modeling for many of the simulated ozone days appears to behave in a manner 
consistent with most of the atmospheric phenomena of interest.  Evaluation of the modeling response to 
emission changes appears to show that the modeled ozone is slightly less responsive to emission changes 
than the observed ozone.  Thus, modeling of 2018 emissions with the proposed control package in place 
may overpredict the future ozone concentrations. 
   
5.3  AIR QUALITY TRENDS IN THE HGB AREA 
This section describes analyses of air quality observational data in the HGB area.  Trends in ozone and its 
precursors demonstrate not only the substantial progress the HGB area has made in improving air quality 
but also the magnitude of the future challenge in attaining the ozone NAAQS.  Trends are also useful to 
show how ozone is related to its precursors.  Decreases in NOX and VOC demonstrate the effectiveness of 
policies to reduce emissions; however, due to its dependence on meteorological variables, ozone may not 
always exhibit trends identical to its precursors.  Separating variations in meteorological factors from 
trends in ozone and its precursors can highlight whether ozone reductions are due to decreases in 

 
 
5-10
precursor emissions or are due to year-to-year variability in local meteorology (Sullivan, 2009; Camalier, 
et al., 2007).   
 
5.3.1  Ozone Trends 
This section examines the frequency at which the NAAQS for ozone are exceeded, with the 
understanding that the 1997 eight-hour standard of 0.08 ppm is the subject of interest for this SIP revision 
and that the one-hour standard is no longer in effect, but still a useful benchmark for understanding ozone 
behavior in the HGB area.  While the NAAQS is expressed in units of ppm, this section will use the 
familiar convention of expressing concentrations in ppb.   
 
The trend in design values for the HGB area is seen clearly in Figure 5-1:  Ozone Design Values for the 
HGB Area.  While the HGB area continues to exceed both the one-hour and eight-hour ozone standards, 
one-hour ozone design values have generally decreased over the past 17 years, and eight-hour ozone 
design values have decreased over at least the past nine years.  The eight-hour ozone design value in 2008 
was 91 ppb, a 24 percent decrease from the 1991 design value of 119 ppb.  The 2008 value is approaching 
the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS of 85 ppb.  A regression analysis of design value on year estimates 
that eight-hour ozone design values decreased at the rate of 1.2 ppb per year, which is statistically 
significant at the 5 percent level (α = 0.05).  If this trend were to continue at that rate, attainment of the 
1997 eight-hour standard could be reached in five years, though if the pace of recent years were 
maintained, it could occur even sooner.

The one-hour ozone design value in 2008 was 147 ppb, a 33 percent decrease from the 1991 design value 
of 220 ppb.  Regression of one-hour design values on year shows they decreased at the rate of 3.6 ppb per 
year, which is faster than the decrease for eight-hour ozone design values; the slope is also statistically 
significant at the 5 percent level.

The design value in a metropolitan area is the highest design value of all of the area’s monitors’ 
individual design values.  Because ozone varies spatially, it is also prudent to investigate trends at 
all monitors in an area.  Table 5-2:  Eight-Hour Ozone Design Values (in ppb) for Each 
Regulatory Monitor in the HGB Area and Table 5-3:  One-Hour Ozone Design Values (in ppb) 
for Each Regulatory Monitor in the HGB Area contain the eight-hour and one-hour ozone design 
values at all regulatory monitors in the HGB area from 1991 to 2008.  More monitors than these 
operate in the HGB area, but because the data at those monitors do not meet the EPA’s quality 
control standards, the design values at those additional monitors are not displayed here.  These 
non-regulatory monitors are discussed in Section 5.2.2:  Model Performance Evaluations:  
Implications of the Model Performance of the Current SIP Modeling.

Note: Missing values indicate a monitor was not operating during that year or did not produce a valid year of data.  Only one year of valid data is required to calculate a one-hour ozone design value; therefore, some monitors 
that have a one-hour ozone design value may not have an eight-hour ozone design value.  

 
 
5-14
 
Figure 5-2:  Eight-Hour Ozone Design Value Statistics for All Monitors in the HGB Area and 
Figure 5-3: One-Hour Ozone Design Value Statistics for All Monitors in the HGB Area display 
three summary statistics for the eight-hour and one-hour design values, respectively:  the 
maximum, median, and minimum design values computed across all monitors in the HGB area.  
These figures facilitate assessment of the range of design values observed within a year, as well 
as how these distributions change over time.  From these figures, it appears that neither eight-
hour nor one-hour design values exhibited a noticeable trend until about 1999, after which both 
began falling steadily.  Before 2002, no monitors in the HGB area met either standard; since then, 
the area has seen a steady increase in the number of monitors attaining both standards.  By 2008, 
over half of the monitors in the area had attained both standards, as median ozone design values 
fell below the NAAQS that year.

Ozone trends can also be investigated by looking at the number of days an exceedance of the 
ozone NAAQS was recorded, termed an exceedance day.  An exceedance day for the 1997 eight-
hour ozone NAAQS is any day that any monitor in the area measures an eight-hour average 
ozone concentration greater than or equal to 85 ppb over any eight-hour period.  An exceedance 
day for the one-hour ozone NAAQS is any day that any monitor in the area measures a one-hour 
average ozone concentration greater than or equal to 125 ppb for at least one hour.  Previous 
research (Savanich, unpublished, 2006) by the TCEQ has shown that, until 2006, the number of 
exceedance days was positively correlated with the number of monitors in a particular area.  As 
the number of monitors increases, so does the number of exceedance days recorded, at least until 
the area has been saturated with monitors or until ozone concentrations truly decrease.  Because 
of this correlation, when examining exceedance-day trends, the number of monitors must always 
be considered.  Thus, it is especially noteworthy that Figure 5-4:  Number of Monitors and Ozone 
Exceedance Days in the HGB Area shows that, despite an increase in the number of monitors, the 
number of exceedance days for both one-hour and 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS has decreased, 
a decrease that is especially pronounced over the past three years.  Since 1999, the number of 
1997 eight-hour and one-hour ozone exceedance days occurring in the HGB area has fallen 83 
percent and 96 percent, respectively.  In just the last three years, the number of 1997 eight-hour 
and one-hour ozone exceedance days has fallen 76 percent and 92 percent, respectively.

Figure 5-4:  Number of Monitors and Ozone Exceedance Days in the HGB Area 
 
 
Results for individual monitors, displayed in Figure 5-5: Number of 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone 
Exceedance Days by Monitor and Figure 5-6: Number of One-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by 
Monitor support the conclusion that the number of exceedance days at individual monitors also 
appears to be decreasing.  Figure 5-5: Number of 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by 
Monitor highlights two monitors, Houston Aldine (CAMS 8) (red line) and Houston Bayland 
Park (CAMS 53) (blue line), that recorded the most 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS exceedances 
in the past.  Since recent peaks in 1999 (at Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53)) and in 2000 
(Houston Aldine (CAMS 8)), neither monitor, in any year, has come within 60 percent of these 
peaks; in 2008 both monitors experienced at least an 85 percent reduction from the recent peaks.  
While results for other monitors are less impressive, overall, the trend in ozone exceedance days 
at monitors throughout the HGB area is clearly downward.  Due to the large number of monitors 
in the HGB area, data from Figure 5-5:  Number of  1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by 
Monitor and Figure 5-6:  Number of One-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by Monitor  are 
presented in Table 5-4:  Number of Days with a 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance and Table 5-
5:  Number of Days with a One-Hour Ozone Exceedance for detailed inspection.

Figure 5-6:  Number of One-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by Monitor 
 
 
The progress achieved in recent years in reducing eight-hour and one-hour ozone concentrations 
in the HGB area is evident in Table 5-4: Number of Days with a 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone 
Exceedance and Table 5-5: Number of Days with a One-Hour Ozone Exceedance.  The number of 
times the monitors in the HGB area registered daily peak eight-hour ozone ≥ 85 ppb fell from a 

 
 
5-18
high of 340 occurrences in 1995, to 39 occurrences in 2007, to 19 occurrences in 2008.  Prior to 
2007, that number was never below 90.  The number of monitors recording at least one 
exceedance of the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard has fallen by half, from a maximum of 23 
monitors in 2003 to only 12 in 2008. 
 
A similar pattern is apparent with the number of exceedances of the one-hour ozone NAAQS 
presented in Table 5-5: Number of Days with a One-Hour Ozone Exceedance.  The table shows 
that the total number of one-hour ozone NAAQS exceedance occurrences fell from a high of 165 
in 1995 to just three in 2008.  Prior to 2005, the number of one-hour exceedances was never 
below 50.  The three exceedances in 2008 occurred at only two monitors.  As recently as 2006, a 
total of 15 monitors recorded at least one exceedance.  This significant progress has occurred in a 
fairly short amount of time in an area well known for its air quality challenges.

The ozone season spans the entire year in the HGB area; the period of elevated ozone 
concentrations, however, varies from year to year.  Figure 5-7:  1997 Eight-Hour Ozone 
Exceedance Days in the HGB Area shows the frequency of, and variation in, the number of 1997 
eight-hour ozone NAAQS exceedance days in the HGB area by month and year.  While the 
duration and intensity of the ozone season does vary from year to year, in the past few years the 
HGB area has experienced fewer ozone exceedance days over fewer months.  The darker areas in 
the figure show that peak ozone season in the HGB area typically occurs from August to 
September, with a smaller, secondary peak occurring earlier, roughly in June.

Figure 5-7: 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days in the HGB Area 
 
 
In summary, the number and intensity of ozone exceedances in the HGB area has been dropping, 
especially since 2000, with 2007 and 2008 demonstrating the largest of these decreases. 
 
5.3.2  Ozone Trends at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors 
Twenty-three monitors in the HGB area, listed in Table 5-6:  Eight-Hour Ozone Design Values at 
Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors and Table 5-7:  One-Hour Ozone Design Values at 
Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors report ozone concentrations following EPA 
certification protocols and are used for attainment determinations for regulatory purposes.  
However, since 2003, over 20 additional monitors have become operational in the HGB area that 
measure ozone concentrations following protocols that have not been certified to EPA standards.  
Usually, this means fewer calibrations and/or zero and span checks.  These non-regulatory 
monitors are located throughout the HGB area.  The locations were chosen with the aim of 
ensuring that all episodes of elevated ozone and precursors are observed.  The additional 
monitoring sites also help to describe the spatial extent and distribution of high ozone more fully 
than the regulatory monitors alone.  While the non-regulatory monitors are not acceptable for 
making regulatory determinations, they help describe the spatial patterns of ozone more 
completely and thus provide a broader perspective on trends in ozone concentrations across the 
HGB area.

The annual maximum of each series is noted in boldface type.  Because of the way design values are computed, some monitors in 
some years may have one-hour but not eight-hour design values 
 
Figure 5-8:  Distributions of Eight-Hour Ozone Design Values at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory 
Monitors in the HGB Area compares eight-hour ozone design values at regulatory and non-
regulatory monitors in the HGB area from 2003 to 2008.  This period was chosen because many 
non-regulatory monitors only became operational, or had complete data, in 2003 and later years.  
The distributions of eight-hour ozone design values dropped for both types of monitors over the 
six-year period, though the interquartile range, a measure of spread between high and low values, 
did not narrow noticeably for either.  Annual median fourth high eight-hour ozone design values 
fell from 90 ppb in 2003 to 80 ppb in 2008 at regulatory monitors, a drop of 11.1 percent.  The 
median at non-regulatory monitors fell from 89 ppb to 81 ppb over the period, a 9.0 percent drop. 
 
While medians and other moments from the distributions all dropped over the period, the annual 
maximum eight-hour ozone design value is most relevant, as this value is the current standard 
used for regulatory attainment determinations.  The annual maximum eight-hour ozone design 
value measured at regulatory monitors fell from 102 ppb in 2003 to 91 ppb in 2008, a drop of 
10.4 percent.  The annual maximum at non-regulatory monitors fell from 96 ppb in 2005, when 
three-year design values were first computable, to 94 ppb in 2008, a drop of 2.1 percent.  Note, 
however, that maximum eight-hour design values at non-regulatory monitors in 2006 and 2007 
were higher than in 2008, 104 ppb and 100 ppb respectively, presumably because those years are 
strongly influenced by the fourth high value observed at Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) in 2006 
(111 ppb).  Even though this 2006 fourth high value continued to influence the 2008 design value, 
when averaged with the 2008 fourth high value of 85 ppb, the three-year average dropped to 94 
ppb, a 6 percent decline in a single year.

The ozone design values computed for the non-regulatory monitors are within the range of design 
values computed for the regulatory monitors.  This finding suggests that both sets of monitors 
observe the same ozone behavior.  
 
Figure 5-9:  Distributions of One-Hour Ozone Design Values at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory 
Monitors in the HGB Area compares one-hour ozone design values at regulatory and non-
regulatory monitors in the HGB area from 2003 to 2008.  This period was chosen because many 
non-regulatory monitors became operational or had complete data in 2003 and later years.  The 
one-hour design value is computed as the fourth highest one-hour value observed among all 
values during each rolling three calendar-year period.  The distributions of one-hour ozone design 
values dropped for both types of monitors over the six-year period and the spread between high 
and low values narrowed for both.  Annual median fourth high one-hour ozone design values fell 
from 141 ppb in 2003 to 118 ppb in 2008 at regulatory monitors, a drop of 16.3 percent.  The 
median at non-regulatory monitors fell from 149 ppb to 122 ppb over the period, an 18.1 percent 
drop. 
 
While medians and other moments from the distributions all dropped over the period, the annual 
maximum one-hour ozone design value is most relevant, as this design value would be compared 
to the one-hour ozone NAAQS to determine attainment, were the one-hour standard still in force.  
The annual maximum one-hour ozone design value measured at regulatory monitors fell from 
175 ppb in 2003 to 147 ppb in 2008, a drop of 16.0 percent.  The annual maximum at non-
regulatory monitors fell from 161 ppb to 138 ppb over the period, or 14.3 percent.  Note that the 
eight-hour design value does not change when the data from the non-regulatory monitors are 
added to the calculation.

Figure 5-10:  1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory 
Monitors, 2003 through 2008 presents the number of days per year from 2003 through 2008 that 
the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS was exceeded in the HGB area at regulatory monitors and at 
all monitors, both regulatory and non-regulatory.  Since 2005, the combined network has 
recorded a total of 19 additional exceedances of the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard that would 
not have been captured by the regulatory network, i.e., about four to five per year.  This result 
confirms earlier findings that suggest as the monitoring network has expanded, fewer episodes of 
elevated ozone concentrations are likely to elude detection.

Figure 5-11:  One-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors, 
2003 through 2008 presents the number of days per year from 2003 through 2008 that the one-
hour ozone NAAQS was exceeded in the HGB area at regulatory monitors and at all monitors, 
both regulatory and non-regulatory.  Both series initially increased, then fell at similar rates 
throughout the period, suggesting that the two sets of monitors measure broadly similar 
phenomena.  During the first half of the period, non-regulatory monitors measured from five to 
nine additional exceedance days that were not detected by regulatory monitors.  However, in the 
second half of the period, that gap dropped to only two to three additional days, indicating that 
non-regulatory monitors are detecting fewer and fewer events not detected by regulatory 
monitors.  This result confirms earlier findings that suggest that, as the monitoring network has 
expanded, fewer episodes of elevated ozone concentrations are likely to elude detection.

Another way to see the ozone trend in the HGB area is to examine how the spatial distributions of 
ozone have changed over the years.  Figure 5-12:  Eight-Hour Ozone Design Values for 2000, 
2005, and 2008 shows the spatial distribution of eight-hour ozone design values in the HGB area, 
for regulatory monitors only, and the changes that have occurred from 2000 to 2005 to 2008.  In 
2000, local peaks in design value were at Houston Aldine (CAMS 8), Houston Bayland Park 
(CAMS 53), and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139), and all three peaks were 110 ppb or higher. 
 
By 2005, eight-hour ozone design values had dropped across the region.  While the highest 
concentrations still occurred at Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 
35/139), they were no longer observed in the Houston Aldine (CAMS 8) area.  Further, the 2005 
peaks are much lower, between 100 and 103 ppb.  The lowest eight-hour ozone concentration is 
still observed at Lang (CAMS 408), but low ozone also occurs to the northeast at Houston North 
Wayside (CAMS 405), to the north at Conroe (CAMS 65) or Conroe Relocated (CAMS 78), and 
to the south at Galveston Airport (CAMS 34/CAMS 109/CAMS 154).  The minimum eight-hour 
ozone concentration in 2005 is below the 1997 NAAQS.   
 
In 2008, eight-hour ozone design values dropped even further.  Ozone concentrations are 
substantially lower across a large part of the HGB area, with the kriging model predicting design 
values below the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS at many locations.  Maximum eight-hour ozone 
concentrations are now considerably lower, between 89 ppb and 91 ppb.  The highest 
measurements occurred at Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139), 
and also at a new monitor, Park Place (CAMS 416), which measured ozone in the same range as 
Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139).  The eight-hour ozone 
concentrations in 2008 are lower throughout the HGB area, with a local ozone minimum located 
in the urban core area surrounding the Lang (CAMS 408), Houston North Wayside (CAMS 405), 
Houston Texas Avenue (CAMS 411), Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304), and the 
TCEQ Houston Regional Office (CAMS 81) monitors. 
 
Notice that while the overall concentrations of eight-hour ozone are lower, the areas that 
experience the highest and lowest ozone remain the same.  Spatial interpolation shows that high 
ozone concentrations continue to occur south of downtown Houston, and stretch from the 
Houston Ship Channel in the east to west Houston, near Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53).  The 
lowest ozone values are found to the south along the coast, at the northern edge of the 
nonattainment area towards Conroe (CAMS 65), and to the northwest of downtown Houston, at 
Lang (CAMS 408).

The kriging method can also be employed to investigate the geographic origins of high ozone 
concentrations.  Studies during the TexAQS 2000 field study reported that the highest ozone in 
the HGB area occurs in plumes emanating from industrial areas (Daum et al., 2004; Kleinman et 
al., 2005; Ryerson et al., 2003; Berkowitz et al., 2005; Banta et al., 2005).  As these plumes are 
transported across the region, they can be tracked by the high ozone concentrations recorded at 
successive downwind monitors as the day progresses.  An analysis of the time of day of 
maximum ozone at each monitoring site can confirm or challenge conclusions of the field study 
about these origins by revealing spatial patterns of ozone formation and movement. 
 
Yet another way to examine the ozone behavior in the HGB area is to investigate the time of day 
that ozone peaks, on average, in each part of the monitoring network.  Daily maximum ozone 
concentrations were divided into two groups:  days with values exceeding the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone NAAQS, and days not exceeding the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS.  The time of day 
when peak ozone was recorded at each monitor was determined for each day, then averaged 
across the two groupings of days.  Only monitors that report data to the EPA were included.  
Days were restricted to March through November to exclude months when few or no exceedance 
days occur in the HGB area. 
 
Maps of the time of peak ozone in the HGB area, averaged from March through November 1998-
2008, are found in Figure 5-13:  Time of Day of Peak Hourly Ozone on Low and High Ozone 
Days.  The left map shows that on days with low eight-hour ozone values, daily maximum values 
are recorded in the Galveston area early in the day, between 11:30 a.m. and 11:45 a.m.  Inland 
monitors record their highest daily values at progressively later times of day, as monitors are 
located farther inland from the Gulf Coast.  On low ozone days, the earliest ozone maxima occur 
near the coast, and the latest occur in the Conroe area between 2:00 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. This 
pattern of ozone concentrations is consistent with the occurrence of the sea breeze, which often 
dominates local weather during the summer in the absence of strong synoptic-scale weather 
influences.  After the plume is carried past a monitor, ozone levels often drop, reflecting the 
cleaner maritime air behind the sea breeze front.   
 
By contrast, the right map of the daily pattern on high eight-hour ozone days looks quite different.  
Daily maximum ozone concentrations are observed earliest in the industrial areas, and 
successively later at sites that are progressively farther away from these areas.  This pattern 
indicates that high ozone forms first in the industrial areas, and is transported outward to urban, 
suburban, and rural sites later in the day.  Maximum ozone occurs latest at Lake Jackson (CAMS 
1016), Clute (CAMS 11), Northwest Harris Co. (CAMS 26), Conroe (CAMS 65) and Conroe 
Relocated (CAMS 78), the sites at the greatest distance from the industrial area. 
 
The time of day of maximum ozone on high eight-hour ozone days represents a composite 
pattern:  high ozone formed in industrial areas is carried by winds to Conroe (CAMS 65) and 
Conroe Relocated (CAMS 78) on some days, to Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016) on other days, and 
to western Houston on other days.  Combined with the earlier spatial design value analysis, the 
patterns of peak ozone appear to show that the highest ozone concentrations are formed in the 
vicinity of the heavily industrialized areas of metropolitan Houston and are then transported 
throughout the area.

5.3.3  Trends in the Strength of Observed Ozone Gradients in the HGB Area 
Rapid ozone increases have been observed at HGB area monitoring sites for many years, but the 
phenomenon was not sufficiently explained until the TexAQS 2000 study.  Researchers from 
Brookhaven National Laboratory and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) Aeronomy Laboratory were able to establish that the rapid ozone increases were due to 
strong spatial ozone gradients that arose when ozone formed very rapidly in industrial plumes.  
The rapid ozone formation observed by Daum et al. (2003, 2004) allowed ozone to build up in the 
plumes before ozone and its precursors could disperse.  Shifting winds due to the coastal 
oscillation or bay/Gulf breeze phenomena pushed the strong ozone gradients over the monitoring 
sites, resulting in observations of rapid ozone increases (Banta et al., 2005).  The rapid ozone 
formation occurs when industrial HRVOC reacts with co-emitted NOX (Ryerson et al., 2003; 
Wert et al., 2003).  The following analysis examines whether the strength of these ozone 
gradients has lessened, as measured by the magnitude of one-hour changes in ozone observed at 
monitoring sites. 
 
One-hour changes in ozone concentrations examined for each hour during the ozone season (May 
through October) at each site for each year.  The maximum daily peak change in ozone 
concentration was chosen for each day, and various statistical measures were calculated from 
those values.  Not all sites were included in this analysis:  only those with long operating histories 
were included.   
 
Figure 5-14:  Trends in the Strength of Ozone Gradients Measured in the HGB Area from 1995 
through 2008 shows how the daily maximum one-hour change in ozone has changed since 1995 
in the HGB area.  While at the mean and median levels the change is slight, the steepest observed 
ozone gradients have been reduced dramatically since 1995, decreasing by about 40 percent.

Figure 5-15:  The Number of Occurrences of One-Hour Increases in Ozone Greater Than 40 
ppb/hr in the HGB Area for the Subset of Monitors with Long Historical Records shows that the 
number of strong ozone gradients observed by monitoring sites in the HGB area has also 
decreased substantially since the 1990s, matching the general trends in decreasing ozone 
concentrations. The intensity of ozone gradients has decreased, and the frequency of strong ozone 
gradient observations has also decreased, which strongly suggests that ozone is forming less 
rapidly in the HGB area than in previous years.  This change in ozone behavior is consistent with 
decreasing reactivity of VOC emitted in the HGB area.  Note that the intensity of ozone gradients 
can depend upon meteorological factors as well as chemical factors.  This analysis has not 
examined the importance of meteorological factors upon the observed trends.  Subsequent 
sections will discuss trends in HRVOC concentrations.

5.3.4  The Impact of Hurricane Ike on Ozone Observations in the HGB Area 
The HGB area typically records high ozone values each year in September.  Sometimes, these 
values help determine the area-wide design value for that year.  The HGB eight-hour ozone 
design value has been declining recently and was particularly low in 2008 (91 ppb).  September 
2008 was not typical for the HGB area.  Hurricane Ike, a strong Category 2 hurricane, struck the 
Texas coast near Galveston Bay on September 13, 2008.  Most monitors in the area were shut 
down and emissions patterns were substantially altered. 
 
Hurricane Ike struck the Texas coast near Galveston Bay on September 13, 2008.  Before the 
hurricane struck, the evacuation of Galveston Island and the surrounding areas created enormous 
traffic jams.  After the storm passed, there was far less automobile traffic than normal for several 
weeks.  In preparation for the storm, many of the local petrochemical facilities shut down their 
operations, generating unknown quantities of emissions in the process, and after the storm, their 
operations were atypical for an extended period.  Rescue operations, tree cutting and burning, 
lack of electrical power, unusual traffic patterns, and abnormal industrial operations were among 
the atypical conditions that occurred before, during, and after the hurricane.  The exact effect of 
the emission changes on ozone concentrations is unknown, due to the number of ozone 
monitoring sites disabled indirectly or directly by Hurricane Ike.  Monitors in the HGB area 
ceased operations for as little as one day, and as long as 69 days at a site that was severely 
damaged by storm surge.  Key monitors that typically record the area design values were down 
for as much as 16 days, e.g., Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) (see Table 5-10:  List of the 
Number of Days HGB Ozone Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors were Not Operating 
Before and After the Landfall of Hurricane Ike).

Hurricane Ike’s greatest impact occurred during the second half of September and the first half of 
October.  August and September are typically the months when the HGB area records the most 
number of days that exceed the ozone standard.  For 2000 through 2008, 21 percent of the 266 
observed 85 ppb exceedance days in the HGB area were recorded in September (Figure 5-16:  
Number of Days that Exceeded the 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone NAAQS by Month from 2000 through 
2008).

for All Ozone Monitoring Sites in Texas, September 2008 show peak eight-hour ozone at all 
Texas monitoring sites in September 2006, which was unaffected by tropical systems and in  
September 2008, the month in which Hurricane Ike struck.  In 2008, the number of monitors in 
operation dropped substantially just before the hurricane made landfall, as they were shut down 
by the TCEQ.  The monitors came back on-line gradually, as electrical power was restored, and 
storm damage was repaired.  Ozone concentrations immediately before and after Ike were fairly 
low.   
 
The purpose of this analysis is to examine how the ozone behavior in September and October 
2008 deviated from the 2000 through 2007 average, and thus to ascertain whether the lower 
design value observed in 2008 was due primarily to the effects of Hurricane Ike.

5.3.4.1  Approach 
One approach to estimate the influence of Hurricane Ike on the HGB area’s ozone design value is 
to estimate what the eight-hour ozone design value might have been in 2008 if Hurricane Ike had 
not occurred.  This estimate is derived from historical data collected during 2000-2007.  
Removing calendar days affected by Hurricane Ike and replacing them with averages derived 
from historical data yields a re-calculated fourth-highest eight-hour ozone concentration for each 
monitor.  The actual fourth-high is then divided by the re-calculated fourth-high to obtain an 

 
 
5-38
adjustment ratio or an Ike Adjustment Factor (IAF).  This ratio is expected to be greater than one, 
and can be used to adjust 2008 ozone data to non-hurricane conditions.  The IAF can be 
calculated as an area-wide average IAF or as a monitor-specific IAF.  An area-wide average IAF 
is computed as the average of all IAFs from all monitors in the region, applied to all 2008 data.  
The monitor-specific IAF was applied only to the monitor in question.  After the data were 
adjusted with  IAFs, an IAF-corrected design value was calculated and compared to the current 
unadjusted ozone design value to determine the influence of Hurricane Ike.   
 
The days affected by Hurricane Ike are not easy to identify.  As stated before, many unusual 
activities occurred in the HGB area before the arrival of Hurricane Ike, and many others occurred 
in the aftermath.  For example, many industrial facilities shut down operations before the storm 
arrived, releasing emissions that they usually would not release.  After the hurricane, electrical 
power was not available in parts of the HGB area for two or more weeks.  Given the difficulties 
in establishing the exact period of Hurricane Ike’s influence, alternative IAFs were calculated by 
removing three different time periods from the historical ozone data.  The first period considered 
for exclusion was a two-week period from September 11 through September 25, 2008, which 
includes days immediately before and after the hurricane.  Two other periods considered for 
exclusion were a one-month period from September 6 through October 5, 2008, and a one-month 
period after the storm (September 13 through October 12, 2008).   All data used in this analysis 
were obtained from the TCEQ-LEADS system, and are eight-hour ozone averages.  The HGB 
area eight-hour ozone design value was obtained from the EPA. 
 
5.3.4.2  Results 
Table 5-11:  Alternative Fourth-High Daily Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration Calculations 
Using Different Ike Adjustment Factors (IAFs) shows results of the six different methods for 
estimating the fourth-high daily peak eight-hour ozone concentration for each monitoring site.  
The table shows that the expected fourth high is greater than the observed at most sites, regardless 
of which method is used to calculate the expected fourth high.  This indicates that the atypical 
conditions experienced during and after Hurricane Ike during September and October in 2008 did 
have an effect on the monitored values, but the effect was no greater than 4 ppb on the fourth-
high daily maximum ozone concentration.

This table compares the observed 2008 fourth-high at each monitor to the expected fourth high, as 
calculated by six different methods. 
 
 
The attainment status of an area is not based upon fourth-high ozone concentrations, but upon 
design values.  Table 5-12:  Observed and Expected Design Values, Recalculated to Account for 
Hurricane Ike shows the observed 2008 design value, and the expected design values, as 
calculated with the six different methods described above.  As Table 5-12:  Observed and 
Expected Design Values, Recalculated to Account for Hurricane Ike shows, the effect upon the 
design value for the HGB area is at most 1 ppb, and for two of the alternatives there is no effect.  
This analysis is robust, because six different methods of estimating the effect of the hurricane on 
ozone design value have given substantially the same answer:  the 2008 eight-hour ozone design 
value was not different from the expected design value, based upon comparisons with historical 
data.  Therefore, based upon the historical analysis, the effect of Hurricane Ike upon the eight-
hour ozone design value in the HGB area was apparently minimal.

5.3.5  NOX Trends 
Nitrogen oxides, or NOX, are a variable mixture of NO and NO2 and are critical precursors to 
ozone formation.  NOX is primarily created by fossil fuel combustion, lightning, biomass burning, 
and microbial action in the soil. 
 
Previous analyses performed using aircraft measurements and emission inventories obtained 
during TexAQS 2000 and TexAQS II indicate that NOX emissions in the Houston Ship Channel 
area have decreased between 2000 and 2006 (Cowling et al., 2007).  Furthermore, aircraft data 
obtained during the two field studies were in agreement with data measured by continuous 
emission monitoring systems (CEMS) located at the facilities.  Analyses done by the Rapid 
Science Synthesis Team of the 2005-2006 Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS II) indicate that 
NOX emissions at several electric generating units (EGUs) have decreased by factors ranging 
from two to four between 2000 and 2006 (Cowling et al., 2007).  These reductions were seen at 
EGUs that implemented NOX control features, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), 
between 2000 and 2006, which suggests these control strategies are working.  The two field 
studies effectively describe the emissions during two short time windows, six years apart.  To 
complement these analyses, the TCEQ has performed a more comprehensive investigation of 
long-term trends in NOX concentrations. 
 
Daily peak one-hour NOX from all monitors in the HGB area from 1991 through 2008 is plotted 
in Figure 5-19:  Daily Peak Hourly NOX in the HGB Area.  The increasing density of NOX data 
points shows that the number of NOX monitors in the HGB area has greatly increased since 1991.  
Annual 90th percentile and annual average NOX values are also plotted in the figure.  Both of 
these measures have decreased markedly over the 1991 to 2008 period, falling 64 percent and 68 
percent, respectively.  Even more remarkable may be the 53 percent and 48 percent declines since 
1999.

Annual decreases are computed as compound annual rates. 
 
 
Though highly variable from season to season, daily peak hourly NOX also shows a general 
decreasing trend since 1991.  Maximum NOX concentrations have decreased overall by 41 
percent  since 1999, an average of roughly 32 ppb per year, or nearly 6 percent per year.  The 
drop since the 1991 high of 880 ppb is 54 percent or greater than 4 percent annually. 
 
Average daily peak hourly NOX has dropped even more precipitously, falling 53 percent, or 8 
percent per year, from 75 ppb to 35 ppb, since 1999.   Since 1991, average hourly NOX has 
dropped 68 percent, or over 6 percent per year, from the series high of 110 ppb.  Notice that in 
2008, both the NO2 design value and maximum daily peak NOX recorded the lowest values of any 
previous year back to 1991. 
 

 
 
5-43
While the highest NOX values occur in the winter, the NOX values during the summer months, 
when ozone production is the highest, are of particular interest.  Trends in median hourly NOX 
concentrations at individual monitors in the HGB area from May through October, 1998 to 2008, 
are shown in Figure 5-20:  Median NOX Concentrations in the HGB Area.  Four monitors of 
particular interest, Houston Texas Avenue (CAMS 411), Lang (CAMS 408), Clinton (CAMS 
403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304), and Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53), are highlighted.  Sites with 
less than 75 percent complete data for a year were not plotted for that year; for example, Clinton 
(CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) had less than 75 percent complete data in 2008 and 
therefore was not plotted.

Figure 5-20:  Median NOX Concentrations in the HGB Area 
 
 
Median NOX values tend to vary from year to year, but most monitors show overall decreases in 
median NOX since 1998.  Monitors that show the smallest decreases or show no change are at 
sites that have traditionally had lower NOX concentrations.  Some of the largest median NOX 
concentrations were measured at the Lang (CAMS 408) monitor (in close proximity to Highway 
290), and at the Houston Texas Avenue (CAMS 411) monitor (in downtown Houston).  These 
monitors are both near major roadways; their similar trends suggest they may be measuring 
decreases in NOX emissions from mobile sources.  Monitors at Galveston Airport (CAMS 
34/C109/C154), Seabrook Friendship Park (CAMS 45), and Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016) 
measured the lowest median NOX concentrations. 
 
Sites recording among the highest ozone design values, for example, Houston Bayland Park 
(CAMS 53) and Park Place (CAMS 416), are not necessarily the sites with the highest median 
NOX concentrations.  The previous section showed that Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) has 
the highest eight-hour ozone design value in the HGB area of 91 ppb, yet it has a lower median 
NOX concentration than many other sites in the area.  This observation is consistent with the 
behavior expected from ozone chemistry; in addition to being an ozone precursor, NO also reacts 
directly with ozone and in areas with high NO emissions, can destroy more ozone than it creates.  

 
 
5-44
Downwind from the high emission areas, however, ozone destroyed by reaction with NO can re-
form. 
 
The largest decreases since 1998 (Table 5-14:  Median and 90th Percentile Hourly NOX Values) 
were observed at monitors primarily influenced by mobile source emissions, rather than industrial 
sources.  Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) and Houston East (CAMS 1), which are 
located near both industrial sources and highways, have seen larger decreases in median NOX 
values than in 90th percentile values since 1998.  At Houston East (CAMS 1), the 90th percentile 
value decreased 34 percent, while the median decreased 42 percent between 1998 and 2008.  The 
Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) monitor experienced a drop of 16 percent in the 90th 
percentile, with a 21 percent decrease in the median between 1998 and 2007 (2008 was not used 
due to incomplete data), though these measures have increased in recent years.

* Percentage changes computed from 1998 to 2007 for years missing 2008 data, due to 
incomplete data. 
Monitors are sorted in increasing order by percentage change in median values.  Monitors with 
indeterminate trends began operating after 1998. 
 
While several monitors recorded large decreases from 2007 to 2008, most others observed only 
minimal changes over that same period.  These large disparities in patterns of ambient NOX 
concentrations across the region are appropriate for further investigation, suggesting that larger 
decreases are not due solely to variations in meteorological conditions, which would be expected 

 
 
5-45
to influence all monitors similarly, though not identically.  The differences seem to be related to 
the relative magnitudes of the overall concentrations.  Sites with the highest concentrations, 
which tend to be urban sites, showed the greatest decrease.  More rural sites like Lake Jackson 
(CAMS 1016), Conroe (CAMS 65), and Conroe Relocated (CAMS 78) may reflect slight 
changes in background values, while more urban sites may reflect actual emission changes. 
 
Similar to ozone, NOX concentrations in the HGB area appear to be decreasing over time, in large 
measure the result of the comprehensive suite of NOX-targeted controls implemented since 2000.  
Stringent point source NOX standards have been adopted along with numerous factors affecting 
mobile source NOX emissions.   
 
5.3.6  Ambient VOC Concentrations 
The other major class of compounds that are ozone precursors are VOC.  TexAQS 2000 
researchers identified a specific subset of VOC that were closely associated with rapid and 
efficient ozone formation, i.e., light alkenes (Ryerson et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2003, 2004; 
Jobson et al., 2004).  The TCEQ examined the historical data for these compounds, and decided 
to regulate several light alkenes emitted by industry that were particularly reactive, and that often 
had particularly high concentrations: ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes.   
 
Since the mid-1990s, the TCEQ has collected 40-minute measurements, on an hourly basis, of 45 
VOC compounds using automated gas chromatograph (auto-GC) instruments.  Initially, 
measurements were collected at just one site (Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304)), but 
in subsequent years, auto-GC monitors have been added to new sites (see Figure 5-21:  Houston 
Ship Channel Auto-GC Monitors and 2006 Reported Point Source HRVOC Emissions Points and 
Plant Boundaries).  Currently, eight sites, listed in Table 5-15:  Auto-GC Monitors in the Houston 
Ship Channel Area, along or near the Houston Ship Channel, along with three in Brazoria County 
and one in Texas City, are collecting VOC measurements with auto-GCs.

Ambient concentrations of the TCEQ-defined HRVOC (ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-
butene, c-2-butene, and t-2-butene) were analyzed from 1995 to 2008.

Trends at each of the eight Houston Ship Channel monitors were examined.  Data from the four 
other auto-GC monitors were analyzed only for trend slope and possible statistical significance of 
trends.  Daily geometric means were computed from valid ambient hourly measurements for days 
with at least 18 valid hours of data.  A geometric mean was calculated by taking the natural 
logarithm of each of the measurements, averaging these logs, then calculating the antilog of this 
mean log value.  The geometric mean is a preferable statistic to median or arithmetic (ordinary) 
mean for evaluating the central tendency of data when the data are skewed, that is, when the data 
are not symmetrically, or normally, distributed, but clustered around extreme high or low values.  
It is more robust than an ordinary average, meaning its value is not greatly influenced by one or a 
few very high or very low values.  Many distributions of pollutant measurements in the HGB area 
are skewed.  Monthly geometric means were also computed with a 75 percent data completeness 
criterion for valid days in a month. 
 
Figure 5-22:  Monthly Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors, July 1995 through December 2008 shows monthly geometric mean ethylene 
concentrations, ordered according to the monitor location from west to east.  Grey bars denote the 
range of values from the 25th through 75th percentile concentrations, for all monitors.  Noteworthy 
in this figure is the frequency of extremely high values recorded during the 1990s at Clinton 
(CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304), at the western end of the Houston Ship Channel, and Deer 
Park (CAMS 35/139), in south central Houston Ship Channel.  These were the only monitors 
operating during the early years of this period; this pattern suggests that high ethylene 
concentrations were not restricted to certain areas of the Houston Ship Channel, but were 
somewhat geographically widespread.  
 
 

 
 
5-47
Figure 5-22:  Monthly Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors, July 1995 through December 2008 
 
 
For four consecutive years, July 1995 through July 1999, valid monthly geometric mean 
concentrations at Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) exceeded the 75th percentile of the 
multi-decade series.  Deer Park (CAMS 35/139) also exhibited high concentrations in the first 
several years, including the highest mean value for any complete month, 10.2 parts per billion, 
carbon (ppbC) in March 2001.  By contrast, few monthly mean concentrations exceeded the 75th 
percentile in the most recent four years, 2005 through 2008. 
 
Though measured ethylene and propylene concentrations show a large degree of variability at all 
auto-GC monitors, downward trends are apparent at seven of the eight; only Wallisville Road 

 
 
5-48
(CAMS 617) appears to show no decrease.  A statistical trend analysis, described below, provides 
further insight into this. 
 
Peak monthly geometric mean ethylene concentrations at all monitors, 6.9 ppbC and 8.4 ppbC in 
2003 and 2004 respectively, decreased to 5.6 ppbC in 2005, 4.9 ppbC in 2006, and 4.5 ppbC in 
2007, before climbing to 5.1 ppbC in 2008.  This decline in ambient ethylene concentrations 
suggests that ethylene emissions in the Houston Ship Channel are declining, though meteorology 
could be responsible for some or all of the decline in geometric mean concentrations. 
 
Similar to Figure 5-22:  Monthly Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston 
Ship Channel Monitors, July 1995 through December 2008, Figure 5-23:  Monthly Geometric 
Mean Propylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston Ship Channel Monitors, July 1995 through 
December 2008 displays monthly geometric mean concentrations of propylene for the eight 
Houston Ship Channel area auto-GC monitors.  Again, Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 
304) and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139) show higher concentrations in earlier years compared to 
recent ones; however, the magnitude of concentrations at the two monitors are dissimilar, unlike 
ethylene, suggesting elevated propylene concentrations are more geographically limited than 
elevated ethylene concentrations.  Two other eastern Houston Ship Channel monitors, 
Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 115) and Lynchburg Ferry (CAMS 1015), report concentrations 
well above the 75th percentile in 2003, and to a lesser extent in 2004 and subsequent years, 
suggesting there are greater propylene emissions in the eastern Houston Ship Channel than the 
western Houston Ship Channel.  However, the relatively fast reactivity of propylene, compared to 
ethylene, may explain part or all of the low concentrations seen in the western Houston Ship 
Channel. 
 
Similar analyses were performed for 1, 3-butadiene and the isomers of butene; however, trends in 
these pollutants can be difficult to interpret, as their relatively low concentrations are frequently 
within accepted measurement uncertainty.  Further work is needed before trend estimation for 
these compounds can be considered accurate.   
 
Though still variable from month to month, pervasive decreases in the ambient concentrations of 
ethylene and propylene suggest that overall industrial emissions of these compounds have 
decreased considerably since 1995.  This finding agrees with early reports from TexAQS II that 
ethylene emissions along the Houston Ship Channel have decreased approximately 40 percent

Figure 5-23:  Monthly Geometric Mean Propylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston 
Ship Channel Monitors, July 1995 through December 2008 
 
 
A preliminary analysis was performed to verify whether decreases observed were statistically 
significant.  Ordinary least squares regression lines were fit to the monthly geometric mean 
ethylene and propylene concentrations, using an index of month, where the first recorded month 
was given a value of zero.  Results of these fits are reported in Table 5-16:  Parameter Estimates 
of Monthly Geometric Mean Concentrations Trends.  In 23 of the 24 regressions, concentrations 
decreased across the respective study periods, with correlation coefficient (R2) values ranging 
from 0.045 to 0.549.  Eight of 12 monitors recorded statistically significant decreases for 
ethylene, including six of eight Houston Ship Channel monitors.  All 12 monitors recorded 
statistically significant decreases for propylene.  However, caution must be exercised when 

 
 
5-50
interpreting these results.  First, some of the computed R2 values are very low, confirming there is 
a substantial degree of variation in the measured values, with only a portion of it explained by a 
simple linear model.  Further statistical testing and verification, such as testing for and correcting 
possible autocorrelation, is necessary to fully validate these models.

5.3.7  Geographic Patterns in Ambient HRVOC Concentrations Near the Houston Ship 
Channel 
The next analysis showed that, for some HRVOC, geographic patterns are apparent.  Wind speed 
and wind direction measurements, collected in tandem with HRVOC concentrations at the 
Houston Ship Channel auto-GC monitors, were used not only to identify these patterns, but to 
track their changes over time.  Radar plots of geometric mean concentrations of ethylene and 
propylene, by wind direction, were plotted, superimposed on maps of the Houston Ship Channel, 
and displayed in Figure 5-24:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors through Figure 5-27: Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Western 
Houston Ship Channel Monitors. 
 
These plots consist of jagged rings encircling a monitor.  Each ring around a particular monitor 
represents the geometric mean concentration of the subject HRVOC at each of the 360 degrees 
surrounding the monitor, for a particular year.  The distance from the origin to any point on the 
ring is proportional to the concentration of HRVOC arriving at the monitor from that direction.  
For example, Figure 5-25:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at Eastern Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors shows that in 2003 at Deer Park (CAMS 35/139), the highest mean ethylene 
concentration, 16 ppbC, occurred when winds were blowing from the northeast, suggesting there 
may be large ethylene emissions sources upwind of Deer Park (CAMS 35/139) in that direction.   
 
To help interpret these graphs, it is useful to describe a couple of hypothetical scenarios.  In the 
first one, if HRVOC did not vary when winds arrived from different directions, i.e., the same 
concentrations were observed regardless of the wind direction, the ring would be a smooth circle.  

 
 
5-51
Conversely, in the second scenario, if HRVOC were detected only when winds arrived from a 
single direction, the ring would simply be an elongated spike pointing in that direction. 
 
In Figures 5-24: Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors through 5-27: Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors, for the Houston Ship Channel monitors, a strong directional association with 
mean concentration is typical.  The directional spikes seen in these rings are referred to as “lobes” 
in this section. 
 
 
Figure 5-24:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors 
 
 
Sources of ethylene (blue circles) and propylene (brown circles) are also depicted on the map of 
the respective compound, with sizes proportional to values reported in the 2006 TCEQ point 
source emissions inventory.  Valid hourly measurements from 2002 through 2008 were used; 
hours with hourly wind speed measurements less than two miles per hour (mph) were discarded, 
due to considerable error in wind direction measurements at low wind speeds. 
 
While a compound’s concentration for a particular wind direction at a particular monitor is 
proportional to the distance from the monitor to the ring at that direction, the scale differs across 
monitors.  For example, peak 2003 ethylene concentration (see Figure 5-25:  Geometric Mean 
Ethylene Concentrations at Eastern Houston Ship Channel Monitors) at Lynchburg Ferry 
(CAMS 1015) is 24 ppbC, and 15 ppbC at Wallisville Road (CAMS 617), yet the length from 
each monitor to its respective peak (tip of sharp “point”) is approximately the same.  For this 
reason, peak concentration at each monitor, for each pollutant, is labeled.

Figure 5-25:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors 
 
 
Figure 5-24:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors shows mean ethylene concentrations at the three western-most Houston Ship Channel 
auto-GC monitors.  Sources of ethylene having the greatest impact on these monitors are all 
located east of the monitors, because the greatest peaks for each monitor point in this direction for 
all the years.  The plot also shows trends across time at each monitor.  At Clinton (CAMS 
403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304), peak ethylene occurred in 2003 from almost due east, as seen in the 
lobe labeled “14 ppbC.”  Following 2003 and 2004, peak concentrations from that direction have 
been somewhat lower.  Also, the lobes pointing south observed in 2003 and 2004 are markedly 
smaller in 2005 and subsequent years.  An olefins production plant located in the Houston Milby 
Park (A169) area shut down in 2005; its emissions may have been responsible for those lobes. 
 
The plot shows mean ethylene concentrations for the Cesar Chavez (CAMS 1020/175) and 
Houston Milby Park (A169) monitors, which started operation in 2004 and 2005, respectively.  
While these monitors measured peak concentrations in different years, both monitors have peaks 
pointing in the direction of the Houston Milby Park (A169) olefins plant while it was in 
operation; Houston Milby Park (A169) observed a large lobe to the southeast in 2005, and Cesar 
Chavez (CAMS 1020/175) observed a notable lobe to the north in 2004 and 2005.  This provides 
a stronger indication, when combined with the Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) peak 
to the south, of the influence of emissions from that plant on local concentrations. 
 
Figure 5-25:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors shows mean ethylene concentrations at the five auto-GC monitors located in the eastern 
part of the Houston Ship Channel.  Variation in mean concentrations by direction is even more 
pronounced here than in the western portion of the Houston Ship Channel.  The pattern in mean 
concentrations at Lynchburg Ferry (CAMS 1015) suggests there is a large source of ethylene 
emissions south-southeast of the monitor, near Battleground Road and Highway 225, and that 
emissions from this area have decreased.

Table 5-17:  Geometric Mean Ethylene for Key Wind Direction Lobes at Eastern Houston Ship

The pattern observed at Deer Park (CAMS 35/139) may provide additional evidence of suspected 
emission decreases in the same source area.  The northeast lobe in Table 5-17:  Geometric Mean 
Ethylene for Key Wind Direction Lobes at Eastern Houston Ship Channel Monitors has dropped 
from a high of 16.6 ppbC in 2003 to a range of about 11 to 13 ppbC in recent years.  Similarly, 
the southeast lobe at Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 115), which points yet again to the same 
source area, peaked at 12.5 ppbC in 2003, dropped to 11.9 ppbC in 2004, and has not exceeded 
7.1 ppbC since.  While this monitor is farther from this source region than are the other two 
monitors, and therefore is more likely to be impacted by other emissions sources, consistent 
decreases observed at these three monitors across the six-year span of available data suggest 
ethylene emissions have decreased in the subject source region.   
 
HRM-3 Haden Road (CAMS 603) shows a peak of 24.8 ppbC to the southeast in 2003, which fell 
to 18 ppbC in 2004, then further to 15.6 ppbC in 2005.  The mean concentration has dropped 
since then, not exceeding 5.2 ppbC.  The magnitude of the decrease over 2006 to 2008, as 
compared to 2005 and earlier years, suggests a shut down of one or more major process units, or 
even entire plants, somewhere southeast of this monitor, or implementation of HRVOC rules. 
 
Peaks at the Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor point southwest, toward the east Houston 
Ship Channel, and east-northeast, in the direction of the Mont Belvieu industrial area, where there 
is considerable ethylene and propylene storage in underground salt caverns.  Table 5-17:  
Geometric Mean Ethylene for Key Wind Direction Lobes at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors shows that ethylene originating to the southwest decreased from the six-year peak in 
2003 (15 ppbC), to a range from 9.9 to 11.1 ppbC, before rising slightly to 12.8 ppbC in 2008.  In 
contrast, the east-northeast lobe at this monitor shows relatively unvarying mean concentrations 

 
 
5-54
across the entire six-year period, ranging from 9.2 to 11.6 ppbC, with the six-year peak occurring 
in 2008. 
 
These conclusions for five monitors and eight directional lobes show a nearly consistent pattern 
across these monitors.  Seven of eight lobes witnessed their highest mean concentration in 2003.  
Within one or two years of this peak, concentrations at all seven had dropped, from 27 to 65 
percent, and have leveled off since; mean concentrations have not varied appreciably from 2006 
to 2008.  These findings suggest ethylene emissions from source areas close to these monitors, 
especially Battleground Road, Highway 225 in La Porte, and the petrochemical complex north of 
the Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 115) monitor, have decreased considerably in recent years.  
These observations suggest that the new TCEQ regulations specifically targeting HRVOC 
emissions and requiring full compliance by 2006 are proving effective in controlling point source 
HRVOC emissions.  However, the trends shown here have not been corrected for meteorological 
variations.   
 
Results for the lobe pointing east-northeast from the Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor 
disagree with some key findings at other lobes.  The Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) east-northeast 
lobe, unique among the eight, experienced an increase in mean concentration from 2003 (9.7 
ppbC) to 2004 (11.5 ppbC). While 2006 to 2008 mean concentrations at Wallisville Road (CAMS 
617), like those of other monitors and lobes, changed relatively little, mean concentrations of the 
east-northeast Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) lobe changed relatively little across the entire six-
year period.  The absence of recent decreases at this lobe compared to earlier years suggests that 
meteorology may not have caused high concentrations seen at most other lobes in earlier years. 
 
Figure 5-26:  Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors displays monthly geometric mean concentrations of propylene in the same area of the 
eastern Houston Ship Channel.  Table 5-18:  Geometric Mean Propylene Concentrations for Key 
Wind Directions at Eastern Houston Ship Channel Monitors lists mean propylene concentrations 
across the study period, for each monitor and lobe.  Similarities with ethylene are evident.  For 
propylene, all seven lobes measured their highest concentrations in 2003 or 2004; five of the 
seven had their two lowest annual concentrations in 2007 and 2008.  All seven lobes had 
concentrations in 2007 and 2008 that were 40 percent or more lower than their respective six-year 
peaks. 

 
 
5-55
 
 
Figure 5-26:  Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors 
 
 
These results suggest that the propylene emissions in the source regions near the monitors have 
dropped considerably in the six-year study period, and that the HRVOC regulations may be 
responsible for the decreases.  As seen with ethylene, patterns in geometric mean propylene 
concentrations at the east-northeast Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) lobe differed considerably 
from the other seven.  Propylene concentrations varied relatively little across the six-year period, 
suggesting that, like ethylene, Mont Belvieu propylene emissions have changed little or not at all, 
on average, across the study period. 
 
Figure 5-27:  Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors shows mean propylene concentrations by wind direction at the three western Houston 
Ship Channel monitors.  Patterns depicted here exhibit strong similarities to those seen with 
ethylene in this area:  the largest propylene source areas are to the east, and judging from the 
disappearance of strong peaks from 2006 onward, emissions from the now-defunct olefins plant 
located in the Houston Milby Park (A169) area were probably affecting these monitors.

5.3.8  Ambient Total VOC Concentrations  
Considerable research has focused on patterns and trends in HRVOC concentrations in the HGB 
area (Hafner Main et al. 2001; Brown and Hafner Main, 2002; Jolly et al., 2003; Fang and 
McDowell, 2003).  Less examined are patterns for other, less-reactive VOC.  This section 
presents a detailed examination of patterns in total VOC concentrations in the HGB area, using 
concentrations of total nonmethane hydrocarbons (TNMHC) as a measure of total VOC.  Each 
TNMHC measurement corresponds to the sum of all chromatogram peaks (identified and 
unidentified) from the start to the end of sample collection.  TNMHC is a useful measure of total 
VOC because it has been calculated in a consistent manner over the entire study period, unlike 
other parameters, such as the sum of Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) 
target compounds, whose constituents have changed periodically.   
 
Similar to the first HRVOC analysis presented in this section, geometric mean TNMHC 
concentrations, by monitor, year, and month, were calculated for valid months for all available 
data from each of the 12 HGB monitors.  Further analysis of the four non-Houston Ship Channel-
area monitors has not been completed at this time. 
 
Figure 5-28:  Monthly Geometric Mean TNMHC Concentrations, July 1995 through December 
2008 shows, for each of the eight Houston Ship Channel monitors, monthly geometric mean 
TNMHC concentration for all months with complete data, between the start of monitoring and 
December 2008.  Monitors are sorted according to their location from west (top) to east (bottom); 
the grey bars denote the 25th through 75th percentile concentrations (85 ppbC and 149 ppbC 
respectively) of all valid months across all monitors. 
 
As with ethylene and propylene, the two monitors with data before 2001, Clinton (CAMS 
403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139), recorded their highest monthly 
geometric mean values before 2001.  Both monitors exhibited overall decreases across their 
respective data collection periods.  A statistical analysis of possible trends, using ordinary least 
squares regression, is presented in Table 5-19:  Parameter Estimates of Monthly Geometric Mean 
TNMHC Concentration Trends Houston Ship Channel Area Auto-GC Monitors.  This statistical 
model indicates that all 12 monitors had decreasing monthly mean concentrations, from the 
beginning to the end of each monitor’s respective data range.  As well, this model indicates that 
eight of the 12 monitors’ decreases were statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence 
level.

Figure 5-29:  90th Percentile TNMHC Concentration in the HGB Area presents 90th percentile 
TNMHC concentrations at each auto-GC monitor.  The area-wide 90th percentile TNMHC 
concentrations and the 90th percentile TNMHC at most of the individual monitors are decreasing.  
Smaller decreases are evident at Wallisville Road (CAMS 617), Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 
115), Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016), Mustang Bayou (CAMS 619), and Danciger (CAMS 618), 
while larger decreases are observed primarily at monitors closer to the Houston Ship Channel.  
Monitors in Brazoria County (Danciger (CAMS 618), Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016), and Mustang 
Bayou (CAMS 619)) and Galveston County (Texas City 34th St. (CAMS 620)) tend to report 
lower 90th percentile TNMHC than monitors located in Harris County.  In the past, Clinton 
(CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) has recorded the highest TNMHC concentrations, but since 
2006 Clinton has decreased at a faster rate and Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 115) has 
recorded the highest concentrations.

5.3.9  Meteorologically Adjusted Ozone Trends 
Ozone formation is dependent not only on its precursors (NOX and VOC), but also on 
meteorological variables.  While trends in ozone design values have been decreasing, design 
value trends must be examined to determine if the values are decreasing due to emission controls 
or if they are decreasing simply because of meteorological conditions in the area in the past 
several years.  To determine whether control strategies have been effective, meteorological 
influences must be removed from ozone trends.  Analysis done by Sullivan (2009) used a 
generalized linear model to account for meteorological influences in ozone trends.  The following 
discussion is based upon Sullivan (2009), who used a modified version of the Camalier et al. 
(2007) technique for removing the meteorological influences from the ozone trends. 
 
Before meteorological influences can be removed from ozone trends, the meteorological factors 
that are most important to ozone formation must first be identified.  Various correlations and 
factor analyses were used to identify the most important meteorological variables for ozone 
formation in the HGB area.  Data from the Omnibus Meteorological Database (METDAT) 
maintained by the EPA was compared to ozone data obtained from surface monitors in the HGB 
area.  Because the set of observed ozone levels can be influenced by the number of monitors in an 
area, Sullivan (2009) used a consistent set of ozone monitors in the HGB area.  These monitors 
are listed in Table 5-20:  Area Ozone Monitoring Sites with Long-Term Data.  Most contain a 
consistent set of data from 1990 to 2007.  Data from monitors that were moved a short distance 
during the period from 1990 to 2007 were combined with data from monitors in nearby locations, 
for example, data at Clute (CAMS 11) were combined with data from Lake Jackson (CAMS 
1016).

Figure 5-30:  Actual Mean Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations (Blue Line) and Mean Eight-Hour 
Predicted Concentrations with the Non-Meteorological Trend Removed (Red Line), which was 
reproduced from Sullivan (2009), displays two time series.  The values in blue represent the 
observed mean daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentrations; values in red represent the daily 
peak ozone based purely on the meteorological variations, with the non-meteorological factors 
removed.  In other words, the statistical model described above has been used to re-create the 
ozone time series with only the meteorology taken into account.   
 
For 2006 and 2007, the statistical model predicts that the observed mean daily peak eight-hour 
ozone should have been higher than observed, based upon the conduciveness of the meteorology 
toward ozone formation.  In other words, based on the weather, ozone concentrations should have 
been higher in 2006 and 2007.  Subtracting the meteorologically-based eight-hour ozone 
estimates from the actual eight-hour ozone results in a trend with the meteorological effects 
removed (Figure 5-31:  Residual Meteorologically Adjusted Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations 
Trend).  This trend represents how the sum of anthropogenic factors, model error, and 
undiagnosed meteorological factors have changed from 1996 to 2007.  Figure 5-31:  Residual 
Meteorologically Adjusted Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations Trend, which was reproduced from 
Sullivan et al., 2009, represents the trend in peak daily maximum ozone with the meteorological 
factors removed.  The meteorologically-adjusted ozone trend is clearly downward.  Since the 
meteorological variations have been removed, this downward trend shows the effect of emission 
reductions in the HGB area.  Statistical results of this analysis are listed in Table 5-21:  Summary 
Statistics for Meteorologically Adjusted Ozone Trends from 1996 to 2007.  The slope of -0.86 
shows that eight-hour ozone trends in the HGB area are decreasing and that they are significant 
(p-value = 0.00).

The analysis from Sullivan (2009) shows that, after adjusting for meteorology, concentrations of 
ozone has declined substantially in the HGB area.  All else held equal, daily maximum eight-hour 
ozone concentrations in the HGB area should be around 9 ppb lower in 2007 compared to 1996. 
 
5.3.10  Background Ozone Concentrations:  Transport of Ozone into the HGB Area 
Estimating the levels of ozone transported into the HGB area is important in order to identify so 
that the amount of locally produced ozone.  Several researchers have previously investigated the 
background ozone concentrations in Texas and the transport winds that are associated with them.  
Nielsen-Gammon et al. (2005) investigated background ozone from 1998-2003 in the HGB area 
and obtained the following insights (paraphrased from Nielsen-Gammon et al., 2005): 
 
• 
The seasonal variability in eight-hour maximum ozone in eastern Texas is primarily 
associated with background ozone. Local contributions tend to be highest during the 
summer when background ozone reaches a minimum. 
• 
The late spring peak in eight-hour maximum ozone in eastern Texas is primarily 
associated with “tropospheric background” ozone. This ozone maximum has been 
observed at rural sites elsewhere and is associated with variations in the lifetime of 
ozone, the concentrations of NOx, and enhanced transport from the stratosphere. 
• 
The midsummer minimum in background ozone in eastern Texas leads to a minimum in 
eight-hour peak ozone that is strongest in southeastern Texas and barely noticeable in 
northeastern Texas. The primary cause of the summertime minimum is a decline in the 
tropospheric background ozone. Although the relatively clean southerly flow is 
weakening during this period, most air parcel paths remain maritime in nature. 
• 
When easterly and northeasterly winds become more frequent in late summer, 
background ozone and total ozone in eastern Texas begin rising.  Winds are also less 
steady than in the middle of summer, so continental transport becomes increasingly 
frequent. 
 
Langford et al. (2009) showed that the techniques used by Nielsen-Gammon et al. (2005) yielded 
results consistent with a different technique of estimating background, except on some occasions 
when the Galveston Airport (CAMS 34/CAMS 109/CAMS 154) site was chosen as the 
background site.  Langford et al. showed that the Galveston site is the site most strongly affected 
by the Gulf breeze, and that on some days, the maritime air from the Gulf does not affect the 
Houston area, even though this air affects Galveston.  Hardesty et al. (2007) have shown that 
during the TexAQS II study in August through September 2006, background ozone in southeast 
Texas averaged about 50 ppb, with background concentrations lower near the coast, and higher in 
northeast Texas.  On one day, September 8, 2006, the background ozone entering Texas from east 
was 85-90 ppb.  The results of these studies have shown that background ozone entering 
southeast Texas can have a large effect on the total observed eight-hour ozone concentrations.  To 
investigate the role of background ozone for the most recent years, the TCEQ commissioned a 
study of background ozone and its relationship to larger-scale wind patterns.  Below is a 
description of this work.

Sullivan (2009) used 72-hour back trajectories calculated with the Hybrid Single Particle 
Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) algorithm, using data from the Ecosystem 
Dynamics and the Atmosphere Section (EDAS) meteorological model to estimate the amount of 
ozone entering into the HGB area.  A total of 1,456 backward trajectories were run starting at 
12:00 Central Standard Time in central Houston, at 300 meters above ground level, during the 
peak of ozone season in the HGB area (May 1 through October 31, 2000 to 2007).  Analysis of 
multiple trajectories can distinguish between source areas, or paths, that lead to higher than 
average, or lower than average ozone concentrations (Sullivan et al., 2009).  A clustering 
algorithm was used to group multiple trajectories based on trajectory size and shape.  Six 
identified clusters appear in Figure 5-32:  Six Clusters Found Using HYSPLIT Backward 
Trajectory Clustering Algorithm, which was reproduced from Sullivan, 2009.  Forty backward 
trajectories that did not end up in any of the six clusters, illustrated in Figure 5-33:  Cluster 0 
Backward Trajectories, reproduced from Sullivan (2009), were grouped and assigned a cluster 
number of zero.  All but one of the back trajectories in cluster zero originate from the south and 
that these trajectories appear to extend beyond the EDAS modeling domain, which is the only 
difference between cluster zero and cluster two.

Figure 5-32:  Six Clusters Found Using HYSPLIT Backward Trajectory Clustering Algorithm 
shows that cluster one and cluster two represent days in which winds originated from the Gulf of 
Mexico; these trajectories typically represent cleaner air coming from the Gulf of Mexico and 
hence lower observed ozone concentrations in the HGB area.  Cluster three represents long 
trajectories, which come into the HGB area from the north as far away as Canada.  This type of 
trajectory can also bring clean air from northern states and Canada into the HGB area.  Cluster 
four represents stagnant air conditions, a frequent cause of ozone accumulation.  Cluster five 
shows trajectories that originate from the northeast, in the Ohio River Valley, that bring polluted 
air from more populated areas into the HGB area.  Cluster six illustrates trajectories from the east, 
some of which cross over Louisiana and the Beaumont-Port Arthur (BPA) area and some of 
which cross over the Gulf of Mexico.  The mean centerline from each of the six clusters is shown 
in Figure 5-34:  Means of Six 60-Hour Backward Trajectory Clusters.  Trajectories were 
compared to ozone concentrations in the HGB area to quantify how these trajectories are related 
to ozone in the HGB area.

Twelve ozone sites, shown in Figure 5-35:  Sites Used in Ozone Area Maximum and Background 
Determination, that had near continuous operation from 2000 to 2007 in the HGB area were 
selected to compare with trajectory clusters.  In an effort to use measurements from a consistent, 
long-term set of monitors, data from sites that were shut down were combined with data from 
sites that began collecting data near the sites that were taken off-line.  Sites where data were 
combined are Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016) and Clute (CAMS 11), and Galveston Airport (CAMS 
34/CAMS 109/CAMS 154) and Galveston Airport 99th St. (CAMS 1034).  Sites were selected 
based on locations as either a site upwind or downwind of the HGB area.  Northwest Harris 
County (CAMS 26), the Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016) / Clute (CAMS 11) combined site pair, and 
the Galveston Airport (CAMS 34/CAMS 109/CAMS 154)/ Galveston 99th St. (CAMS 1034) 
combined site pair generally represent sites measuring background ozone concentrations.  Sites 
on the downwind side of downtown Houston and the Houston Ship Channel generally represent 
sites measuring maximum ozone concentrations in the HGB area.  Maximum peak and minimum 
peak eight-hour ozone concentrations from the twelve monitors were found for each day, then 
merged with the cluster classification from each day.  Following Nielson-Gammon et al. (2005), 
that minimum peak eight-hour average ozone concentration was used to represent the 
“background” ozone level in the HGB Area.

Figure 5-35:  Sites Used in Ozone Area Maximum and Background Determination 
 
 
Table 5-22:  Ozone Statistics for HYSPLIT Back Trajectory Clusters summarizes average 
maximum and average minimum, or background, ozone concentrations for each cluster.  Average 
maximum peak daily eight-hour ozone among the clusters ranges from 40.6 ppb to 73.3 ppb, 
while average minimum peak daily eight-hour ozone, considered a proxy for background ozone 
concentrations, ranges from 21.4 ppb to 45.1 ppb.  The difference between these two means can 
be used as a surrogate for locally produced ozone.  Cluster four and cluster five, which represent 
the short fetch and the northeast fetch, have the highest average maximum ozone concentrations, 
71.6 ppb and 73.3 ppb, respectively, and the highest average background, 40.8 ppb and 45.1 ppb.  
These two clusters also exhibit some of the largest average differences or local contributions.  
Cluster zero, the far southeast cluster, cluster one, the east southeast cluster, and cluster two, the 
southeast cluster, exhibited some of the lowest average background and average peak ozone; 
these clusters are expected to have a lower background ozone due to their origins over the Gulf of 
Mexico.

* May not sum due to rounding.  Note:  Data is May through October, 2000 to 2007.  Fetch 
represents the main direction of the cluster, count is the number of back trajectories in each 
cluster, average minimum peak daily eight-hour ozone is taken as the background ozone 
concentration. Clusters are sorted in descending order by average maximum peak daily eight-hour 
ozone. 
 
The 95 percent confidence intervals for the mean eight-hour ozone maximum for each cluster are 
shown in Table 5-23:  Average Maximum Ozone and 95 Percent Confidence Intervals.  Two 
standard errors were used for the confidence intervals in each row.  The confidence intervals in 
the table show that differences between means are statistically significant for most of the pair-
wise comparison.  This is shown graphically in Figure 5-36:  Average Maximum Ozone and 95 
Percent Confidence Intervals.  Fetches originating from the northeast and east, as well as the 
“short” fetch, have the highest average peak daily ozone values, and they are tightly clustered.  
Clusters originating from the north and far southeast have noticeably wider confidence intervals, 
indicating more variability, but with lower average peak daily ozone concentrations than the 
northeast and east clusters.

Note: Confidence intervals were constructed using two standard errors.  Clusters are sorted in 
descending order by average maximum peak daily eight-hour ozone.  Confidence intervals for 
differences between the area ozone maximums generally do not overlap beyond one or two rows. 
 
 
Although many of the selected sites were intended to represent background and maximum ozone 
in the HGB area, note that on many days true background ozone concentrations may be observed 

 
 
5-70
farther away, in more rural areas, and the true maximum ozone concentration may also be 
underestimated.  Despite uncertainty in estimates of true background and maximum ozone 
concentrations, the large number of observations used in this analysis, as well as evidence 
presented earlier, provide clear evidence that ozone in the HGB area is affected by transport of 
ozone from external sources.

Figure 5-37:  Relationship Between Minimum and Maximum Ozone Concentrations, recreated 
from Sullivan (2009), shows there is a significant linear relationship between mean HGB area 
minimum and maximum eight-hour average ozone concentrations by trajectory cluster (p-value < 
0.01).  The dark red points and estimated regression line represent the relationship between mean 
maximum ozone and mean minimum (background) ozone concentrations by cluster.  The olive 
points and estimated regression line represent the relationship between “local contribution” 
(difference between maximum and minimum) and mean minimum ozone concentrations by 
cluster.  The relationship between maximum and minimum ozone by cluster suggests that 
trajectory direction is a factor determining severity of both HGB area maximum and background 
ozone concentrations (Sullivan, 2009).  The estimated slope parameter (β = 1.36) of the ordinary 
least squares regression of average minimum ozone concentration against average maximum 
ozone concentration shows that maximum ozone concentration increases at a greater rate with 
trajectory direction when compared to minimum ozone.

Figure 5-37:  Relationship Between Minimum and Maximum Ozone Concentrations 
 
 
Figure 5-37:  Relationship Between Minimum and Maximum Ozone Concentrations also shows 
that the difference between mean HGB area maximum and minimum ozone concentrations is also 
roughly linear with area minimum, but with a lower slope (β=0.36) and lesser statistical 
significance (p-value=0.03) (Sullivan, 2009).  The linear relationship between the difference and 
mean HGB area minimum ozone suggests the transport direction also affects local ozone 
production.  The slower air movement of cluster four, which is the “short” cluster, allows greater 
accumulation in the area under lower local surface wind speeds.  Winds originating from the 
directions of cluster six, the “east” cluster, and cluster five, the “northeast” cluster, help to move 
surface air along the area around the Houston Ship Channel and across the downtown Houston 
area, which, as noted, contain large amounts of ozone precursors.  Overall, this analysis shows 
that directions of back trajectories can account for up to 24 ppb of variation in background ozone 
concentrations, and up to 35 ppb of variation in maximum ozone concentrations. 
 
5.3.11  Transport and Surface Wind Trajectories 
While still incomplete, a preliminary analysis of upper level, or transport, wind trajectories was 
conducted to confirm and extend findings from the previously discussed directional analysis.  
Additional HYSPLIT modeling of 48-hour back trajectories at 1,500 meters altitude for May 
through August, 2000 to 2008, was used to detect difference in trajectories across years that may 
have influenced ozone concentrations in the HGB area.   
 
A simple visual inspection of the densities of distributions of trajectory end points presented in 
Figure 5-38:  Distributions of End Points from HYSPLIT 48-Hour Back Trajectories shows that 
upper level wind patterns for 2008, a year which had relatively low ozone concentrations, do not 
noticeably differ from patterns in other years.  Of the years analyzed, the pattern for 2000, a year 
with relatively high levels of ozone, is perhaps the most similar to 2008.  The spatial distribution 
is similar among years and wind speeds are also similar.  Higher wind speeds are evident in 2004 
and 2005, as implied by trajectories with longer fetches.  The implication is that the wind patterns 

 
 
5-72
observed during 2008 were not responsible for the lower ozone concentrations observed, since 
high ozone was observed during other years that had wind patterns similar to 2008.

5.3.12  Background Ozone in Texas 
Research on the meteorology of the HGB area has found that the highest background ozone 
transported into the HGB area predominately originates from the north and northeast (Nielson-
Gammon et al., 2005).   In the present analysis, two techniques are used to examine background 
ozone concentrations in Texas since 2000.  The first technique examines the trend in ozone 
concentrations at four sites that can be considered background sites under certain flow conditions.  
The second technique examines ozone concentrations associated with different patterns of long-
term backward trajectories. 
 
Identifying appropriate background ozone monitoring sites from which to ascertain trends is 
complicated by local ozone, complex wind patterns, and natural variability in background ozone 
itself.  To estimate background ozone, Nielson-Gammon et al. evaluated all monitors in the 
region to identify those that could be considered to be recording background ozone values.  They 
proposed a modification of a TCEQ procedure to identify such sites.   
 
The TCEQ procedure involves determining the direction of transport winds, then selecting a rural 
monitor upwind of the area in that direction.  Nielson-Gammon et al. simply select as the 
background value the lowest of the peak eight-hour ozone values from all monitors.  Unlike the 

 
 
5-73
Nielson-Gammon procedure, which used gridded output of a meteorological model, this analysis 
follows the TCEQ approach using direct measurements of surface winds and tracking background 
ozone concentrations over time at selected monitors.  Modifying the Nielson-Gammon procedure, 
the approach presented here identifies the 90th percentile values recorded at the selected monitors 
and examines the distribution of daily maximum ozone concentrations over time to determine 
whether these supposed background concentrations have increased or decreased.  Both the 
Nielson-Gammon method and the TCEQ method may not strictly estimate background ozone, as 
defined above, because they do not remove any potential recirculation of pollutants generated via 
local emissions.  Also, background ozone alone may not tell the complete story, since ozone 
precursors, which can react with each other and with local emissions to produce ozone, may also 
be present in transported air. 
 
Four candidate monitors were selected for this analysis and are listed in Table 5-24:  Monitors 
Selected for Background Transport Analysis.  Two monitors, West Orange (CAMS 9) and 
Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665), are located east of the HGB area, adjacent to 
the Texas-Louisiana border, east of the BPA area; one, Karnack (CAMS 85), is located in 
northeast Texas near the Texas-Louisiana-Arkansas border and the Tyler-Longview-Marshall 
(TLM) area; and one, Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654), is located east of the HGB area, 
between the HGB area and the BPA area.  Each of these monitors was selected for specific 
purposes.  West Orange (CAMS 9) and Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) were 
chosen because they are as close as possible to the Texas border and, thus, are useful for isolating 
background ozone being transported into the state from the east.  Karnack (CAMS 85), in 
northeast Texas, is also very near the Texas border, and was selected to provide an assessment of 
background ozone transport from more northerly regions.  The final site, Hamshire (CAMS 
64/CAMS 654), was selected to aid stratification of background ozone being transported into the 
HGB area into a component originating outside the state, and a component contributed by the 
BPA area.

Source:  TCEQ/LEADS database.  Data with wind speeds less than 3 miles per hour were 
excluded to minimize influences from periods of stagnation which may result in over estimation 
of background concentrations. 
 
To isolate ozone being transported into the state, measurements at the selected monitors were 
restricted by wind direction.  The West Orange (CAMS 9) monitor is located less than 3 miles 
from the Louisiana border but is near several industrial sites.  Only ozone measurements taken 
when winds originated from directions ranging from 30° to 90° (Figure 5-39:  Mauriceville 
C642/C311/C665) and West Orange (C9) Monitors) were considered, to minimize possible 
influence from these sources. Thirty degrees corresponds to a north-northeast direction and 90o is 
due east.  The Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) monitor is located ten miles 
from the Louisiana border, north of the West Orange (CAMS 9) monitor.  This site may have 
some minor influence from relatively small NOX and VOC sources.  Data from this monitor was 
restricted to wind directions originating from 30° to 90°, similarly to West Orange (CAMS 9), to 
minimize any possible influence of nearby point sources. 
 
The Karnack (CAMS 85) monitor in the TLM area is located eight miles from the Texas-
Louisiana border, and roughly 20 miles from Arkansas.  Measurements from Karnack (CAMS 
85) were restricted to wind directions originating from 30° to 135° (Figure 5-40:  Karnack 
C85Monitor), that is, from north-northeast clockwise to southeast.  Though this site is not near 

 
 
5-74
the HGB area, it records large influxes of continental air transported from the Midwestern United 
States into Texas, which ultimately may raise background ozone concentrations throughout the 
state.  Also, estimates of background ozone concentrations from Karnack (CAMS 85) can be 
compared to background estimates from West Orange (CAMS 9) and Mauriceville (CAMS 
642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665), which is useful for corroborating estimates at these two sites, and 
determining the range of background ozone entering the state. 
 
The final site under consideration is Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654), located between the HGB 
area and the BPA area.  Ozone measurements from this site can be used to estimate background 
ozone concentrations transported to the HGB area when winds are from the east.  These 
background ozone measurements are a combination of pollution transported into Texas, as well as 
the contribution of pollution from the BPA area.  To avoid undue influence of nearby industrial 
sites, similar to Karnack (CAMS 85), data from Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654) are restricted 
to measurements obtained when winds originate from directions ranging from 30° to 135°.  For 
the four monitors, monthly 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th   percentiles of hourly ozone 
concentrations were calculated for the spring and summer ozone season, May through September, 
2000 through 2008, except Karnack (CAMS 85) which only has data since 2001.  These values 
are plotted in Figure 5-42:  Selected Statistics for the West Orange C9 Monitor, Figure 5-43:  
Selected Statistics for the Mauriceville C642/C311/C665 Monitor, Figure 5-44:  Selected 
Statistics for the Karnack C85 Monitor, and Figure 5-45:  Selected Statistics for the Hamshire 
C64/C654 Monitor.  Ninetieth percentile values are reported in Table 5-25:  Range of Monthly 
90th Percentile Daily Peak Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Subject Wind Directions.

Note:  Though data has been restricted by wind direction to mitigate influences 
from nearby pollution sources, there may be unknown influences that are 
unaccounted for.  Maximum values for each year are highlighted in boldface 
type. 
 
 
To statistically verify whether a trend across time exists in the data, an index of date was fit to the 
daily peak values using ordinary least squares regression.  Additional regressions were performed 
using an index of month against the selected percentiles of the monthly distributions.  The 
resulting parameter estimates from these models revealed no statistically significant trend at the 5 
percent significance level; however, the data likely suffer from autocorrelation, a problem 
common to time series data.  Time series data are often not independent, but correlated with 
themselves across time, which complicates formal statistical estimation by biasing parameter 
estimates. 
 
Rather than performing the procedures necessary to detect, measure, and correct for 
autocorrelation, a careful visual inspection of time series plots, presented in Figure 5-42:  Selected 
Statistics for the West Orange C9 Monitor through Figure 5-45:  Selected Statistics for the 
Hamshire C64/C654 Monitor, satisfies that no time trend is perceptible.  These four figures plot 
the five selected percentiles of the monthly distributions at each monitor.  While no trend is 
detectable, what is apparent is that ozone concentrations measured at these monitors, which have 
been restricted in such a way as to proxy background levels, vary substantially.  Background 
ozone at these monitors varies as much as 35 ppb, due to meteorological effects and ozone 
dynamics occurring in upwind regions. 
 
Notable in Figure 5-45:  Selected Statistics for the Hamshire C64/C654 Monitor, hourly ozone 
concentrations at Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654) behave similarly to West Orange (CAMS 9) 
and Karnack (CAMS 85), in that there is no observable or statistically significant trend of the 
median or 90th percentile values.  The 90th percentile value at Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654), 
considering directionally restricted data for May to September, 2000 through 2008, is 59 ppb.  
This value is in the range of values computed by Nielson-Gammon using different procedures; 
however, the 90th percentile can exceed 80 ppb at any of the sites, and even exceeded 90 ppb at 
Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) in 2000.  TexAQS II also found background 

 
 
5-78
ozone concentrations that exceed the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS (TexAQS II Rapid Science 
Synthesis Team 2006). 
 
Over the 2000 through 2008 period, the maximum 90th percentile one-hour ozone concentrations 
at West Orange (CAMS 9) and Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) are 79 and 92, 
respectively.  The maximum 90th percentile for Karnack (CAMS 85) over the 2001 through 2008 
period is 81.  Karnack (CAMS 85) appears to consistently measure a higher background than 
either West Orange (CAMS 9) or Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665).  These 
results are consistent with estimates reported by Nielson-Gammon, et al. (2005), which also 
found higher background ozone concentrations during the ozone season in northeast Texas than 
in the HGB area. 
 
Regression analysis was used to determine whether the 90th percentile values at West Orange 
(CAMS 9) and Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) track one another, which 
suggests they are measuring roughly equivalent phenomena.  The resulting R2 of 0.78, which is 
significant at a probability level less than 0.1 percent (Table 5-26:  Parameter Estimates for 
Regression of West Orange C9 on Mauriceville C642/C311/C665, indicates very strong 
correlation between measurements at the two sites.  The scatter plot of the data is illustrated in 
Figure 5-46:  Scatter-plot of 90th Percentile Hourly Values at West Orange C9 and Mauriceville 
C642/C311/C665.  The values in the scatter plot are from May through September, 2000 to 2008.  
The scatter plot supports the contention that these two monitors are measuring roughly the same 
phenomena, under wind-restricted regimes.

In summary, none of the four sites used for estimating background ozone concentrations recorded 
a statistically significant trend.  The Karnack (CAMS 85) monitoring site recorded the highest 
90th percentile measurement of the four background sites, with 90th percentile ozone 
concentrations reaching as high as 63 ppb.  Since it is farthest from the HGB area, however, the 
HGB area may not be strongly affected by the ozone observed at this site, at least not on the same 
day.   
 
5.3.13  Air Quality Trends Conclusions 
Ozone concentrations have decreased dramatically in the HGB area since the 1990s.  
Examination of trends in one-hour ozone, eight-hour ozone, the number of exceedances, the 
spatial distribution of ozone, the seasonal distribution of ozone, and the strength of ozone 
gradients all show substantial downward trends.  The causes of the trends were investigated by 
examining the meteorological variations that have occurred over the years, by evaluating the local 
changes in ozone precursor concentrations, and by examining trends in background ozone.  The 
analyses found that the interannual meteorological variations cannot explain the observed 
decreases in ozone, and that the ozone precursors are on statistically significant downward trends.  
In addition, the analyses have found that background ozone has not dropped substantially since 
2000, suggesting that the significant ozone reductions in the HGB area are due to local emission 
controls, not due to background ozone decreases. 
 
5.4  QUALITATIVE CORROBORATIVE ANALYSIS 
5.4.1  Introduction 
Because photochemical modeling is an evaluation tool and not an absolute prediction of future 
ozone concentrations, additional data must be considered in order to draw conclusions about the 
validity of the final predicted design value and whether the attainment demonstration satisfies the 
requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA).  The EPA’s “Guidance on the Use of Models 

 
 
5-80
and Other Analyses for Demonstrating Attainment of Air Quality Goals for Ozone, PM2.5, and 
Regional Haze,” referenced as modeling guidance in Chapter 3, Photochemical Modeling 
acknowledges that many issues cannot be accurately quantified and therefore cannot be properly 
included in the photochemical modeling demonstration.  The qualitative corroborative analysis 
contains information regarding federal preemption issues and analysis of additional measures that 
were not included in the modeling. 
 
5.4.2  Federal Preemption Issues 
The TCEQ has limited authority to regulate certain components of the emissions inventory.  The 
federal government has jurisdiction over on-road and non-road vehicles, ships, locomotives, and 
aircraft, among other sources.  Since states cannot control sources that are under federal 
jurisdiction or located in other states, the state is limited in its ability to impose controls on all of 
the sources that contribute to ozone formation in a nonattainment area. 
 
5.4.2.1  Federal Assignment 
While these categories have been addressed through expeditiously implemented state incentive 
programs such as the Low Income Vehicle Repair Assistance, Retrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle 
Retirement Program (LIRAP) and the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP), future reductions 
are dependent on the prompt implementation of new federal engine and fuel standards for on-road 
and non-road vehicles, ships, locomotives, and aircraft. 
 
5.4.3  Additional Measures 
5.4.3.1  New International Marine Diesel Engine and Marine Fuel Standards for Oceangoing 
Vessels and Emissions Control Areas 
In October 2008, the United States ratified the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 
adoption of the amendments to Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of 
Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) for new international marine diesel engine and marine fuel 
standards for oceangoing vessels (OGV).  The new Annex VI Tier II and Tier III emission 
standards will apply to diesel engines with a power rating above 130 kilowatts (kW) (i.e., 175 
horsepower) installed on marine vessels constructed on or after January 1, 2011 (Tier II), and 
January 1, 2016 (Tier III), or diesel engines above 130 kW that undergo a major conversion on or 
after those dates.  The revised MARPOL Annex VI will become effective on July 1, 2010. 
 
In March 2009, the United States submitted a request to the IMO for the creation of an emissions 
control area (ECA) around the nation's coastlines.  If the ECA is granted, all marine diesel fuels 
used by OGV in the ECA will be limited to a maximum sulfur content of 1,000 ppm beginning 
January 1, 2015, and all new engines on OGV operating in these areas must use emission controls 
that achieve an 80 percent reduction in NOX emissions beginning January 1, 2016.  Table 5-27:  
New MARPOL Annex VI Emission Standards for Marine Diesel Engines lists the new emission 
standards for marine diesel engines with greater than 30 liter per cylinder displacement.

Note:  NOX emission standards presented in grams per kilowatt hour.   
 
In the August 28, 2009, issue of the Federal Register (74 FR 44442), the EPA proposed 
rulemaking to adopt new federal Tier 2 and Tier 3 engine standards for new marine engines above 
30 liters per cylinder displacement (i.e., Category 3 marine diesel engines) that are consistent 
with the new MARPOL Annex VI NOX emission standards shown in Table 5-27:  New MARPOL 
Annex VI Emission Standards for Marine Diesel Engines.  The EPA's proposed new Category 3 
marine diesel engine standards also include new standards limiting the emissions of hydrocarbons 
and carbon monoxide from new Tier 2 and later Category 3 engines to 2.0 g/kW-hr and 5.0 
g/kW-hr, respectfully.   
 
The EPA regulations for marine diesel fuel and new marine engines less than 30 liters per 
cylinder displacement and the new MARPOL Annex VI standards for marine residual fuels and 
new marine diesel engines above 30 liters per cylinder displacement will apply to all OGV 
flagged and registered in the United States.  The EPA's proposed new regulations for new 
Category 3 marine engines and new sulfur limits for marine diesel fuel will also apply to all OGV 
flagged and registered in the United States.  In addition, the new MARPOL Annex VI standards 
will apply to all new marine diesel engines and fuels on foreign marine vessels that operate near 
United States coasts and ports.  
 
The new marine diesel engine and fuel standards will provide a 96 percent reduction in sulfur in 
marine diesel fuels, as well as an 85 percent reduction in particulate matter emissions and an 80 
percent reduction in NOX emissions, when compared to current standards (EPA, 2009a, 
http://www.epa.gov/otaq/oceanvessels.htm#emissioncontrol).  The cumulative effects of these 
new marine diesel engine and fuels standards will result in a 0.5 to 1.0 ppb reduction of ozone in 
the ambient air of the HGB ozone nonattainment area by 2020 (EPA, 2009b). 
 
5.4.3.2  SmartWay Transport Partnership and the Blue Skyways Collaborative 
Among its various efforts to improve air quality in Texas, the TCEQ is currently promoting two 
voluntary programs in cooperation with the EPA:  the SmartWay Transport Partnership and the 
Blue Skyways Collaborative. 
 
The SmartWay Transport Partnership is a voluntary EPA program for the freight transport 
industry that promotes strategies and technologies to help improve fleet efficiency while also 
reducing air emissions.  Fleets participating in the SmartWay Transport Partnership commit to 
implementing voluntary measures over three years, providing the EPA with annual updates of 
their progress throughout that period.  
 
SmartWay carriers typically commit to integrating fuel-saving strategies and technologies into 
their fleet including:  improved aerodynamics, single-wide tires, lighter wheels and rims, idle 
reduction, automatic tire inflation systems, driver training, and advanced powertrain technologies.   
 

 
 
5-82
Rolling resistance is estimated by the EPA to account for as much as 13 percent of a heavy-duty 
vehicle’s fuel consumption.  By reducing rolling resistance, as well as vehicle weight, the EPA 
believes that single-wide tires will help to improve fuel economy and reduce NOX emissions by 
an average of 5 percent.   Aerodynamic drag accounts for most of a long-haul truck’s energy 
losses at highway speeds.  As a result, the EPA estimates that improving the aerodynamics of 
both a long-haul truck and its trailer can help to improve fuel economy and reduce NOX 
emissions by another 5 percent.   
 
The extended periods of idling typically associated with long-haul trucks consume an average of 
one gallon of fuel per hour, while generating associated emissions.  New technologies such as 
auxiliary power units (APU) and truck stop electrification (TSE) systems reduce vehicle idling by 
providing power for air conditioning, heating, and onboard electrical accessories, even when the 
vehicle is not in operation.   The EPA estimates that, assuming typical idling levels, idling 
reduction technologies such as APU and TSE can reduce NOX emissions by approximately 10 
percent. 
 
The transient nature of freight transportation makes it difficult to isolate emissions reductions to a 
certain region or even a certain state.  As a result, any estimates of the impact of these 
technologies will largely rely on estimates of accumulated reductions based on estimated levels of 
overall fleet integration.  These estimates are possible through ongoing research, and in 
conjunction with the more than 2,000 companies nationwide already committed as SmartWay 
partners, the EPA has identified a variety of technologies and the potential fuel savings and 
emissions reductions from those technologies.  There are 87 Texas companies that are currently 
SmartWay partners. 
 
The Blue Skyways Collaborative is a related effort, spearheaded by the EPA Region 6 office in 
Dallas, Texas and the Region 7 office in Kansas City, Missouri.   
 
Partnering with the EPA Region 6 and Region 7 through this effort are the environmental and 
energy agencies from the 10 states along the Interstate Highway 35 (IH-35) corridor, including 
Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, and 
Minnesota.  In implementing the Blue Skyways Collaborative, the EPA and the participating 
states recognize that because air quality is often a regional concern, greater reductions are 
possible through cooperative efforts as opposed to individual efforts initiated independently in 
each state.   
 
The primary objective of the Blue Skyways Collaborative is to improve air quality in these states 
by promoting innovative technologies in a variety of sectors.  In addition to promoting reduction 
strategies through the SmartWay Partnership for freight transportation via air, water, and rail, 
Blue Skyways also focuses on promoting emissions reduction strategies for other on-road 
sources, non-road sources, and highway fueling and idling reduction infrastructure, while also 
promoting renewable, efficient, and alternative energy sources.   
 
To achieve these objectives, the collaborative develops partnerships among international, federal, 
state, and local governments, as well as non-profit organizations, environmental groups, and 
private industries.  These partnerships work together in projects along the key transportation 
corridors by sharing emission reduction technologies and leveraging financial resources from a 
variety of sources.

5.4.3.3  Control of VOC Emissions from Flash Emissions 
When the TCEQ and its research partners began the second Texas air quality study, TexAQS II, 
in May 2005, one of the study’s primary goals was to identify VOC emission sources that have 
been historically underestimated, unreported, or underreported in the TCEQ emissions inventory 
and could potentially be contributing to a discrepancy between measured and reported emissions.  
TexAQS II remote sensing VOC project results indicate that certain types of storage tank 
emissions, including flash, generally have been underestimated, unreported, or underreported in 
the emission inventory.  Flash emissions occur when a liquid with entrained gases goes from a 
high pressure to a low pressure.  As the pressure on the liquid drops, some of the lighter VOC 
dissolved in the liquid are released or flashed.  Compounds that are liquids at the initial pressure 
may transform from a liquid into a vapor and are also released from the liquid.  As these gases are 
released, some of the heavier compounds in the liquids may become entrained in these gases and 
are emitted with the lighter VOC. 
 
In May 2007, the commission adopted rule amendments to 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 
Chapter 115, Subchapter B, Division 1 that revised the requirements for VOC storage tanks 
located in the HGB ozone nonattainment area. The revised requirements were developed to 
reduce VOC emissions that result from uncontrolled flash emissions at upstream oil and gas 
exploration and production sites and other sources of tank emissions.  At the time of the rule 
proposal, the amount of flash emissions from minor sources was unknown.    
 
A method for quantifying flash emissions became available around the same time.  Houston 
Advanced Research Center Project 51C, conducted in 2006, quantified emission rates from 
heater-treaters (separators) and storage tank batteries, including flash and condensate tanks, 
associated with the upstream oil and gas industry in the Dallas-Fort Worth and HGB ozone 
nonattainment areas, and Jefferson County.  In April 2007, the TCEQ used the results of this 
study to determine the flash emissions from the oil and gas production industry.  However, the 
flash emissions were not included in the 2005 area source periodic emissions inventory (PEI) 
because there was not sufficient time to incorporate the emissions before the 2005 area source 
PEI was submitted to the EPA in May 2007.  However, the updated 2005 area source emissions 
inventory is being used for this SIP revision.  More information on this study can be found at: 
http://www.harc.edu/Projects/AirQuality/Projects/Projects/H051C. 
 
The rule amendments adopted in May 2007 resulted in actual reductions to flash emissions but no 
credit is claimed in this SIP revision.  Crude and condensate storage tanks at upstream oil and gas 
exploration and production sites or midstream pipeline breakout stations with uncontrolled flash 
emissions greater than 25 tons per year (tpy) are controlled under the rule.  Since the method of 
calculating the emissions was based on county-level production, it is unknown at this time how 
many sites were over 25 tpy and were required to put on controls.  Also unknown is how much 
flash emissions were already controlled due to economic reasons.  Because of the unknown total 
effect of this rule, the reduction in flash emissions cannot be quantified at this time and is not 
included in the modeling for this SIP revision.  These amendments to Chapter 115 are described 
in more detail in the preamble of the adopted rule (Project Number 2006-038-115-EN). 
 
5.4.3.4  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE/RE) Measures 
Energy efficiency efforts are typically programs that reduce the amount of electricity and natural 
gas consumed by residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal energy consumers.  Examples 
of energy efficiency include increasing insulation in homes, installing compact fluorescent light 
bulbs, and replacing motors and pumps with high efficiency units.  Renewable energy efforts 
include programs that generate energy from resources that are replenished or are otherwise not 
consumed as with traditional fuel-based energy production.  Examples of renewable energy 
include wind energy and solar energy projects. 
 

 
 
5-84
The Texas Legislature has enacted a number of EE/RE measures and programs.  The following is 
a summary of Texas EE/RE legislation since 1999. 
 
• 
76th Texas Legislature, 1999 
o Senate Bill (SB) 7 (Regular Session) 
o House Bill (HB) 2492 (Regular Session) 
o HB 2960 (Regular Session) 
• 
77th Texas Legislature, 2001 
o SB 5 (Regular Session) 
o HB 2277 (Regular Session) 
o HB 2278 (Regular Session) 
o HB 2845 (Regular Session) 
• 
78th Texas Legislature, 2003  
o HB1365 (Regular Session) 
• 
79th Texas Legislature, 2005  
o SB 20 (First Call Session) 
o HB 2129 (Regular Session) 
o HB 2481 (Regular Session) 
•

o HB 66 (Regular Session) 
o HB 3070 (Regular Session) 
o HB 3693 (Regular Session) 
o SB 12 (Regular Session) 
 
SB 5, 77th Texas Legislature, 2001, set goals for political subdivisions in affected counties to 
implement measures to reduce energy consumption from existing facilities by 5 percent each year 
for five years from January 1, 2002 through January 1, 2006.  In 2007, the 80th Texas Legislature 
passed SB 12, which extended the timeline set in SB 5 through 2007 and made the 5 percent each 
year a goal instead of a requirement.  The State Energy Conservation Office (SECO) is charged 
with tracking the implementation of SB 5 and SB 12.  Also during the 77th Texas Legislature, the 
Energy Systems Laboratory (ESL), part of the Texas Engineering Experiment Station, Texas 
A&M University System, was mandated to provide an annual report on EE/RE efforts in the state 
as part of the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP) under Texas Health and Safety Code 
(THSC), § 388.003(e).  HB 2129, 79th Texas Legislature, 2005, directed the ESL to collaborate 
with the TCEQ to develop a methodology for computing emission reductions attributable to use 
of renewable energy and for the ESL to quantify annually such emission reductions.  HB 2129 
directed the Texas Environmental Research Consortium to use the Texas Engineering Experiment 
Station to develop this methodology.  With the TCEQ’s guidance, the ESL produces an annual 
report detailing these efforts (Statewide Air Emissions Calculations from Energy Efficiency, Wind 
and Renewables).  The report: 
 
• 
analyzes power production from wind and other renewable energy sources;   
• 
provides quantification of energy savings and NOX reductions resulting from the 
installation of wind and other renewable energy sources; 
• 
describes methodologies developed to quantify energy savings and NOX reductions from 
energy efficiency, wind and other renewable energy initiatives; and 
• 
provides degradation analysis for future predictions of power production of wind farms. 
 
The ESL documents methods used to develop estimates of energy savings and NOX emissions 
reductions resulting from reductions in natural gas consumption and displaced power from 
conventional electric generation facilities.  The ESL used the EPA’s Emissions and Generation 
Resource Integrated Database to spatially allocate energy use and emission reductions among 
electric generation facilities.  The THSC, § 389.002 and § 389.003 contain requirements that the 
Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), SECO, and the ESL report to the TCEQ all 

 
 
5-85
emission reductions resulting from EE/RE projects in Texas.  The ESL analyzed the following 
areas/programs: 
 
Renewable Energies 
The 79th Texas Legislature, 2005, amended SB 5 through SB 20, HB 2129, and HB 2481 to add, 
among other initiatives, the following renewable energy initiatives, which require:  5,880 
megawatts of generating capacity from renewable energy by 2015; the TCEQ to develop a 
methodology for calculating emission reductions from renewable energy initiatives and 
associated credits; the ESL to assist the TCEQ in quantifying emissions reductions from EE/RE 
programs; and  the PUCT to establish a target of 10,000 megawatts of installed renewable 
technologies by 2025. 
 
Residential Building Codes and Programs 
The THSC, Chapter 388, Texas Building Energy Performance Standards, as adopted by the 77th 
Texas Legislature, 2001, states in § 388.003(a) that single-family residential construction must 
meet the energy efficiency performance standards established in the energy efficiency chapter of 
the International Residential Code.  The Furnace Pilot Light Program includes energy savings 
accomplished by retrofitting existing furnaces.  Also included are Seasonal Energy Efficiency 
Ratio (SEER) 13 upgrades to single-family and multi-family buildings.  In January 2006, federal 
regulations mandated that the minimum efficiency for residential air conditioners be increased 
from SEER 10 to SEER 13. 
 
Commercial Building Codes 
The THSC, Chapter 388, Texas Building Energy Performance Standards, as adopted by the 77th 
Texas Legislature, 2001, states in § 388.003(b) that all other residential, commercial, and 
industrial construction must meet the energy efficiency performance standards established in the 
energy efficiency chapter of the International Energy Conservation Code. 
 
Federal Facilities EE/RE Projects 
Federal facilities are required to reduce energy use by Presidential Executive Order 13123 and the 
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58 EPACT20065).  The ESL compiled energy 
reductions data for the federal EE/RE projects in Texas. 
 
Political Subdivisions Projects 
SECO funds loans for energy-efficiency projects for state agencies, institutions of higher 
education, school districts, county hospitals, and local governments.  Political subdivisions in 
nonattainment and affected counties are required by SB 5 to report EE/RE projects to SECO.  
These projects are typically building systems retrofits, nonbuilding lighting projects, and other 
mechanical and electrical systems retrofits such as municipal water and waste water treatment 
systems.   
 
Electric Utility Sponsored Programs 
Utilities are required by SB 7, 76th Texas Legislature, 1999, and SB 5, 77th Texas Legislature, 
2001, to report these projects to the PUCT.  See THSC, § 386.205 and Texas Utilities Code,  
§ 39.905.  These projects are typically air conditioner replacements, ventilation duct tightening, 
and commercial and industrial equipment replacement. 
 
In addition to the programs discussed and analyzed in the ESL report, local governments may 
have enacted measures beyond what has been reported to SECO and the PUCT.  The TCEQ 
encourages local political subdivisions to promote EE/RE measures in their respective 
communities and to ensure these measures are fully reported to SECO and the PUCT. 
 
HB 3693, 80th Texas Legislature, 2007, amended the Texas Education Code, Texas Government 
Code, THSC, and Texas Utilities Code.  The bill: 

 
 
5-86
 
• 
requires state agencies, universities and local governments to adopt energy efficiency 
programs; 
• 
provides additional incentives for electric utilities to expand energy conservation and 
efficiency programs; 
• 
includes municipal-owned utilities and cooperatives in efficiency programs; 
• 
increases incentives and provides consumer education to improve efficiency programs; 
and 
• 
supports other programs such as revision of building codes and research into alternative 
technology and renewable energies. 
 
Emissions reductions as a result of the above programs were not explicitly included in the 
photochemical modeling because local efficiency efforts may not result in local emissions 
reductions or may be offset by increased demand in electricity.  The complex nature of the 
electrical grid also makes accurately quantifying emission reductions from EE/RE projects 
difficult.  At any given time, it is impossible to determine exactly where on the electrical grid 
electricity comes from for any certain electrical user.  The electricity for a user could be from a 
power plant in west Texas, a nearby attainment county or from within the nonattainment area.  If 
electrical demand is reduced in the HGB area due to these kinds of measures, then emission 
reductions from power generation facilities may occur in any number of locations around the 
state. 
 
5.4.3.5  Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) 
The EPA projects that CAIR regional controls will improve air quality in the HGB area, as well 
as most of Texas, according to EPA’s Texas CAIR Web page, http://www.epa.gov/cair/tx.html. 
 
Under CAIR, 28 eastern states (plus the District of Columbia) are required to comply with a cap 
on sulfur dioxide (SO2) and NOX for EGU emissions.  The definition of an EGU for the CAIR 
program is approximately the same definition as that for an FCAA Title IV Acid Rain unit (i.e., 
larger than 25 megawatt (MW) and more than one-third of its generation going to the public grid 
for sale).  CAIR is a cap and trade program, with each of the CAIR-applicable states given a 
calculated NOX budget and a calculated SO2 budget by the EPA.  The EPA modeled all of these 
states in order to test the effectiveness of controls.  A result of EPA’s CAIR modeling was that 
Texas “significantly contributed” to the nonattainment of the particulate matter of 2.5 microns 
and less (PM2.5) standard of two counties in Illinois, therefore, Texas was included in CAIR for 
the transport of PM2.5.  Texas is not covered under the CAIR program for 1997 eight-hour ozone 
standard contribution. 
 
CAIR is implemented in two phases:  for NOX, Phase I covers the years 2009 through 2014 and 
Phase II is for the years 2015 and later; for SO2, Phase I covers the years 2010 through 2014 and 
Phase II is for the years 2015 and later.  The Phase I NOX budget calculated and assigned to Texas 
was 181,014 tons per year, and the Phase II NOX budget was 150,845.  Because 2018 is the HGB 
ozone attainment year, this SIP revision incorporates CAIR Phase II (post 2014 step-down of 
CAIR) which provides for a Texas state-wide NOX budget of 150,845 tons per year, or 413.3 tons 
per day. 
 
See Appendix B:  Emissions Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP, Section 
2.3.1.2.1 for the procedural details that the TCEQ used to simulate CAIR Phase II in Texas and 
the regional states. 
 
On July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit (Court) (No. 
05-1244) vacated CAIR and the CAIR Federal Implementation Plan (FIP).  On December 23, 
2008, the Court issued a revised opinion to remand, without vacating, CAIR to the EPA.  
Therefore, CAIR will remain in effect while the EPA analyzes data and conducts rulemaking to 

 
 
5-87
modify the program to comply with the Court’s July 2008 opinion.  The Court declined to impose 
a schedule by which the EPA must complete the rulemaking, but reminded the EPA that the 
Court does “. . . not intend to grant an indefinite stay of the effectiveness of this Court’s 
decision.”  For more information on the ruling, see EPA’s CAIR Web page, 
http://www.epa.gov/cair/, or the TCEQ CAIR/CAMR Web page, 
 http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/sip/caircamr.html. 
 
Any future EPA revision to the CAIR program to comply with the court’s ruling may result in 
additional reductions. 
 
5.4.3.6  Texas Emission Reduction Plan (TERP) 
The TERP program was created in 2001 by the 77th Texas Legislature to provide grants to offset 
the incremental costs associated with reducing NOX emissions from high-emitting internal 
combustion engines.  To date the TERP program has funded over $700 million in grants for 
projects in Texas ozone nonattainment and near-nonattainment areas.  Over $300 million of that 
amount has been awarded to projects in the HGB area since 2001, which will help reduce more 
than 66,000 tons of NOX emissions.  Of that $300 million, $5 million was awarded to the H-GAC 
through a third-party grant to administer additional grants in the HGB area. 
 
Additional funds are expected to be awarded to the HGB area in subsequent grant application 
periods that will result in further NOX reductions.  HB 1796, 81st Texas Legislature, 2009, 
extended the TERP program beyond its current 2013 date to 2019, which will result in continued 
reductions in the significant emissions source categories of on-road and non-road engines. 
 
5.4.3.7  Low Income Vehicle Repair Assistance, Retrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle Retirement 
Program (LIRAP) 
SB 12, 80th Texas Legislature, 2007, enhanced LIRAP to expand participation by increasing the 
income eligibility to 300 percent of the federal poverty rate and increasing the amount of 
assistance toward the replacement of a retired vehicle.  The program, known as AirCheckTexas 
Drive a Clean Machine (DACM), provides $3,500 for hybrids of the current or previous model 
year; $3,000 for cars of the current or three model years; and, $3,000 for trucks of the current or 
previous two model years.  The retired vehicle must be 10 years or older or have failed an 
emissions test.  In the HGB area, DACM is available to vehicle owners in five counties:  
Brazoria, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, and Montgomery.  Between December 2007 and May 31, 
2009, LIRAP/DACM has retired and replaced 9,330 vehicles at a cost of $28,370,520.  An 
additional 3,949 vehicles have had emissions-related repairs at a cost of $2,136,602.  The total 
repair and retirement/replacement funding for the HGB area since December 2007 is 
$30,507,122. 
 
5.4.3.8  Clean School Bus Program 
HB 3469, 79th Texas Legislature, 2005, established the Clean School Bus Program.  The new 
program is codified in THSC, Chapter 390 and implemented through 30 TAC §§ 114.640 – 
114.648. 
 
The program is based on the EPA guidance documents, Improving Air Quality with Economic 
Incentive Programs (EPA-452/R-01-001) and Diesel Retrofits:  Quantifying and Using Their 
Benefits in SIPs and Conformity (EPA-420-B-06-005).  Under the economic incentive program 
guidance, the TCEQ is using the financial mechanism option, which is described as subsidies 
targeted at promoting pollution-reducing activities or products.   
 
The Clean School Bus Program was established to provide monetary incentives for school 
districts in the state for reducing emissions of diesel exhaust in school buses.  Eligible 
technologies include those approved by the EPA, certified by the California Air Resources Board, 
or those that the executive director finds will bring about significant emissions reductions.  Some 

 
 
5-88
of the technologies eligible for funding under the program reduce NOX emissions.  However, the 
technologies mainly reduce particulate matter and reduce only negligible amounts of NOX.  The 
80th Texas Legislature, 2007, provided funding for the Clean School Bus Program. 
 
As of May 2009, the TCEQ Clean School Bus grant program has allocated $13.8 million in grants 
for nearly 5,000 school buses in Texas.  In addition, through Supplemental Environmental 
Projects (SEPs), the TCEQ has also allocated over $3.5 million to third-party SEP receivers for 
the same kind of school bus retrofits. 
 
5.4.3.9  81st Texas Legislature, 2009 
HB 432 requires state agencies that purchase passenger vehicles or other ground transportation 
vehicles for general use to ensure that not less than 25 percent of new vehicles purchased during a 
biennium meet or exceed EPA’s Tier II, Bin 3 emission standards.  This bill also limits the 
purchase of state agency passenger vehicles or other ground transportation vehicles purchased for 
general use to only those vehicles that use compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied 
petroleum gas, methanol or methanol/gasoline blends of 85 percent or greater, ethanol or 
ethanol/gasoline blends of 85 percent or greater, biodiesel or biodiesel/diesel blends of 20 percent 
or greater, or electricity, including electricity to power a plug-in hybrid motor vehicle. 
 
HB 1796 establishes a New Technology Implementation Grants (NTIG) program for facilities 
and stationary sources under TERP, requires the current New Technology Research and 
Development under TERP to be administered by the TCEQ, and extends the TERP to August 31, 
2019.  See Section 5.4.3.6, Texas Emission Reduction Plan (TERP), for additional information. 
 
SB 1759 establishes a Texas Clean Fleet Program to be administered by the TCEQ, funding it 
with 5 percent of the 87.5 percent of the Emission Reduction Incentives Grant within TERP.  The 
Texas Clean Fleet Program will provide grants to encourage large fleets to replace diesel-
powered fleet vehicles with hybrid vehicles or alternative fuel-powered vehicles. 
 
5.4.3.10  American Waterways Operators Tank Barge Emissions Best Management Practices 
 
Using infrared gas imaging technology in field studies conducted in the summer of 2005, the 
TCEQ detected inadvertent VOC emissions from tank barges operating in the HGB area.  The 
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) also detected inadvertent emissions 
from tank barges in similar field studies conducted in the same time period.  In response to these 
field studies, the American Waterways Operators (AWO) voluntarily developed industry Best 
Management Practices (BMP) to reduce VOC emissions from tank barges.  The BMP includes 
procedures to reduce VOC emissions from equipment and operations on tank barges.  The 
recommendations are a combination of inspection, corrective action, preventative maintenance, 
operational, procedural, and training practices. 
 
The BMP was reviewed by the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC), United 
States Coast Guard, LDEQ, and TCEQ.  The BMP was distributed to AWO members in 2006 for 
implementation on a voluntary basis.  In 2009, AWO reconvened the Tank Barge Emissions 
Working Group to review the BMP and make further improvements to the document.  The 
improved BMP will be sent to CTAC, the Coast Guard, LDEQ, and TCEQ for review once it has 
been finalized by industry.  While the BMP is a voluntary measure and does not impose an 
enforceable commitment on AWO members, the implementation of the BMP, where applicable, 
may contribute to reducing inadvertent VOC emissions from barges during dock operations and 
during transit, which will help improve the air quality in the HGB area.  A copy of the 2006 BMP 
document is provided in Appendix J:  Recommendations for Best Management Practices to 
Control and Reduce Inadvertent Cargo Vapor Emissions in the Tank Barge Community. 
 

 
 
5-89
5.4.3.11  Local Initiative Projects 
SB 12, 80th Texas Legislature, 2007, allowed the use of unexpended LIRAP funds to be used for 
Local Initiative Projects.  These projects provide funding to LIRAP-participating counties for 
implementation of air quality improvement strategies through local projects and initiatives.  Local 
Initiative Projects may include: 
 
• 
expand and enhance the repair and replacement program; 
• 
develop and implement programs to remotely determine vehicle emissions and notify the 
vehicle’s operator; 
• 
develop and implement projects for coordinating with local law enforcement officials to 
reduce the use of counterfeit state inspection stickers; 
• 
develop and implement programs to enhance transportation system improvements; or 
• 
develop and implement new air control strategies designed to assist local areas in complying 
with state and federal air quality rules and regulations. 
 
5.4.3.12  Other Local Programs 
The Houston-Galveston Area Council submitted the following programs, which were not 
committed to as Transportation Control Measures or Voluntary Mobile Emission Reduction 
Program measures, but may be implemented locally in the HGB area.  For a detailed analysis of 
these programs, see Appendix F:  Evaluation of Mobile Source Control Strategies for the 
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria State Implementation Plan (prepared by ENVIRON for the 
Houston-Galveston Area Council). 
 
Scrappage and Buy-Back Plan 
This measure would build on the existing LIRAP, implemented as part of the AirCheckTexas 
Vehicle Emissions Testing program, by increasing the number of on-road light-duty gasoline 
vehicles scrapped.  The plan would also make separate funds available to help with the purchase 
of new on-road heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDV) to replace old, highly polluting vehicles. 
 
Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance 
Pay-As-You-Drive Vehicle Insurance, also called Distance-Based Vehicle Insurance and 
Mileage-Based Insurance, is a program that allows a vehicle’s insurance premiums to be based 
directly on how many miles the vehicle is driven during the policy term.  Currently, vehicle 
insurance is structured where high-mileage drivers are, in essence, subsidized by low-mileage 
drivers since all drivers are charged the same premiums after accounting for driving history 
related to collisions and traffic violations. 
 
Limitations on Idling of Heavy-Duty Vehicles; Creation of Regional Government Idling 
Restrictions 
Idling of vehicles is inherently an inefficient operation that can produce unwanted air pollutants.  
Idling also occurs during normal driving and other operations such as when the engine powers 
necessary accessories, known as power take-off, including man-lifts or concrete tumblers.  It is 
not possible to eliminate all idling, but idle reduction programs are typically low in cost and may 
result in a net savings to the owner/operator of the vehicle while also reducing air emissions. 
 
Encourage/Mandate Livable Centers 
The EPA developed the Smart Growth Implementation Assistance (SGIA) program in response to 
communities' requests for help achieving their development goals.  Through this program, the 
EPA provides technical assistance from private-sector experts to help communities find the best 
tools and resources for planning growth in ways that sustain environmental and economic 
progress and create a high quality of life.  The Gulf Coast Institute, Main Street Coalition, and 
Texas A&M partnered to apply for and received an SGIA grant in 2006.  While the City of 
Houston is not participating in the SGIA program at this time, the area has expressed interest in 
evaluating the potential effects of these measures on travel activity and emissions. 

 
 
5-90
 
Enhanced Enforcement of Smoking Vehicles 
This measure would encourage local law enforcement officers to enforce existing smoking 
vehicle laws and enable the emissions inspection status of smoking vehicles to be checked.  
Owners of smoking vehicles displaying a valid inspection sticker would be fined.  Smoking 
vehicles not having a valid inspection sticker would be impounded if the sticker were found to be 
fraudulent. 
 
Limitation on Idling of Heavy-Duty Construction Equipment 
Idling is an inefficient use of equipment in general and generates unnecessary emissions.  Idling 
however cannot be avoided in all cases, such as during normal work, when work is performed 
intermittently, and when the time to restart the engine would be considered a significant delay.  
This measure would seek to limit excessive idling when equipment is not required immediately.  
Suggested periods for limiting idling could be as little as 15 minutes maximum.  Many on-road 
trucks have factory-installed engine shutdown systems that automatically shut down the engine 
after a set period, or devices could be added to existing equipment.  To implement this measure, 
engine shutdown systems could be employed with idle timers set to a period that would not cause 
typical operational problems. Operator training could provide significant idle reduction perhaps 
beyond engine shutdown systems. 
 
5.5  CONCLUSIONS 
The TCEQ has employed several sophisticated technical tools to evaluate the past and present 
causes and effects of high ozone in the HGB area in an effort to predict the area’s future air 
quality.  Photochemical grid modeling has been performed and its performance has been 
rigorously evaluated.  Historical trends in ozone and ozone precursor concentrations and their 
causes have been investigated exhaustively.  The following conclusions can be reached from 
these evaluations.   
 
First, the photochemical grid modeling performs relatively well.  Problems observed with the 
modeling are those that are known to exist in all photochemical modeling exercises.  In spite of 
the known shortcomings, the model can be used carefully to predict ozone concentrations. The 
photochemical grid modeling predicts that the control strategy package chosen by the TCEQ can 
lower the ozone design values in the HGB area down to a value very near the 0.08 ppm eight-
hour ozone standard.  The dynamic model evaluations show that the model response to emission 
decreases is less than the response observed in the atmosphere, suggesting that the proposed 
emission controls are more likely to yield attainment of the eight-hour 0.08 ppm ozone standard 
than the absolute modeled design values indicate.  
 
Second, the ozone trend analyses show that ozone has decreased significantly since the late 
1990s.  Meteorological variations alone cannot explain the significant downward trend.  
Decreases in background ozone cannot explain the downward trend either.  Significant decreases 
in ozone precursors, however, coincide with the decreases in ozone, indicating that the ozone 
decreases observed in the HGB area are due to local emission controls.   
 
Third, many additional air quality improvement measures are being adopted in the HGB area that 
cannot be included in the photochemical modeling analysis because they cannot be accurately 
quantified. These additional measures can provide additional assurance that the HGB area is on 
the path toward attainment. 
 
Based upon the photochemical grid modeling results and these corroborative analyses, the weight 
of evidence indicates that the HGB area will attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard by June 
15, 2019.

CHAPTER 6:  ONGOING AND FUTURE INITIATIVES 
 
6.1  INTRODUCTION 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is committed to improving the air 
quality in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area and continues to work toward identifying 
and reducing ozone precursors.  Texas is investing resources into technological research and 
development for advancing pollution control technology, improving the science for ozone 
modeling and analysis, and refining quantification of volatile organic compound (VOC) 
emissions.  Refining quantification of VOC emissions benefits SIP planning by improving 
understanding of ozone formation.  Additionally, the TCEQ is working with the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), local area leaders, and the scientific community to 
identify new measures for reducing ozone precursors.  This chapter describes ongoing technical 
work that will be beneficial to improving air quality in Texas and the HGB area. 
 
6.2  ONGOING WORK 
6.2.1  Flare Task Force 
In November 2008, the TCEQ formed an agency-wide task force to comprehensively evaluate all 
aspects of flares in Texas.  The Flare Task Force is evaluating how flares factor into air quality 
challenges with an emphasis on air toxics and ozone.  Some of the specific issues under 
evaluation include:  different factors affecting flare performance, such as waste gas flow rates, 
turndown ratio, and waste gas to steam assist ratios; the adequacy of existing monitoring 
requirements for flares; and alternatives to flaring routine emissions.  A stakeholder group 
associated with the Flare Task Force has been formed to solicit comment on these issues related 
to flares.  A report for executive management is planned that will include options, considerations, 
and recommendations for improving our understanding and regulation of flares with the goal of 
improving air quality.  Additional information about the Flare Task Force is available at the 
stakeholder Web site: 
http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/rules/flare_stakeholder.html. 
 
6.2.2  Technologies for Detecting VOC 
6.2.2.1  Optical Gas Imaging Technology 
Optical gas imaging technology offers a unique technological advancement in pollution detection 
capability and has proved to be highly effective in the detection of VOC emissions.  An optical 
gas imaging system is a useful tool that assists the agency in actions such as facility 
investigations, reconnaissance investigations, mobile monitoring, and special projects.   This 
technology is also useful in identifying sources of VOC emissions that are underestimated, 
underreported, unreported, or previously unregulated.  The system also has the potential to 
advance leak detection and repair (LDAR) work practices and enable monitoring of components 
that are difficult to monitor with traditional LDAR methods.  However, the commission has 
technical and enforcement concerns associated with the potential regulatory implementation of 
this technology.  A standardized method or performance specification is necessary to ensure 
consistent and reliable application of optical gas imaging instrumentation.  Methods and 
specifications are also necessary to set minimum standards of performance to evaluate different 
potential technologies. 
 
The TCEQ uses the optical gas imaging technology as a screening tool in the following areas:  
offsite surveillance to identify potential sources of contaminants in response to ambient or other 
monitoring results; identification of sites, or areas with a specific site, where a focused 
investigation may be conducted; identification of potential source control strategies or to assist in 
an assessment of existing strategies; and identification of sources for emissions inventory issues. 
 
6.2.2.2  Open Path Sensing Technology 
Open path sensing technology allows specific pollutants to be monitored over a given distance 
(10 meters up to several kilometers) and generally provides very rapid measurements.  Some of 
these techniques, such as solar occulation flux (SOF), differential absorption lidar (DIAL), and 

 
6-2 
imaging differential optical absorption spectroscopy (I-DOAS) provide specific capabilities that 
include the ability to monitor air pollutants not only at ground level but also along a given path 
length in the sky, which allows measurements of specific elevated sources such as flares, vents, 
and storage tanks.  This information coupled with meteorological measurements and modeling 
tools are capable, in some cases, of providing emission estimates not otherwise available.  These 
data can be helpful in evaluating actual emissions from specific sources.  These measurement 
techniques also have limitations or challenges that include the following. 
 
• 
They are non-separatory techniques, i.e., do not physically isolate the chemical or 
chemicals of interest from other constituents, and as such are more prone to interference. 
• 
They normally measure a path length average concentration or number of molecules and 
as such do not provide a specific concentration at any given point and can thus be 
difficult to compare with standards or guideline concentrations. 
• 
They are difficult to assess from a data quality standpoint because they are an open path 
technology and thus have limitations for enforcement or compliance-related purposes. 
• 
They are complex instrumentation with limited commercial availability that requires a 
highly experienced operator and data analyst to obtain quality data.  In some cases, such 
as SOF and DIAL, there may be only a few operational instruments and qualified 
personnel in the world, which limits the ability of Texas to either acquire and operate the 
instrumentation or contract operation on anything but a sporadic basis. 
 
6.2.2.3  DIAL Remote Sensing Technology 
The TCEQ continued to advance the science of determining emissions from industrial sources by 
performing a five-week emissions monitoring study in the Texas City area during the summer of 
2007.   For the first time, a regulatory agency in the United States used a mobile DIAL remote 
sensing technology to measure emissions from industrial sources.  The study, funded by the EPA 
and the TCEQ, focused on gathering data from industrial sources that are difficult to measure 
using conventional sampling techniques.  The resulting scientific data and future studies will help 
guide future research efforts and may result in additional control measures, refined emissions 
models for common sources, and improved emissions inventories. 
 
The TCEQ contracted with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), based in the United 
Kingdom, to perform DIAL measurements on industrial emissions sources located in a refinery 
and a storage terminal near Houston during 2007. 
 
Measurements focused on those industrial sources that are difficult to measure using conventional 
sampling techniques.  Specifically, the study involved: 
 
• 
identifying potentially under-reported industrial emissions sources; 
• 
conducting remote sensing measurements of these sources; 
• 
collecting process and operational data from these sources; and 
• 
comparing emissions determined using conventional EPA-approved determination methods 
to the remote sensing measurements. 
 
The NPL submitted a draft report in February 2008, which is expected to be finalized in fall 2009.  
An independent third party is currently comparing remote sensing measurements to 
conventionally determined emissions.  Although these results are still being analyzed, preliminary 
total VOC measurements indicate that flare emissions may be underreported when emissions are 
determined using conventional material balance calculation methods.  Additionally, preliminary 
results as well as other research indicate flare destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) may be 
reduced during certain operating conditions, such as combusting small volumes of waste gas and 
during flare air- or steam-assist operations. 
 
These preliminary results indicate the need to conduct a study that determines the relationship 
between flare design, operation, and DRE.

6.2.2.4  Helicopter-Mounted DIAL Imaging System 
The TCEQ completed field work in June 2009 to demonstrate the capabilities of a helicopter-
mounted DIAL.  The study’s major focus will be using the DIAL to locate sources of benzene 
emissions from industrial facilities in the Houston Ship Channel area.  The DIAL system used 
was developed to detect methane leaks during flyovers of gas pipelines.  The system uses the 
infrared absorption of methane to detect leaks.  The system has been used extensively and 
successfully to find pipeline leaks in concentrations as low as 1.7 parts per million (ppm) of 
methane.  Instrument sensitivity has been shown in the laboratory to be approximately 100 ppm 
for benzene.  However, with tuning and adjustments during flight measurements, the benzene 
sensitivity could be as low as 10 ppm.  While the primary purpose of this project will be to 
determine the capabilities of a helicopter-mounted DIAL, results from this project could also be 
used to determine potentially unreported or underreported sources of benzene.  Successful 
location of benzene sources in the surveyed areas may show the potential benefit of a full-scale 
survey of the entire Houston Ship Channel as well as other industrial areas.  A final report is due 
to the agency by August 2009 and the agency final evaluation of the technology should be 
completed by the fall of 2009. 
 
6.2.2.5  Flare Study 
The purpose of the flare study is to measure flare emissions and collect required process and 
operational data in a controlled laboratory environment to determine the relationship between 
flare design, operation, and DRE.  Direct measurement techniques of flare emissions, 
conceptually similar to those employed by the EPA flare studies in the 1980s, as well as remote 
sensing measurement techniques will be employed in the laboratory environment.  Analysis of 
collected process and operational data will allow comparisons between traditional flare material 
balance emissions determinations, process stream measurements, and the emissions rates and 
concentrations measured by the direct and remote sensing technologies. 
 
The TCEQ anticipates that the results of the laboratory tests will be broadly applicable, since 
these measurements will be conducted under controlled conditions.  The TCEQ also anticipates 
that the tests will provide insight to operational conditions that may impact flare VOC DRE and 
flare combustion efficiency, such as assist rates or waste gas volumetric flow rates. 
 
The primary study objectives include: 
 
• assessing the potential impact of waste stream flow rate turndown on flare DRE and 
combustion efficiency; 
• assessing the potential impact of steam/air assist on flare DRE and combustion efficiency 
at various operating conditions, including low flow rate conditions; 
• assessing whether flares operating over the range of requirements stated in 40 Code of 
Federal Regulations § 60.18 achieve the assumed hydrocarbon DRE of 98 percent at 
varying flow-rate turndown and assist ratios as well as variable waste stream heat 
content; and 
• identifying and quantifying the hydrocarbon species in flare plumes currently visualized 
with passive infrared cameras. 
 
Field tests should be conducted during the November 2009 to March 2010 time frame, depending 
on approval of the final test plan and the availability of a test facility.  A final report is expected 
during the summer of 2010. 
 
6.2.2.6  Study of Houston Atmospheric Radical Precursors (SHARP)  
An extensive field study of ozone precursors and formation was conducted in the HGB area in 
April, May, and June 2009 using cutting-edge measurement technology.  Approximately $2 
million of air quality research funds for this project were provided by the state legislature.  The 
goal of the SHARP study is to investigate the: 

 
6-4 
 
• 
contribution of direct emissions of formaldehyde and nitrous acid from flares, stacks, and 
other point and mobile sources; 
• 
importance of secondary formation of formaldehyde from the ozonolysis of olefins; 
• 
identification of formation pathways of nitrous acid; 
• 
ambient levels of nitryl chloride and potential impact as a ozone precursor; and 
• 
spring and early summer ozone formation mechanisms in the HGB area. 
 
The data from this study will be analyzed in 2009 and 2010 and used to better understand HGB 
area emissions and chemistry, enhance model inputs and mechanisms, and aid in the evaluation of 
control strategy development. 
 
6.3  FUTURE INITIATIVES 
6.3.1  Mid-Course Review (MCR) 
The commission is soliciting comments on whether it is appropriate to perform a 1997 eight-hour 
ozone standard MCR analysis for the HGB area, and, if so, what elements should be contained in 
the analysis.  The commission is also seeking input on the appropriate date to submit the MCR. 
 
6.3.2  2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) 
On March 12, 2008, the EPA strengthened its NAAQS for ground-level ozone from 0.08 parts per 
million 
(ppm) 
to 
0.075 
ppm. 
 
Governor 
Rick 
Perry 
submitted the state's 
recommendation regarding boundaries and designations under the federal 2008 eight-hour ozone 
standard to the EPA on March 10, 2009.  The HGB area (Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, 
Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties) was included in the governor’s 
recommended nonattainment areas.  Continued efforts to reduce ozone precursors will be 
necessary to address this new ozone standard.

Executive Summary
Background
In recent years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and some State and local permitting
authorities recognized a change in the manufacturing landscape.  This change arose in today’s increasingly
competitive global markets, requiring companies to respond rapidly to market signals and demand, while
delivering products faster, at lower cost, and of equal or better quality than their competitors.  As their market
response and product development time frames shrank, companies in several industries perceived the potential
administrative “friction” – costs, time, delay, uncertainty, and risk – resulting from operating under
conventional air permitting approaches to increase.  This raised an important question:  how to provide these
U.S. companies with the “flexibility” to compete effectively in global markets without decreasing
environmental protection?  At the same time, the EPA and others sought ways to align the regulatory
framework to encourage emissions reduction and pollution prevention.
To address these challenges, the EPA and several State and local permitting authorities worked with selected
companies over the past few years in the context of individual permit pilots to develop innovative approaches
to air permitting.  The EPA and the States launched these efforts to increase sources’ operational flexibility
while ensuring environmental protection and facilitating pollution prevention.  Permitting authorities involved
in these pilot initiatives designed permits within the existing regulatory framework to address all applicable
air requirements.  As interest in innovative approaches to air permitting increased, the EPA evaluated the
implementation experience with “flexible” permitting techniques developed under pilot permitting efforts, such
as the EPA’s Pollution Prevention in Permitting Program (P4) and various State innovation initiatives.  The
EPA believes that careful evaluation of the implementation experience with such flexible permits can improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of future efforts and help to inform evolving air policymaking activities in
these areas.  The EPA launched the Flexible Permit Implementation Review to meet these objectives.
What Is Flexible Air Permitting?
The term “flexible permit” is used in this report to describe air permits with conditions designed to reduce the
administrative “friction” – costs, time, delay, uncertainty, and risk – experienced by sources and permitting
authorities when implementing a permit or making certain changes under the permit.  This is typically
accomplished by allowing a source to make certain types of changes (e.g., modifications to a source’s method
of operation, equipment, raw materials, emission factors, or monitoring parameters) without requiring
additional case-by-case permitting, provided the source meets certain criteria outlined in its operating or
construction permit.  Such criteria might include the maintenance of plant-wide emissions levels below
enforceable caps.  Over the past decade, the EPA and State and local permitting authorities have also piloted
specific permitting techniques and tools to accomplish advance-approval for certain types of changes that
might take place over the course of a permit term.  While chosen solutions will depend on individual state
permitting rules and requirements, such techniques typically include descriptions of advance-approved
changes or categories of changes in the permit, procedures for testing pollution control device performance
and updating emission factors or parameter values without requiring the permit to be amended or re-opened,
elimination of redundant requirements by applying the most stringent applicable requirement, and provisions
to explicitly encourage pollution prevention.

Flexible Permit Implementation Review Findings
The EPA launched the Flexible Permit Implementation Reviews to examine the implementation experience
with innovative air permitting techniques.  Under this initiative, the EPA assembled a Review Team,
representing multiple EPA offices supplemented by contractor support, to conduct in-depth reviews of six pilot
permits with innovative flexibility provisions and sufficient operating history.  These pilot permits were
developed for the following companies: 3M, DaimlerChrysler, Imation, Intel, Lasco Bathware, and Saturn.
The reviews included detailed analyses of source and permitting authority experiences developing and
implementing flexible air permits, based on review of information in the public record, discussions with source
and permitting authority personnel, site visits to the source and permitting authorities, and verification of
recordkeeping and emissions calculation requirements.
The EPA’s review and analyses support the following findings for the six flexible permits covered in this
review.
Finding 1: The flexible permits contain adequate measures to assure compliance with all applicable
requirements.
Permitting authorities and the EPA found that the flexible permits contained monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting mechanisms sufficient to assure that identified regulatory requirements are met and that appropriate
measures are in place.  The EPA Review Team did find, however, that certain topics related to renewal of
flexible permits warrant further discussion and clarification.  These topics include determining acceptable
approaches for adjusting plant-wide emissions caps at permit renewal, and determining acceptable approaches
to transition back to conventional permitting approaches if flexible permits are allowed to expire.
Finding 2: The flexible permits were considered to be enforceable by permitting authorities and
EPA.
A key objective was to verify that the flexible permit provisions are enforceable by permitting authorities and
the EPA.  The six permitting authorities involved in the pilots all reported the ability to detect non-compliance
with flexible permit conditions and to enforce the permit requirements, and expressed certainty that permit
requirements could be enforced, had the need arisen.  For all permits, the EPA was able to replicate the
emissions calculations for selected time periods to demonstrate compliance.  Permitting authorities reported
that conducting inspections of sources with flexible permits is comparable to conducting inspections of sources
with conventional permits.
Finding 3: The flexible permits facilitated and encouraged emissions reductions and pollution
prevention.
The flexible permits contain mechanisms designed to facilitate and encourage emissions reductions and
pollution prevention (P2).  Five of the sources with flexible permits lowered actual plant-wide emissions during
their permit terms, and the sixth source lowered its emissions per unit of production during the permit term.
For example, using pollution prevention (P2), Intel lowered actual emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) from 190 tons/year to 56 tons/year while increasing production.  After a substantial voluntary
reduction of VOC emissions from 10,000 tons/year, 3M further lowered its actual VOC emissions from 4,300
tons/year to below 1,000 tons/year.  This reduction resulted primarily from increased pollution control device
performance, greater use of voluntary controls, P2, and reduced production.  DaimlerChrysler lowered its

6
actual VOC emissions from 1,400 tons/year to less than 800 tons/year, primarily through P2 associated with
vehicle coatings and plant solvent usage.
The plant-wide emissions caps focused organizational attention on reducing plant-wide emissions.  In many
cases, the advance approved change provisions reduced the administrative “friction” associated with P2
changes, making such changes more attractive for sources to undertake.  The flexible permits increased
internal awareness and focus on pollution prevention at the sources through explicit P2 program, reporting,
and/or performance requirements.
Finding 4: Companies with the flexible permits believe that air permitting is on their critical
response path.
Each of the sources with flexible permits reported that conventional permitting approaches can constrain their
ability to compete effectively.  The combination of increasingly globalized competition and a shift to new
modes of production substantially increased the pressure to operate highly flexible, nimble, and responsive
research, development, and production operations.  For example, competitive pressures and computer design
advances in the automotive sector have compressed the new vehicle development process from five years
to less than 18 months, requiring increasingly flexible production systems and time sensitive equipment
changes.  For products in the semiconductor and specialty tape industries, competitive pressures frequently
cause certain products to become obsolete within six to nine months, as customers’ specifications change and
technology evolves.  Advance production concepts, such as lean manufacturing, designed to help firms
compete effectively, require rapid, and often iterative, operational and equipment changes for continuous
improvement of resource productivity, operational efficiency, and product quality.  For these reasons,
companies report that conventional case-by-case permitting actions can be problematic due to the potential
delay and uncertainty of final permit actions.  Companies with flexible permits identified similar needs at other
facilities and are interested in pursuing flexible permits for those facilities.
Finding 5: Companies with the flexible permits utilized their flexibility provisions.
Flexibility provision utilization during the permit terms exhibited rates and types of changes consistent with the
needs expressed by the companies during permit development.  The actual number of changes made using
advance approval and other flexibility provisions varied by source, with Intel implementing the most changes
(e.g., approximately 150 to 200 equipment and operational changes per year).  Other companies implemented
fewer changes (e.g., more in the range of 20 or fewer changes per year), but emphasized that the relative
value of making certain critical changes can be more important than the number of changes made.  Some
companies did not utilize all of the flexible permit provisions, but generally anticipated using the flexibility
provisions in the future.  The flexible permits accommodated a substantial number of advance approved
changes while providing sufficient clarity in describing the advance approved changes to ensure
enforceability.  Additionally, flexible permits facilitated an increase in the rate and a shift in the type of
changes made, when compared to what might have occurred under a conventional permit.
Finding 6: The flexible permits enhanced information sharing between the companies and
permitting authorities.
The flexible permits enhanced the permitting authorities’ overall understanding of company activities and
emissions as compared to conventional permitting approaches.  The flexible permit development process
provided the permitting authorities with a clearer understanding of the maximum emissions levels anticipated
during the permit terms.  During permit development, companies provided more information regarding the type
of changes anticipated during the permit term.  This provided a more comprehensive, up-front picture of

7
anticipated operational activities and associated environmental performance than a conventional permitting
process.
During permit implementation, information about a company’s specific changes under the advance approval
provisions was generally comparable to information provided under a conventional permitting process.  The
flexible permits also required information about total source emissions and pollution prevention that is not
typically required under conventional permitting.
Finding 7: The flexible permits generally provided to the public equivalent or greater information
than conventional permits.
The flexible permits shifted the timing, type, and format of information made available to the public about
emissions performance, operational and equipment changes, and P2 activities.  The specific format, timing,
and availability of certain types of information required by the flexible permits varied, particularly for advance
approved changes.  In all cases, the flexible permits provided more information up-front about operational
changes (or categories of changes) that the sources anticipated making during the permit terms.  This
provided the public with an opportunity to understand and comment on the companies’ anticipated changes.
During permit implementation, four of the flexible permits provided equivalent or greater information for
specific changes made under the advance approval provisions, although in a different format and timing than
typically available under conventional permitting.  In two cases, the pilot permits resulted in less information
about certain changes implemented under the advance approval provisions.  In the areas of total plant-wide
emissions information and/or P2 information, all of the pilot permits increased the availability of information
to the public for the companies’ emissions and activities.  For all six permits, the permitting authorities
indicated that, on balance, the flexible permits improved the availability of information to the public, ensuring
the flow of significant and meaningful information regarding the current status and future direction of
operations and emissions.
Finding 8: The flexible permits produced or are anticipated to produce net financial benefits to
companies and permitting authorities.
Companies and permitting authorities reported that the flexible permits resulted in net financial benefits or are
anticipated to do so in the future.  Companies and permitting authorities indicated that initial permit
development costs exceeded those required to develop conventional permits because of the innovative nature
of the permits and additional resources associated with developing site-specific flexible permit provisions.
In each case, however, companies and permitting authorities reported that the flexibility provisions decreased,
or are expected to decrease, the administrative costs of operating under the permit to more than offset the
initially higher permit development costs.  Companies reported that the potential opportunity costs of project
delays from air permitting can be high, ranging as high as several million dollars in just a few days.  In so far
as flexible permits can minimize project delays, the economic benefits to companies can be correspondingly
large.  Permitting authorities typically reported that the additional permit development costs for flexible permits
were offset by resource savings within the first three years of permit implementation.
Finding 9:  Permitting authorities are generally supportive of flexible permits as an option.
The six permitting authorities involved in the flexible permits indicated that they are pleased with the
environmental and administrative benefits of the permits.  They believe flexible permitting techniques are
useful tools to address some sources’ operational flexibility needs, to foster environmental improvements
through emissions reductions, and to reduce required permitting resources and backlogs for permitting.  This
increased permit efficiency allows the public agencies to focus resources on higher environmental

8
management priorities.  Permitting authorities expressed interest in renewing the flexible permits and
expanding the use of flexible permits within their jurisdictions and believed that finalization of EPA policy
and/or guidance for flexible permits should increase national interest and efficiency in expanding their use.
Additionally, permitting authorities stated that various forms of EPA outreach, training, and assistance would
be useful to assist permitting authorities to develop effective flexible permits.
Finding 10:  Permitting authorities indicated that flexible permit provisions should be matched with
a company’s need for flexibility and technical capacity to implement effectively its flexible permit
requirements.
Permitting authorities believe that flexible permits meet applicable requirements and are fully enforceable.
However, such permits may not be appropriate for all sources.  Permitting authorities believe that two critical
factors should be considered when determining the appropriateness of flexible permitting for a particular
company.  First, the company should be able to demonstrate that it has a sufficient need for the flexibility to
justify the additional up-front permitting authority time and resources required to develop flexible permit
provisions for the company.  Second, the company should exhibit the technical capacity to operate effectively
under a flexible permit.  Factors such as a source’s compliance history, commitment to pollution prevention,
and ability to track and manage operational changes and emissions should be considered by permitting
authorities when determining the appropriateness of a flexible permit for a company.

1The term “flexible permits” has been primarily used to describe permits with conditions that enable
permitted sources to make certain changes (e.g., modifications to operations, equipment, raw material, emission
factors, monitoring parameters) without requiring further case-by-case review and approval or permit modifications
from the permitting authority.  The term also encompasses those approved permit conditions which are sufficient to
enable a more expedited permit revision process, but not to accomplish a full advance-approval.  This report and its
appendices use the terms “flexible permits,” “flexible permit conditions,” and “flexibility provisions” to denote
permits and permit conditions that include such provisions related to advance approval.  See Section D for a
discussion of flexibility provisions examined by the EPA’s Flexible Permit Implementation Review.

I.  Introduction
A.  Project Scope and Purpose
Over the last several years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and several State and local
permitting authorities worked with several companies to develop innovative approaches to air permitting.  The
EPA and States launched these pilots to increase operational flexibility while ensuring environmental
protection.  Permit developers sought to encourage and facilitate emissions reductions and pollution prevention
with the flexible permits.  The permits were also designed to reduce the administrative “friction” – costs, time,
delay, uncertainty and risk – associated with making certain types of operational and equipment changes.
Additionally, permitting authorities desired to reduce the resources needed for case-by-case applicability
determinations and for the approval process of subject minor and major New Source Review (NSR) permit
applications and other permitting amendments.  Permitting authorities designed these “flexible permits” within
the existing regulatory framework (i.e., approaches were not precluded under any relevant Federal or State
regulation) to address all applicable air requirements.1
As interest in flexible air permitting increased, the EPA saw the need to evaluate the implementation
experience with flexible permits developed under pilot efforts such as EPA’s Pollution Prevention in
Permitting Program (P4) and State innovation activities.  Particular interest has focused on flexible permitting
techniques such as plant-wide emissions limits (e.g., plant-wide applicability limits, or PALs; potential-to-emit
caps).
In response to this need, the EPA launched the Flexible Permit Implementation Review to conduct in-depth
reviews of six flexible permits developed since 1993.  The EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards (OAQPS) initiated this effort, in partnership with EPA’s Office of Policy, Economics, and
Innovation (OPEI).  The EPA Office of Policy Analysis and Review (OPAR), the Office of General Counsel
(OGC), and the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) provided support for this effort.
The purpose of the Flexible Permit Implementation Review is to help the EPA:
•
Determine whether the flexible permits work as envisioned, providing the desired operational
performance improvements and environmental protection.
•
Obtain more detailed and better organized information regarding these efforts.
•
Improve communication of the details and results of these efforts.
•
Understand how such flexible permitting approaches might be improved.
•
Assess the level of environmental benefit achieved under flexible permits.
•
Learn how similar flexible permit development processes can be streamlined in the future.
•
Provide input, as appropriate, into the final development of corresponding EPA policy.

B.  Structure of this Report
This report presents the EPA’s findings from the Flexible Permit Implementation Review.  The Executive
Summary briefly addresses the review’s purpose, scope, approach, and findings.  The Introduction includes
a more detailed account of the project purpose and scope (Section A), the structure of this report (Section
B), and the review approach and process (Section C).  Section D introduces the primary types of flexibility
provisions that are included in the six flexible permits reviewed in this evaluation.  Section E summarizes the
flexibility provisions contained in the six flexible permits, and briefly discusses the sources’ operations,
emissions, emissions sources, and emissions control equipment.  The Findings Section presents the EPA’s ten
major findings from this flexible permit evaluation.  Each finding is explored in detail, drawing on examples
from the six Permit Review Reports.
C.  Review Approach and Process
The EPA’s Flexible Permit Implementation Review involved detailed analysis of company and permitting
authority experiences implementing six flexible air permits.  To structure the six permit reviews, OAQPS
developed a “Flexible Permit Review Framework” that includes specific evaluation questions grouped into
eight areas of inquiry.  The Flexible Permit Review Framework was developed by OAQPS in consultation
with other EPA offices, including OPAR, OECA, OGC, and OPEI.
C.1  Flexible Permit Review Framework
The areas of inquiry in the Flexible Permit Review Framework are listed below.  Each of the six Permit
Review Reports accompanying this report are structured based on this review framework, and they include
the specific questions and areas of inquiry that were addressed by the reviews.
•
Background: This section examines background information on the permitting authority’s structure,
capacities, and processes; the pilot source’s operations and characteristics; and the company’s need
for flexibility.
•
Flexible Permit Design Features: This section examines the specific flexibility provisions
contained in the permit and the terms which assure compliance with them, including monitoring,
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
•
Public Participation and Public Perception: This section assesses the public’s participation in the
development of the flexible permit through examination of the public involvement process and the
record of public comments.  It examines the flows of information during development and
implementation of the pilot permit, and compares these to what might have been experienced under
conventional permitting.
•
Implementation of Flexible Permit Provisions: This section examines when and how flexible
permit provisions were actually utilized by the source during permit implementation.  It explores how
the flexible permit implementation might compare to the experience under a conventional permit.
This section also assesses the quality and quantity of information generated under the flexible permit
and discusses any problems that were encountered.

design features, such as advance-approved change provisions, were adequate to assure compliance
with all applicable requirements.
•
Practical Enforceability of the Flexibility Provisions: This section assesses the ability of the
source and permitting authority to determine compliance with the permit conditions and applicable
requirements.  It also examines the ease of inspection associated with the flexible permit.
•
Permit Costs, Environmental Benefits, and Value Added: This section assesses the relative
costs and benefits of the flexible permit to the source and permitting authority, as compared to a
conventional permit.  In particular, this section examines whether the permit actually provided desired
flexibility to the source as well as equivalent or better environmental protection.
•
Other Issues:  This section addresses ways in which flexible permits can be improved and how the
EPA can support such improvements in the future.
C.2  EPA Review Team
The EPA assembled a core Permit Review Team consisting of representatives from various EPA offices,
including OAQPS, OPEI, and OECA.  Ross & Associates Environmental Consulting, Ltd., under subcontract
to the EPA through Industrial Economics, Inc., provided overall team coordination services and compiled
review results.  In addition, representatives from Midwest Research Institute, under contract to the EPA,
participated in the reviews to support the EPA’s evaluation of the emissions monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting requirements and practices.  At least six representatives from this group participated in each of the
six individual permit reviews and associated site visits.  In some cases, the EPA Review Team was
supplemented by representatives from the EPA Regional Office in which the pilot permit was developed.
C.3  Permit Review Process
The Flexible Permit Review Framework was completed for each of the six flexible permits.  This was
accomplished through extensive off-site research, on-site visits to the source and the permitting authority, and
a review process for finalizing responses to the Flexible Permit Review Framework.  Prior to each site visit,
preliminary responses to many of the review questions were drafted by the EPA and its contractors based
on information collected through pre-site visit conference calls with each company and permitting authority.
Background research also included review of the flexible permits and other publicly available records,
including permit applications, public comments received during permit review or implementation, inspection
reports, monitoring data summaries, compliance certifications, notices, and other records.
The on-site reviews consisted of visits to the source and the permitting authority.  The EPA Review Team’s
one to one-and-a-half day visits were designed to collect and verify evidence and data to complete the
Flexible Permit Implementation Review Reports.  The EPA on-site reviews were not conducted as
compliance audits of the sources.  Rather, they assessed the company and permitting authority’s experience
with developing and implementing the flexible permits, so as to help improve similar permits in the future.  The
site visits included discussions with company and permitting authority personnel and a walk-through of the
plant, as well as a detailed examination of on-site records, including monitoring data.  Representatives from
the permitting authority participated in the source site visits and discussions.  The plant site visits were
typically followed by a half-day visit of the EPA Review Team to the permitting authority offices to discuss
specific aspects of the review framework relevant to the permitting authority.  Company personnel did not
participate in meetings and discussions at the permitting authorities.

12
12
Following each site visit, extensive steps were taken to ensure the accuracy of information catalogued in the
Flexible Permit Review Frameworks.  EPA contractors prepared initial drafts of the Permit Review Reports.
EPA contractors conducted follow-up discussions, as necessary, with the sources and the permitting
authorities to complete these draft Permit Review Reports.  The EPA Review Team provided preliminary
review and comment on the draft Permit Review Reports.  The revised Permit Review Reports were then
forwarded to the relevant company and permitting authority contacts for review and comment.  Companies
and permitting authorities were asked to verify the accuracy and completeness of the responses contained
in the Permit Review Reports.  Based on these comments, the EPA contractors worked with OAQPS and
OPEI staff to finalize the six Permit Review Reports.  This Summary Report was prepared by OAQPS and
OPEI, with support from contractors, and was reviewed and commented on by other members of the EPA
Review Team.
C.4 Flexible Permit Selection
EPA selected six pilot permits for review based on the following criteria.
•
Extent of permit implementation and/or duration since permit issuance.
•
Likelihood of source and permitting authority voluntary participation in the review.
•
Number and type of flexibility provisions in permit.
•
Unique features of flexible permit.
•
Diversity of emissions and applicable requirements.
•
Number of inspections completed.
•
Relevance of permit to inform ongoing EPA efforts to develop policy.
Table 1.1 lists the six flexible permits selected for inclusion in the Flexible Permit Implementation Review (see
end of report).
D.  What Are Flexible Permit Provisions?
The term “flexible permit” is frequently used to describe pilot permits with conditions that reduce the
administrative “friction” – costs, time, delay, uncertainty, and risk – experienced by companies and permitting
authorities when making certain changes under the permit.  Such changes could include modifications to a
source’s method of operation, equipment, raw materials, emission factors, or monitoring parameters.  The six
flexible permits examined in this review contain flexibility provisions which advance approve such changes
or categories of changes.  While flexible permit solutions will depend on individual state permitting rules and
requirements, a variety of flexible permit provisions have been developed by the EPA and State and local
permitting authorities to accomplish advance approval for a category of changes.  Several types of flexible
permit provisions utilized in permits reviewed in this report are summarized below.
D.1  Description of Advance-Approved Changes
The six flexible permits include descriptions that enable the advance-approval of specific changes and/or
categories of changes.  Advance approved change descriptions typically allow companies to make a fairly
broad spectrum of modifications, eliminating the need for additional case-by-case review and approval by the
permitting authority at the time the plant makes the change.  Changes that trigger new applicable requirements
(i.e., requirements unaddressed by the advance approval provisions) or require modifications to monitoring,
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements are not advance approved.  To implement advance approved
changes, sources must maintain plant-wide emissions below applicable limits.  In addition, they typically must
submit notice to the permitting authority and maintain on-site logs providing documentation of the changes

2This assumes the sources is in an attainment area.  SERs also differ depending on the pollutant in
question.
13
13
implemented under the advance approval provisions (e.g., the addition of a new emissions unit).
Some of the flexible permits contain provisions that only partially advance approve particular types of changes,
providing a streamlined review and approval process.  Permitting authorities believe this to be useful as an
interim approach for certain types of changes and review requirements.  For example, a flexible permit might
advance approve a set of changes to which a source must apply best available control technology (BACT).
The permit, however, could preserve the conventional process for public comment on the company’s proposed
BACT approach, as well as the permitting authority’s opportunity to reject or comment on the proposed
BACT approach at the time of the change.
D.2  Plant-wide Emissions Limits
All six flexible permits contain one or more plant-wide caps on emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOC) and/or criteria air pollutants.  These emissions caps typically included annual/12-month rolling limits
(e.g., tons/year) and short-term limits (e.g., pounds/hour) that cover emissions from all emissions sources at
a plant, including any that may be “grandfathered” under the Clean Air Act.
Emissions caps can function in different ways.  First, caps can serve as a basis for ensuring new applicable
requirements are not triggered.  In other words, caps can be set in such a way that (as long as there is no
violation of the limit) new applicable requirements will not be triggered.  Potential-to-emit (PTE) caps typically
establish “synthetic” minor source status for applicability purposes under one or more regulations by setting
a limit on plant-wide emissions below the emissions threshold that would trigger major source status.  In
addition, for major sources, Plant-wide Applicability Limit (PAL) baselines are typically set at an average of
the actual plant emissions for the previous two years (or another more representative period) plus 39
tons/year, an increment just under the Significant Emissions Rate (SER) for VOC emissions of 40 tons/year
that would trigger major New Source Review.2  In another variation, Oregon rules establish an annual and
short-term Plant-Site Emissions Limit (PSEL) for sources in the State, based on each source’s actual
emissions in 1978, that is contained in the State Implementation Plan (SIP).  The PSEL also functions to
define the aggregate emissions level below which major NSR would not apply to changes made at the site.
Short-term emissions caps, where required, also act to assure that the advance approved changes in
combination with existing emissions do not adversely impact the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) (in attainment areas).  Finally, emissions caps serve to bound the magnitude of advance approved
changes so as to define them in a reasonably anticipated alternative operating scenario for title V permitting
purposes.  Often, when more than one cap was involved, these caps can be streamlined into one plant-wide
emissions limit (i.e., combined into the most stringent form) so as to serve multiple functions at the same time.
D.3  Replicable Testing Procedures
Several of the flexible permits contain replicable testing procedures that enable sources to update the
monitored parameter levels of concern (e.g., pollution control device efficiencies, emission factors), based
on approved testing results, without requiring a permit modification.  Permit provisions describe the replicable
procedure to be used when testing and updating parameters, and the actual parameter values are documented
in required correspondence between the permitting authority and company, which are maintained at the
source and in the permitting authority’s files along with the permit.
D.4  Applicable Requirement Streamlining
Pursuant to EPA guidance presented in White Paper Number Two, several of the flexible permits streamlined

14
14
applicable requirements to reduce permit complexity.  In these instances, overlapping and redundant
requirements were subsumed under the most stringent requirement(s).  This technique was particularly
effective when it was used as part of a “clean building” approach.  A “clean building” is a separate structure
or collection point within a plant site containing emissions units that are (or will be in the case of new units)
routed to one or more dedicated, state-of-the-art air pollution control devices.  To advance approve
modifications or new unit additions in a “clean building” with respect to all technology-based requirements,
the control device must assure compliance for all the advance approved changes (as well as for all unchanged
existing operations in the same building) with the most stringent requirement that could apply to any of the
activities being advance approved to occur within the “clean building.”
D.5  Pollution Prevention Provisions
Several of the flexible permits contained explicit pollution prevention (P2) conditions designed to focus greater
plant attention on P2 and to take full advantage of the P2 that often takes place when flexible permit
provisions are established.  These conditions ranged from P2 program development and reporting
requirements to enforceable P2 performance targets.
E.  Pilot Permit and Source Characteristics
While the flexible permits contain provisions to accomplish advance approval that are generally similar, each
permit has a unique combination of conditions that are tailored to the company’s flexibility needs,  operations,
and State-specific requirements.  This section introduces the six flexible permits evaluated by the EPA’s
Flexible Permit Implementation Review.  Table 1.2 highlights the key flexibility provisions in each permit (see
end of report).  The company operations, emissions sources, and emissions control equipment are summarized
below.  Detailed descriptions of source characteristics, flexible permit provisions, monitoring requirements,
and other background information are available in the six Permit Review Reports.
3M Company - St. Paul, Minnesota
3M’s St. Paul tape plant manufactures more than 550 specialty tape products, including automotive and
medical tapes, graphics tape, offset printing tape, and foam and double-sided tapes.  To produce tape
products, adhesives are mixed at the plant and then applied to a tape backing, or “web”, on one of 18 coaters.
The coated web is fed through ovens to volatilize excess solvent from the adhesives, and is then wound into
rolls and cut for packaging and shipment.  VOC emissions result from volatilized solvents coming off the
adhesive mixing areas and evaporation ovens and are controlled through a highly efficient regenerative
thermal oxidizer (RTO).  The flexible permit, issued in 1993, was needed to provide for an extensive program
of renovations to maintain the long-term viability of this plant in 3M’s network of plants.
DaimlerChrysler Corporation - Newark, Delaware
DaimlerChrysler’s Newark Assembly Plant (NAP) began producing the Dodge Durango, a sports utility
vehicle, in 1997.  While vehicle production levels tend to be cyclical due to model changeovers and economic
demand cycles, vehicle production in July 2001 was about 600 vehicles per day (200,000 vehicles/year).  The
NAP’s initial flexible permit, issued in 1995, enabled the source to retool for Durango production and to
construct a new vehicle coatings building adjacent to the assembly buildings.  Most VOC emissions result
from the various steps in the vehicle coating process (e.g., electro-coat dip tanks, paint booths, curing ovens),
and are controlled through pollution prevention (P2) efforts and, to a lesser extent, by a regenerative thermal
oxidizer.  The NAP emits criteria pollutants (PM10, SO2, NOx, and CO) from operation of the thermal

15
15
oxidizer, five boilers, paint curing ovens, and other combustion sources.
Imation Corporation - Weatherford, Oklahoma
Imation’s Weatherford plant consists of two separate buildings.  The North Building houses Printing and
Publishing Division operations and manufactures products for the graphics arts and printing industries.  Digital
and conventional proofing systems are produced by coating thin films with colored, solvent-borne solids.  The
South Building contains Data Storage Division operations and produces data storage products such as
computer diskettes.  VOC emissions result from the solvent-borne coatings as they are mixed, applied to the
film, and heated in curing ovens.  Production areas are maintained with negative pressure and VOC emissions
from the coaters and ovens are routed to voluntarily installed pollution control devices, including a regenerative
thermal oxidizer, a catalytic oxidizer, and a carbon absorber.  The pollution control equipment, two on-site
boilers, and other miscellaneous combustion sources emit criteria pollutants.  The design of the permit was
critically needed for Imation to test new raw materials and processes in a timely manner.
Intel Corporation - Aloha, Oregon
Intel’s Aloha, Oregon semiconductor fabrication plant produces semiconductor chips for use in computers
and other electronic devices.  An iterative sequence of steps, including application of photoresist, UV light
exposure, developing, etching, rinsing with deionized water, doping, and rinsing with acid and solvent is
employed to transform silicon wafers into semiconductors.  Plant air emissions consist of VOCs and organic
and inorganic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from production processes and cleaning activities, as well as
criteria pollutants from on-site boilers.  The flexible permit was designed to rely primarily on a campaign of
P2 to advance approve a myriad of small equipment changes and process modifications.
Lasco Bathware - Yelm, Washington
Lasco’s Yelm source produces fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) bathtubs, shower stalls, and whirlpools.
The source operates a gelcoat line and an acrylic line.  Coats of plastic and fiber-reinforced resins are
sprayed in successive layers into molds (gelcoat line) or on preformed acrylic plastic sheets (acrylic line).
Styrene emissions result from the spray booth operations.  Lasco, through P2, limited its emissions per unit
of production so as to allow greater overall production under its emissions cap.  During the flexible permit
term, Lasco also installed a regenerative thermal oxidizer to control these VOC emissions from various steps
in the gelcoat line.
Saturn Corporation - Spring Hill, Tennessee
Saturn operates an integrated automotive production plant that produces a range of Saturn-brand vehicles.
Production, which peaked in 1996 at 314,035 vehicles, has declined in recent years due to weakness in the
subcompact car market segment.  The flexible PSD permit, issued in June 2000, has enabled Saturn to retool
to produce a new, fuel-efficient sport utility vehicle, the Saturn VUE™.  VOC emissions result from the
vehicle paint lines and the lost-foam aluminum foundry operations.  VOC emissions are controlled by eleven
recuperative thermal oxidizers, two regenerative thermal oxidizers, and a hybrid carbon adsorption/thermal
oxidation system.  Criteria pollutants arise from operation of the pollution control equipment, ovens, boilers,
and other miscellaneous natural gas combustion sources.  The Saturn PAL PSD permit is a hybrid permit
consisting of a PSD permit for a major expansion with permitted emissions based on projected future actual
emissions in combination with a PSD permit for existing emissions units with allowable emissions based on
current actual emissions at the existing emissions units.

II.  Findings
Drawing on information collected through the Flexible Permit Implementation Review, the EPA identified the
following findings.  Where appropriate, specific examples are drawn from the six individual permit
implementation experiences.  Readers should refer to the six Permit Review Reports for the full details of
the individual permit reviews.
Finding 1: The flexible permits contain adequate measures to assure
compliance with all applicable requirements.
Evaluation of the design adequacy of the flexible permits requires consideration of the objectives of the permit
developers.  Permitting authorities generally had two primary objectives in mind.  The first was to ensure that
all applicable air requirements were met.  This design objective meant that the flexible permits were
developed to function within the current regulatory framework without new rulemakings.  The permit design
teams believed that it was imperative to address all substantive requirements (e.g., technology, emissions
performance, or work practice requirements) and procedural requirements (e.g., public notification, review,
and comment processes; and reporting and information availability requirements).  If any applicable
requirement were omitted, this could necessitate obtaining construction approval and/or revising the operating
permit solely to address the missing applicable requirement.  This would erode most, if not all, of the potential
benefits from advance approval of the other applicable requirements.  The design challenge was to do so
through techniques and altered administrative practices that would improve company and permitting authority
operational performance and promote P2.  The second design objective focused on improving the
performance, or outcomes, achieved under the permit when compared with performance that would likely
be experienced under a conventional permit.  Specific aspects of this performance improvement goal are
addressed later in this report.
All of the permitting authorities stated that the flexible permits were fully supported by current Federal and
State rules.  They believed that no rulemaking was required to support any of the flexible permitting efforts.
While many of the flexibility techniques are not explicitly described or addressed in existing rules, the
permitting authorities determined that current rules accommodated the flexible permits, since no existing
regulation expressly precluded them and because the approaches did not bypass established substantive and
procedural regulatory requirements.
In several cases, rule interpretations were important to enable certain flexibility provisions.
•
Oregon DEQ and OAPCA representatives both reported that their ability to interpret “emissions unit”
as an entire production line or building, as opposed to a specific piece of equipment or process step,
was instrumental to enabling the advance approval provisions.
•
DNREC determined that it had the ability to allow advance approvals in a manner consistent with
construction time limit requirements.
The EPA found no evidence indicating that any air-related requirements applicable to the sources and their
advance approved changes were missed during permit development.  The EPA also found that the flexible
permits adequately identified all requirements applicable to the advance approved changes.

The flexible permits contained adequate monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting mechanisms to
ensure that regulatory requirements are met and that appropriate measures are in place.
Permitting authorities and the EPA found that the flexible permits included monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting (MRR) approaches that are appropriate given source operations.  They also found that MRR
approaches used in the flexible permits are sufficient to determine ongoing compliance with the permit
conditions and applicable requirements.  Table 2.1 summarizes the MRR requirements contained in the
flexible permits (see end of report).  Please refer to the Permit Review Reports for a more detailed discussion
on the design adequacy of MRR approaches used in the six flexible permits.  In several cases, the permitting
authorities required enhanced MRR requirements to ensure that plant demonstration of compliance with
established emissions caps was performed on a more frequent basis.  These measures were partly designed
to enable sources and permitting authorities to quickly identify problems or trends that could result in potential
emissions cap exceedances, reducing the risk and potential severity of permit violations.
•
3M’s St. Paul tape plant was required to calculate daily and rolling annual emissions totals within 41
hours of the end of each day, comparing these totals with the established VOC emissions caps.
•
DaimlerChrysler was required to submit monthly reports to DNREC documenting plant-wide VOC
and NOx emissions in tons per year for the previous 12 months, as well as plant-wide daily emissions
totals for the month.
In all cases, plant-wide emissions totals and calculations that demonstrated the companies’ compliance with
applicable emissions caps were required to be maintained on-site and were available to agency inspectors
upon request.  The EPA did, however, identify areas in which several of the flexible permits could be
improved to ensure that specific monitoring techniques are consistent with current EPA guidance.  The EPA
did not find that any of these areas for improvement affected the companies’ abilities to monitor actual
emissions, or to ensure compliance with the emissions caps or advance approved change provisions.
However, the EPA Review Team recommends that these improvements be considered in subsequent
versions of the permits.  Several of these recommendations are summarized below.
•
Although the monitoring requirements for the VOC scrubber for Intel’s Fab 4 at the Aloha plant used
an appropriate methodology (i.e., operating parameter monitoring), the elements of the monitoring
approach, were they relevant to the companies’ ability to assure compliance, could be improved by
including an operation and maintenance requirement that relates water flow rate with the flow
corresponding to the optimum VOC removal efficiency, as verified through source testing.
•
The EPA found that Saturn is conducting appropriate monitoring for the emissions caps, and has
submitted a complete monitoring protocol to TDEC, in accordance with permit condition C.2.  The
EPA recommends the addition of several specific monitoring procedures and performance indicator
ranges in the final Title V permit.  These recommended measures are associated with monitoring of
the carbon bed adsorber control equipment.
•
For the Imation permit, the EPA found that continuous measurement of the air flow rate from coaters
12W and 15W and going to the catalytic oxidizer is appropriate parametric monitoring for monitoring
capture efficiency.  However, the permit did not identify any indicator range for this parameter (i.e.,
an operating range outside of which a deviation would require corrective action and reporting was
not identified).  Current monitoring guidance would recommend establishing such an indicator range.
The periodic monitoring of capture efficiency and control device performance using inlet and outlet
THC measurements was identified as an appropriate technique.

3At the time of the EPA site visit in June 2001, the 3M St. Paul Tape Plant was operating under its State air
operating permit, although the advance-approval conditions in the permit expired in March 1998.  The plant has
submitted its Title V permit application and is awaiting its draft Title V permit.
19
19
Implementation of flexible permit monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting provisions was consistent
with that envisioned and intended during permit design.
Permitting authorities reported that the sources’ implementation of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting
(MRR) requirements was consistent with that intended during permit development.  They also found that the
scope, timing, and availability of MRR information was sufficient for the permitting authorities to monitor
companies’ compliance with permit conditions and applicable requirements.  In two cases, adjustments were
made to clarify or alter MRR requirements during permit implementation.
•
During a 1995 inspection, MPCA identified potential deficiencies in the recordkeeping approach for
temperature monitoring of the thermal oxidizer emissions control device at 3M’s St. Paul Tape Plant.
3M was able to demonstrate that no violations of the control device temperature level or the VOC
emissions cap had occurred.  3M and MPCA clarified and agreed on an acceptable approach for
recording future control device temperature readings.
•
In 1996, MPCA eliminated the requirement for a ten-day advance written notice from 3M of changes
implemented under permit condition 2.3.4.  MPCA reported that the agency believed that the post-
commencement notice for changes (submitted within two weeks of an actual change) was sufficient
to provide the agency and the public with a documented record of advance approved changes
actually made at the source.
Certain topics related to the renewal of flexible permits warrant further thinking to clarify acceptable
approaches.
While the flexible permits operated well during the initial permit terms, companies and permitting authorities
identified two areas that could benefit from further thinking and clarification.  The first involves clarifying
acceptable approaches for updating PALs at permit renewal.  Companies and permitting authorities indicated
that revising PAL levels based on the average of actual emissions for the prior two years (or some similar
approach) can create disincentives for emissions reductions and P2 if the correction is too extreme.  At the
same time, permitting authorities and companies acknowledged that some approach for revising PAL levels
at permit renewal is important to address new considerations that may have arisen, such as new applicable
requirements or changes in local air quality or attainment status.
The second area involves the clarification of acceptable approaches to transition back to conventional
permitting approaches if flexible permits are allowed to expire and the company or permitting authority does
not wish to renew the flexibility provisions.  For example, in the case of the 3M St. Paul Tape Plant flexible
permit, the advance approved change provisions expired at the end of the permit term, while the plant-wide
VOC emissions cap has remained in place.3  This has raised questions regarding what level of changes (if
any) would be allowed before New Source Review (NSR) would be triggered.

4The number of inspections conducted of sources with flexible permits by the time of the EPA’s review
varied primarily based on the length of time the source had been operating under the flexible permit.  Permitting
authorities typically reported that they conduct annual inspections of the sources, although in some cases (e.g.,
MPCA’s inspection of 3M’s St. Paul Tape Plant) the frequency of inspections was reduced as permitting authorities
focused on higher priority activities (e.g., issuance of Title V permits).
20

Finding 2: The flexible permits were considered to be enforceable by permitting
authorities and EPA.
A key objective of the EPA’s Flexible Permit Implementation Review was to verify that company compliance
with the flexible permits is enforceable in a practical manner by permitting authorities and the EPA.
Permitting authorities expressed their belief that the flexible permit provisions are practicably enforceable,
and the EPA agrees with these permitting authority assertions based on the findings from the reviews of the
six flexible permits.
The flexible permits contain sufficient monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements to
enable permitting authorities and the EPA to assure compliance.
Permitting authorities believe that the flexible permits are enforceable in a practical manner.  They believe
that they have the ability to detect source compliance with the flexibility provisions, as well as all applicable
requirements, based on the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements established in the permits.
Permitting authorities further reported that their experiences during implementation of the permits confirmed
that the flexible permits are enforceable in practice.  See Finding 1 above for additional discussion of the
adequacy of permit design related to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
The EPA agrees with the permitting authorities’ statements regarding the ability to determine company
compliance with permit conditions and applicable requirements based on the findings from this review.  The
EPA found the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting information implemented by the companies for
calculating emissions and determining control equipment parameter values to be sufficient to determine
compliance.  The EPA Review Team was able to reproduce the exact compliance values for each flexible
permit using actual emissions and monitoring data (e.g., material usage data, VOC content data, control device
parameter data) and established emissions calculations procedures.  The EPA found that all data necessary
to perform compliance verification calculations was available and well-organized at the sources.
Permitting authorities reported that conducting inspections of sources with flexible permits is
comparable to conducting inspections of sources with conventional permits.
While the number of inspections conducted by permitting authorities varied, permitting authorities generally
indicated that inspecting sources with flexible permits was straightforward and comparable to conducting
inspections for sources with conventional permits.4  A few permitting authorities stated that some up-front
education was required of permitting authority inspectors to ensure their familiarity with the flexibility
provisions in the permits.  They indicated such orientation was necessary since the flexible permits contained
some requirements not typically required in conventional permits, such as on-site logs of alternate operating
scenarios and changes implemented under the advance approval provisions, as well as plant-wide emissions
calculations.

21
21
In some cases, permitting authorities indicated that the flexible permits resulted in less difficult or time-
consuming inspections.  This was primarily attributed to the reduced need to verify compliance with numerous
requirements for specific equipment or activities that are commonly included in conventional permits (e.g.,
limitations on production rates for process lines, equipment, or process level emissions).  Instead, inspectors
were able to direct attention to ensuring compliance with the plant-wide emissions limits.
Finding 3: The flexible permits facilitated and encouraged emissions reductions
and pollution prevention.
The flexible permits were designed to bring sharper attention to the current level of actual plant-wide
emissions and emissions per unit of production.  While the permits generally did not require actual emissions
reductions during the permit term, they contained provisions to facilitate and encourage emissions reductions
and P2.  The permit implementation experience, supported by statements from the sources and permitting
authorities, indicates that the permits were effective in facilitating emissions reductions and P2.  Of the five
sources which had been operating under their flexible permits for three or more years, all five accomplished
a significant lowering of actual plant-wide emissions and/or emissions per unit of production.  Achieving such
environmental benefits was attributed by the companies to several factors, as discussed below.
Companies accomplished a significant lowering of actual plant-wide emissions and/or emissions per
unit of production during their flexible permit terms.
•
3M lowered its actual VOC emissions from 4,300 tons/year to 700 tons/year due to increased
pollution control device capture of VOCs, greater use of voluntary controls, P2, and reduced
production.
•
DaimlerChrysler lowered its actual VOC emissions from 1,165 tons/year to 776 tons/year, primarily
through P2 associated with vehicle coatings and plant solvent usage.
•
Lasco tested its emission factor as part of developing its flexible permit, leading to a voluntary
reduction in emissions of approximately 100 tons/year prior to obtaining the flexible permit.  During
the permit term, Lasco implemented P2 measures and installed a thermal oxidizer to increase
production while remaining under the emissions cap.  These efforts resulted in per unit emissions
reductions of approximately 32 percent.
•
Using P2 projects, Intel lowered its actual VOC emissions over three-fold, from 190 tons/year to 56
tons/year, to become a synthetic minor source while simultaneously increasing production.
•
As Saturn had only operated under the flexible permit for 13 months (at the time EPA’s review was
conducted), it is difficult to determine trends in VOC emissions per unit of production.  VOC
emissions for the first year of the flexible permit implementation were about 580 tons/year, compared
with 798 tons/year in the year prior to the issuance of the flexible permit (1999).
•
Imation reported that it has achieved about an 11 percent reduction in the pounds of VOC emissions
generated per unit of production in 2000 when compared with 1997 baseline levels.
Companies reported that the plant-wide emissions caps focused organizational attention on reducing
plant-wide emissions.
Several of the flexible permits shifted the allowable level of plant-wide emissions downward.

22
22
•
The flexible permit for 3M’s St. Paul Tape Plant enforceably limited VOC emissions to less than half
those previously emitted by this source.  With respect to actual emissions, MPCA indicated that the
State of Minnesota does not have a technology requirement (such as one for best available state-of-
the-art technology) as part of their State minor New Source Review program.  As a result, air
pollution sources are in a position to maintain their historical emissions and to increase their emissions
in 39-ton increments through minor changes on an ongoing basis.  Under the flexible permit in 1993,
3M became subject to an annual VOC emissions cap of 4,283 tons.  Prior to the flexible permit, 3M
was “grandfathered” to emit up to 65,000 tons annually.  In 1988, 3M had 10,600 tons of actual VOC
emissions and then voluntarily installed controls, bringing emissions down to 4,300 tons/year in 1991.
•
The establishment of VOC PALs for the Saturn plant was part of a PSD permit revision process to
allow approximately a doubling of production capacity.  Even with a substantial increase in production
capacity, the new PSD permit (including incorporation of VOC PALs) sets maximum VOC
emissions at a level of about 50 percent of the allowable VOC emissions under the original,
superceded PSD permit for the plant.
•
Imation’s flexible Title V permit extended emissions limits to the 12W coating line that was previously
“grandfathered” under the Clean Air Act.  Without the voluntary emissions controls that Imation
installed (prior to the flexible permit), the coating line had a potential to emit (PTE) of approximately
4,000 tons/year of VOC.  The permit enforceably limited VOC emissions to one site-wide cap of 249
tons/year, creating “synthetic minor” status for purposes of PSD applicability.  Imation could have
requested two such caps since its operations at Weatherford involved two separate sources [i.e,
different operations with different Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes].
While limits on allowable emissions do not necessarily affect actual emissions, several of the companies
reported that the emissions caps had a “focusing effect,” drawing company personnel’s attention to managing
activities so as to minimize plant-wide emissions.  They added that conventional air permits typically contain
a more diffuse set of emissions limitations on specific equipment or production lines that lack this focusing
effect.  With company attention focused on managing plant-wide emissions levels in relation to an emissions
cap, several companies reported that this created structural incentives for the companies to pursue emissions
reduction opportunities that increase the margin of compliance - the difference between the emissions cap
and actual emissions.  First, companies indicated that emissions reductions result in larger compliance margins
that typically reduce the risk of non-compliance associated with emissions cap exceedances.  Second, per unit
emissions reductions can create room under the cap to accommodate future production increases.
•
Lasco representatives indicated that the 249 tons/year PTE cap on VOC emissions created a strong
P2 and emissions reduction incentive, particularly since the source’s margin of compliance was not
large (e.g., actual emissions were 244.5 in 1998) and since the cap created a real production
constraint.
•
DaimlerChrysler representatives reported that the flexible permit conditions are easier to
communicate to operations personnel since the focus on a plant-wide emissions cap and P2 is more
intuitive and provides more “clarity of focus” than specific equipment or production line requirements.
As a result, it has been easier to engage operations personnel in exploring and implementing P2
projects under the flexible permit.  By eliminating numerous requirements on individual emissions
sources at the plant, the flexible permit has also complemented DaimlerChrysler’s lean manufacturing
initiatives designed to reduce complexity throughout the plant.
While emissions caps, in general, can encourage emissions reductions, certain permit designs can also create
disincentives for reducing emissions.  As mentioned above, several companies voiced a major concern that

23
23
their over-control and/or use of P2 to create emissions “head room” under an emissions cap could be lost due
to five year contemporaneous “ratcheting.”  A significant compliance margin between actual emissions and
applicable emissions caps is desired by sources to buffer against risk of emissions cap exceedances and to
accommodate production fluctuations linked to changing market demand for plant products.  Companies
indicated that a counter-productive “ratcheting” situation can arise if a PAL is totally adjusted downward at
permit renewal to reflect recent actual emissions levels (e.g., average of prior two years actual annual
emissions).
Advance approved change provisions reduced the administrative “friction” associated with P2
changes, making such changes more attractive for companies to undertake.
Advance approval provisions for selected operational, equipment, and raw material changes can significantly
reduce the administrative “friction” of making changes, including delay and costs for undertaking
modifications that have P2 benefits.  Companies indicated that under conventional permits, administrative
friction often arises from two activities.  First, desired changes are typically evaluated by company
environmental personnel to determine whether any regulatory requirements apply to or are triggered by the
desired modification.  Several companies reported that such applicability determinations are often not
straightforward, and that they frequently require careful interpretation and necessitate seeking guidance or
clarifications from the permitting authority.  Second, changes triggering minor NSR are typically subjected
to a notice of construction permitting process to seek approval from the permitting authority in advance of
initiating the modification.  Staff time needed to conduct applicability determinations and individual permit
applications increases transaction costs for each modification.  Additionally, the time frame between when
the desired change is first identified and when it is reviewed and permitted can extend beyond the company’s
desired implementation time frame, resulting in a disincentive to change.
Companies reported that modifications designed to improve resource productivity, process efficiency, or
reduce pollution are often implemented in an iterative manner, as source personnel initiate a modification,
observe and measure results, and then make further refinements to optimize system performance.  This could
involve trying multiple raw materials to find one with optimal product quality and emissions performance
characteristics.  Several companies indicated that under such iterative change processes, increased
transaction costs and time delays - or even perceived uncertainty about such costs and delays - can produce
significant “barriers to entry,” causing the plant to forego modifications with positive environmental outcomes
that lack significant strategic, operational, or competitiveness advantages.  
•
For example, Intel representatives indicated that operations personnel are less willing to engage with
environmental staff in exploring potential P2 opportunities if they perceive that there is a significant
potential for delay or time intensive regulatory evaluations and communications.  Due to the iterative
nature of many P2 projects, operations personnel typically need to conduct a series of experiments
on a manufacturing process to see if the changes produce the desired results.  Intel indicated that
many of these individual changes could be subject to individual construction permitting actions thus
imposing a very jagged, stop-and-go aspect to the experimentation process.  Intel indicated that, under
such conditions, operations personnel might well view experimentation for purposes of pollution
prevention as being too disruptive of the manufacturing process to proceed.
Even when emissions-reducing projects “pay” (e.g., exhibit a positive return on investment), increased
transaction costs, time delays, and uncertainty can reduce the projects’ ability to compete effectively for
internal resources and organizational attention.  The net result can be environmental benefits left on the table.

24
24
Companies reported that advance approval provisions can significantly improve the attractiveness of making
modifications that result in reduced emissions by reducing their transaction costs and the potential for time
delays.  The examples below illustrate ways in which utilization of advance approved change provisions
facilitated P2 activities at several of the sources with flexible permits.
•
Between 1994 and 1998, Intel’s Aloha plant made at least 18 P2-related equipment and material
changes, utilizing the permit’s advance approval provisions, that resulted in VOC emissions reductions
of over 100 tons/year.
•
DaimlerChrysler’s NAP has undertaken numerous P2 activities utilizing the advance-approved
change provisions in their flexible permit, including steps to reduce VOC and HAP emissions from
vehicle coating processes.  DaimlerChrysler representatives reported that, in the absence of a flexible
permit, the source might have still pursued some of these P2 initiatives, but that they may well  have
been delayed to coincide with permit renewal time frames due to the cost and staff resources
required to secure case-by-case permit approvals.  They emphasized that the flexible permits
significantly reduce the regulatory friction associated with making P2 changes, increasing incentives
for P2.
•
Lasco representatives stated that the flexibility provisions allowed the Yelm plant to test and
undertake changes that reduced styrene emissions without having to wait for conventional case-by-
case permit approval.  The advance approved change provisions substantially increased the likelihood
that Lasco would actually research and implement such changes, due to Lasco’s corporate
reluctance to undertake changes that would trigger NSR permitting actions.  Lasco has implemented
several changes utilizing the advance approval provisions that have reduced emissions, including
installation of a new putty station and expansion of emissions control capacity.
Several flexible permits increased company awareness and focus on pollution prevention through
explicit P2 program, reporting, and performance requirements.
Four of the flexible permits contained explicit conditions requiring the companies to implement formal P2
programs, report on P2 performance, and/or meet certain P2 performance targets.  While these companies
had histories of P2 accomplishment prior to issuance of the flexible permits, the companies generally reported
that the explicit P2 permit conditions served to increase the visibility of P2 among plant personnel.  When
combined with the new focus on managing plant-wide emissions against a cap and the relative administrative
ease for accomplishing such changes under the advance approval provisions, the P2 commitments and
programs have empowered some company environmental personnel to expand P2 activities.
•
Intel found that the flexible permit provided clear incentives to favor P2 over new emissions control
technology for meeting the required source-specific, performance-based VOC Reasonably Available
Control Technology (RACT) determination (permit condition 14).  The explicit focus on P2 in the
permit increased environmental personnel’s leverage in their efforts to engage operations personnel
in exploring and implementing P2 efforts.
•
The P2 performance requirement included in the DaimlerChrysler NAP’s flexible permit has
prompted a clear organizational focus on reducing VOC emissions associated with vehicle coating
operations.  DaimlerChrysler is to begin utilizing a powder clearcoat by September 2003 if it is
commercially available; if not, the company is to employ P2 measures that will reduce topcoat VOC
emissions to below seven pounds of VOCs per gallon of applied coating solids on a daily weighted
basis until a powder clearcoat option is commercially available.
•
Even though a Washington State P2 expert familiar with the RFP industry identified Lasco as a “first

25
25
in class” pollution preventer, Lasco found that the flexible permit encouraged and facilitated company
efforts to pursue additional P2 opportunities.  To fulfill the flexible permit’s P2 program requirement
(which is linked to Lasco’s BACT determination for advance approved changes), Lasco instituted
a “P2 Task Force” at the Yelm plant.  The task force is charged with identifying P2 opportunities and
coordinating P2 activities throughout the plant.  Lasco representatives stated that its employees are
now more cognizant of how source emissions affect the community and of the importance of P2 as
a result of the flexible permit development process and the increased organizational focus on P2.
•
As part of its required P2 program, Imation conducted routine P2 meetings with a cross-functional
team of plant managers and personnel at the Weatherford plant.  P2 training for plant employees and
research and development staff further heightened organizational focus on identifying P2
opportunities.  Imation representatives also reported that the formal tracking of progress towards the
plant’s ten percent emissions reduction goal (i.e., based on emissions per unit of production) has
increased plant personnel’s awareness of and attentiveness to P2.
Finding 4:  Companies with the flexible permits believe that air permitting is on
their critical response path.
Companies participating in the review reported that conventional permits can constrain their ability to compete
effectively.  Though the factors differ somewhat for each source, the companies indicated that the
combination of increasingly globalized competition and a shift to new modes of production substantially
increased the pressure to operate highly flexible, nimble, and responsive research, development, and
production operations.  In this context, conventional, case-by-case air permitting, which the companies state
can cause delay and uncertainty, can act as a mission-critical bottleneck to their operations.
Global competition across multiple industry sectors has shortened product life-cycles and increased
the importance of moving new products quickly from development to market.
Companies report that global competition, which intensified during the 1990s through the integration of
financial markets, reductions in trade barriers (e.g., NAFTA), increased industrial development in Asia and
other regions, and substantially shortened product development time frames, has exposed U.S.-based
operations to more and often lower cost producers.  Examples of specific company competitiveness needs
include the following.
•
Intel reported that it operates in a highly competitive market and needs to meet aggressive product
development schedules.  Intel currently introduces a new generation of semiconductor chips every
12 to 24 months, with each new product cycle supported by a major “fab revamp.”  These
operational changes are very time sensitive, to meet product release schedules from computer and
electronics manufacturers, and involve highly interdependent and sequenced steps.
•
3M management indicated that the reduction in trade barriers associated with NAFTA and other
international trade agreements, combined with the overall globalization of competition and the ability
of potential competitors to purchase and install rapidly ""off-the-shelf"" production equipment, enables
other companies to reach rapidly into 3M's market share with low cost product.  In this context, 3M
reports that ""first to market"" (where a week delay can be very significant) has become a critical
business success factor, particularly in specialty product markets, such as the automotive and medical
sectors.  3M reported that many specialty tape products become obsolete, and are replaced by newer

26
26
products, within six to nine months of initial production.
•
DaimlerChrysler indicated that its vehicle development process, in part due to advances in
computer-assisted design, has decreased from five years to about 18 months, substantially reducing
its ability to accommodate conventional permitting time frames while meeting product development
schedules.
•
Saturn indicated that the automotive market has shifted significantly in recent years, necessitating
more rapid responsiveness to market demands.  In this context, Saturn has recently expanded its
available product line and expects further changes in the near future, each of which requires
significant production line retooling and process adjustments.  Saturn also indicated that the vehicle
development process has significantly shortened from five years to about 18 months.  Previous lead
times allowed ample time, in most cases, to secure needed permits while remaining on product
development and release schedules.  Under the new time frames, air permitting is now on its critical
path.
Advance production concepts, designed to help firms compete effectively, encourage rapid, and
sometimes iterative operational and equipment changes to continuously improve resource productivity,
operational efficiency, and product quality.
Production theory and techniques have undergone substantial revision with emphasis placed on continuous
resource productivity improvements.  This emphasis - as reflected in such advanced production concepts as
Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma - substantially influences the day-to-day operating environments at many
companies.  These systems are characterized by a major drive to increase the velocity of production
processes (reduce the time required to transform raw materials into product), increase asset utilization and
cash flow, substantially shorten research and development time frames, continually improve process yields,
and respond to heightened customer expectations for quality, product features, and delivery responsiveness.
Specific examples from the permit reviews include the following.
•
Intel reported a need to make rapid (and sometimes iterative) process and equipment adjustments in
production processes to improve yield, lower costs, reduce chemical usage, and otherwise improve
operations.  Many of these changes involve switching chemicals used in tools and process chemical
formulations, adjusting gas flow rates, and moving or adding tools (e.g., photo lithography equipment,
plasma etchers, liquid acid baths).
•
3M indicated that, in response to competitive pressures, it is involved in a major corporate-wide drive
to reduce cycle times and improve asset utilization and cash flow.  These initiatives require for their
success an in-plant culture of continual improvement and substantial flexibility for production
operations.
•
Lasco indicated that the key focus in the bathtub industry is making minor product modifications on
an ongoing basis (rather than launching major new products like in the semiconductor industry).  In
this context, Lasco's competitive strategy focuses on continually increasing material yields, which
requires seeking ways to utilize less and/or increase the capture of its input materials on a per unit
basis.  Lasco also needed flexibility to change production lines rapidly to accommodate different
product types as short-term demand fluctuated among them.
•
Saturn identified factory “agility” as a key to its ability to compete within the General Motors network
of plants for new product lines, citing its flexible permit (and the factory responsiveness it provided)
as a critical factor in its selection to produce the L850 “world engine.”
•
Imation representatives indicated that the company desired to use the Weatherford plant to
experiment with and pilot new coating technologies and product recipes to respond quickly to changes

27
27
in customer demand, as well as new production innovation opportunities.  These changes involve
short-term experimental use of manufacturing equipment, at times requiring changes to equipment
configurations and the emissions profiles of the equipment.  Imation further indicated that  market
demands frequently require rapid process changes, including substituting or introducing new raw
material, relocating, modifying or adding new equipment, and/or interchanging pollution control
devices.
Companies indicated that responding effectively to increasingly industry competitiveness requires operating
environments capable of responding rapidly to changing market circumstances (e.g., develop and introduce
new products rapidly and adjust production to address customer requests), moving production rapidly among
facilities to achieve optimal asset utilization, and generally engendering a culture of continual operational
improvement.  The companies indicated that this results in an operating environment where changes to
equipment, operating parameters, equipment configurations, and locations are more common and are often
subject to tight deadlines.
Companies report that conventional permitting can be problematic due to the potential delay and
uncertainty associated with such actions.
Although some variability exists, Federal and State and local air permitting rules generally prohibit an air
pollution source from constructing, modifying, reconstructing, or operating an emissions unit, stationary source,
or control device without explicit approval (typically in the form of an air permit or permit modification
undertaken on a case-by-case basis at the time a source desires a change).  The typical process for obtaining
any needed New Source Review (NSR) approval involves the following:
•
Communicating the nature of prospective changes to the permitting authority and discussions to
determine if NSR would apply.
•
Determining all the applicable regulatory requirements that the desired change would “trigger.”
•
Preparing and submitting any necessary permit application providing the details of the desired change.
In many cases, permitting authorities may request additional information before a source’s permit
application is considered to be complete.
•
Reviewing the application at the permitting authority and framing a draft permit (to ensure all
applicable requirements are met, air quality protection is maintained, and needed technology
requirements are imposed).
•
Seeking and addressing public comments on the draft permit or permit modification, if required by
Federal, State, or local rules governing the applicable requirements.  In some cases, this step may
involve public hearings.
•
Issuance of the permit or revision required to undertake the change.
Permitting authorities reported that this process can take as little as 30 days (for a minor change that does
not require public comment), but can extend to six or more months depending on the type of change,
environmental impacts, applicable requirements, and public concerns.  A typical time frame (required or
strongly suggested by agency rules) for most minor source construction permit actions is 90 to 180 days,
although certain permitting authorities indicated that past or current permit back logs inhibit their ability to
respond within these time frames.  Some states such as Oregon have provisions that allow ""minor"" operational
changes (as defined by their specific rules) to proceed in parallel with the permitting process.  Companies
indicated that they utilize this option with some hesitancy since the outcome of the review is uncertain and
the consequences of failing to obtain the permit (or be subject to an unexpected requirement) can be

28
28
substantial.
Companies indicated that this case-by-case permit process can introduce significant delay and uncertainty
into their operational decision-making and research, development, and production activities.  Although
case-by-case permitting actions can impose administrative costs from applicability determinations and permit
application development, companies’ concerns focused on the potential opportunity costs and competitiveness
costs associated with delay and uncertainty in the permit process.
Companies reported that operational change delay results from the need to obtain a permit prior to
“constructing” each planned operational change (or aggregated group of changes).  In the new competitive
environment described by the companies, they often do not have substantial advance notice of the specific
operational changes needed to address customer demands or market opportunities.  As a result, the need to
delay implementation of the change to meet conventional permitting requirements can lead to lost market
opportunity.  Companies further indicated that many of the continual resource productivity improvements they
desire to undertake require experimentation and highly iterative process changes.  In this context, the need
to obtain a permit before each iterative step turns continual improvement into an uncertain process that
operations managers are disinclined to undertake.
•
Intel identified 150 to 200 changes per year that they believe would have triggered minor NSR
permitting.  This number of changes, combined with the Oregon DEQ approval time frame of up to
60 days per change, suggest that there would likely have been significant delay under a conventional
permit.  Even if few delays would have resulted in production downtime or missed market
opportunities, the costs would likely have been significant under a conventional permitting scenario,
as many of the changes improved the cost-competitiveness of Intel’s products through resource
productivity improvements.  Industry estimates of the opportunity costs of production downtime and
time delays run as high as several million dollars in just a few days, due to lost sales to computer
makers and other factors.  Intel representatives indicated that the impact of continued time delays
would likely be to redirect Intel’s production investment and operating facilities to locations where
changes could be accommodated within existing environmental regulations (e.g., other U.S. States
or to other countries where Intel operates, such as Ireland or Israel) as they had done prior to
receiving their flexible permit.
•
DaimlerChrysler and General Motors (Saturn’s parent company) reported that they have experienced
PSD review processes lasting more than 2 years.
Several of the companies indicated that uncertainty in the permitting process creates ""friction"" for the
operational change process because it increases risk.  Companies indicated that uncertainty emerges from
a number of aspects of the permitting process.  First, companies reported that they are at times unsure about
the applicability of permitting requirements to maintenance, repair, and replacement activities.  Second, future
permit requirements can be unpredictable due to the discretion inherent in setting emissions limits, making
technology determinations, and establishing monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.  Third, the
length of the permit review and approval process can be unpredictable, due to such factors as permitting
authority backlogs and the degree of public interest.  According to the companies, these factors combine to
make it difficult for a company to accurately estimate the time frame and cost of a permitting action and,
therefore, how the need to permit will affect the financial attractiveness and overall viability of an operational
change.
Companies with flexible permits stated that they have similar needs at other facilities and are

29
29
interested in pursuing flexible permits for those facilities.
The six companies reported that they have identified similar flexibility needs at other facilities, and they
expressed interest in pursuing flexible permits for those facilities.  For example:
•
Imation’s Camarillo, California source has been issued a flexible permit through the EPA’s Project
XL initiative, modeled in several respects on the Weatherford permit.  Imation representatives stated
that they believe the flexibility techniques used in the Weatherford permit would be beneficial to other
Imation facilities as well.
•
DaimlerChrysler pointed to a plant in the Midwest as a primary example of the company’s need to
expand the use of flexible permitting approaches to other facilities.  The plant’s eight existing permits
have multiple, unit-specific technology limits, emissions limits for different time periods, and a variety
of operating conditions specific to each emissions unit, for a total of 128 specific permit conditions
(as compared to only 16 for the Newark Assembly Plant’s permit).  Since the late 1980s, the source
has been addressing permit modifications and other concerns on a continuous basis.  More
specifically, since 1992 the plant obtained 12 permits or permit revisions, with two involving Federal
NSR.  Three recent amendments took, on average, over a year to complete.  DaimlerChrysler
believes that had the plant been operating under a flexible permit, this number of permit transactions
could have been reduced to only two, saving time and money as well as facilitating timely completion
of P2 activities.  DaimlerChrysler representatives indicated that the company has set a goal of having
flexible permits for all DaimlerChrysler facilities in the U.S. within two years.  However,
DaimlerChrysler reported that permitting authorities in several other States are opting to hold off on
negotiating such permits until EPA guidance and/or rulemaking are complete.
Finding 5: Companies with the flexible permits utilized their flexibility
provisions.
Flexibility provision utilization during the permit terms exhibited rates and types of changes consistent
with the needs expressed by the companies during permit development.
All of the companies have utilized advance approval provisions contained in their flexible permits.
•
As mentioned, Intel reported that the Aloha plant made an average of approximately 150 to 200
operational and equipment modifications per year during the Title V permit term that would likely
have been subject to Oregon’s case-by-case Notice of Construction approval process under a
conventional permit.  These changes, primarily associated with “fab revamps” to scale-up production
of new semiconductors and iterative changes to optimize existing production processes (including P2-
driven changes), were implemented using the advance approval provisions in the Title V permit.
•
3M made 34 equipment and operational changes that utilized the advance approval conditions.  3M
estimated that 15 to 20 of the changes would likely have required some form of permitting action
under Minnesota’s conventional permitting process, with two of these changes likely having triggered
at least case-by-case PSD permitting analyses.  3M indicated that the advance approval provisions
accommodated all of the source’s change needs (i.e., no additional construction permitting actions
were necessary), enabling the company to upgrade aging equipment and improve the yield and per
unit emissions performance associated with coating lines.

30
30
•
DaimlerChrysler’s NAP made over 90 operational and equipment changes utilizing the permits’
advance approval provisions between 1995 and 2000.  Advance approved modifications were made
to coating system components, coatings, cleaning activities, fuel-fired sources, source locations,
ventilation systems, and emissions control systems.
•
Lasco made five changes during the Title V permit term (as of July 2001) that utilized the advance
approval provisions.  The advance approvals enabled Lasco to add two new emissions units, increase
its stack height to remedy odor concerns, modify its emission factor to account for improved
emissions performance, and modify its control technology without requiring case-by-case permitting
actions.
•
Despite only having about one year of implementation experience under its flexible permit, Saturn has
made several of the changes outlined in its PSD permit application, including construction of the L850
engine line and the second assembly line in General Assembly.  Saturn reported that it is likely that
changes to existing emissions units have been made during the first year of the permit term (i.e., June
2000 to August 2001) that utilize the advance approval provision in permit condition B.10.1.  Saturn
is not required to maintain records of these changes, provided the changes meet established criteria
in the permit and plant-wide emissions remain below established caps.
•
Imation and Oklahoma DEQ reported that the Weatherford plant has made frequent use of the
flexibility provisions that advance-approve the use of alternative raw materials.  In at least four cases,
this included a streamlined toxics evaluation by the State, allowing the source to rapidly implement
raw material changes at the source.  Imation also utilized the advance approved alternative operating
scenarios for control devices and methods on three occasions.
 
In addition, some companies stated that the number of changes made is not the only indicator or importance
to them.  Equally important to them is the ability to make certain critical changes when other business factors
dictate.
Companies reported that the advanced approval provisions in the flexible permits fully addressed their
operational change needs.  With the exception of Lasco, the companies did not need to undertake any non-
advance approved construction permitting actions (e.g., minor NSR and major NSR) during their flexible
permit terms (i.e., typically a 5 year period).  Also, the permitting authorities indicated that the sources did not
make any changes under the advance approval provisions that were not authorized under the advance
approval provisions.
•
Lasco was required to submit a Notice of Construction permit application and seek a Title V permit
amendment to install a regenerative thermal oxidizer during the flexible permit term.  This was
necessary since this change was not advance approved in the permit, and since the change required
new MRR requirements.
Some companies did not utilize all of the flexibility provisions in their permits, but they anticipated
using these flexibility provisions in the future.
While all six companies utilized at least some of the flexibility provisions in their permits, not all flexibility
provisions had been used at the time of this review (with the exception of Intel).  Several sources indicated
that, while they can reasonably anticipate desired operational and equipment changes (or types of changes)
well in advance, the exact timing of change implementation is often influenced by multiple factors, such as
changing organizational investment priorities and resources and fluctuations in customer demand.  Companies
typically reported that they anticipate using their unused flexibility provisions later in their permit terms or

31
31
following permit renewal.  For example:
•
During the first 14 months under the flexible permit, Saturn did not implement the advance approval
provisions which allow construction of new emissions sources (i.e., permit condition B.10.2).  Saturn
and TDEC anticipate that this provision will be useful in the future to accommodate changes
associated with vehicle model year changeovers.
•
As of December 2001, the Weatherford site had not implemented two changes that were specifically
described in the advance approved minor NSR change provisions (i.e., permit condition Section H,
Subsection 2, Requirement 1b and 1c).  Imation indicated that the source may undertake these
changes in the future.
The flexible permits appear to accommodate a substantial number of advance approved changes while
providing sufficient clarity to support practical enforceability.
The permitting authorities indicated that the actual changes made under the flexible permits were fully
consistent with those envisioned during permit design and that the changes were made in a manner consistent
with the constraints imposed by the permits.  The flexible permits vary in the degree of specificity with which
advance approved modifications are described in the permits.  Each of the permits, however, imposes clear
boundaries for determining which changes would not be covered under the advance approval conditions.
Changes triggering new applicable requirements, including new or modified MRR requirements, that were
not already addressed in the permit, are subject to conventional permitting and approval procedures.
•
Changes advance approved in Intel’s Title V permit were clearly defined categorically and by
conditions documented in the permit.  For example, advance approved changes could only be made
at the stationary sources comprising Emissions Unit 1 (EU1); construction of entirely new stationary
sources are not covered; changes to a pollution control device are not covered; and no new applicable
requirement can be triggered by an advance approved change.  In addition, advance approved
changes must not result in source non-compliance with the VOC RACT requirement and the source
PSELs.
•
3M’s flexible permit contained specific categories of changes advance approved by the permit, such
as updating drive mechanisms and electrical components on coating equipment and replacing or
upgrading coater ovens, provided that 3M satisfied specific requirements described in the permit (e.g.,
remain below emissions caps and meet applicable New Source Performance Standards).  If 3M
desired to make a change not specifically covered by the listed advance approved categories of
changes, they would be required to proceed with a conventional permitting process for the
modification, unless MPCA agreed that the change was “consistent with” the changes advance
approved by the permit.
•
For DaimlerChrysler, some changes made under the flexible permit were not fully advance approved,
but were eligible to go through an expedited review process if all applicable requirements were met
and if no public hearing was requested during the public notice period.
Several companies reported that they did feel a need to contact their permitting authority during the permit
term to discuss or clarify whether a particular modification would be allowed under the advance approval
provisions in their pilot permit.
•
3M indicated that on two or three occasions, they contacted MPCA to discuss planned changes that
were not explicitly addressed by the permit but appeared to be covered by the “consistent with”

32
32
phrasing included in the permit. In each of these instances, MPCA indicated that the planned change
would not require a permitting action.
•
On one occasion, Lasco filed a Notice of Construction permit application to change the venting of
the regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO). After the application was submitted, OAPCA informed
Lasco that the proposed change was covered by the advance approval provisions and the application
was unnecessary.
Some companies indicated the flexible permits have facilitated an increase in the rate and a shift in
the type of changes made, when compared to a conventional permitting approach.
Some of the companies indicated that they would not have made certain changes, had such changes not been
advance approved in their flexible permit.  They typically stated that the time frames associated with
conventional minor NSR and other types of air permitting, as well as uncertainty regarding the applicability
of certain regulatory requirements, often creates sufficient “friction” (e.g., cost, delay, and risk) to make a
proposed change unattractive.  The EPA found evidence that proposed P2 changes are particularly vulnerable
to being shelved under a conventional permitting approach, since they often involve iterative experimentation
that could heighten regulatory transaction costs.  In addition, P2 modifications often receive lower
organizational investment priority unless they simultaneously address an important operational need.  Advance
approval provisions facilitated research and development into alternative processes.  When research
uncovered a promising process technique, the company could implement the change without waiting for case-
by-case approval and permitting.
 
•
Intel reported that successful pollution prevention initiatives directed at ongoing processes can be
iterative in nature.  The company typically conducts a series of experiments on its manufacturing
process to see if the changes produce the desired results.  Many of these individual changes could
be subject to construction permitting actions, thus imposing a stop-and-go aspect to the experimental
process.  Intel indicated that, under such conditions, operations personnel might well view
experimentation for purposes of pollution prevention as being very disruptive of the manufacturing
process and therefore recommend that it not proceed.
•
Lasco reported that the company is inclined not to make changes that have potential to trigger
additional air permitting requirements, attributing this reluctance to potential costs, delay, and
uncertainty associated with permitting actions.  For example, Lasco installed more complex putty
systems for attaching boards to the inside of bath units at other Lasco facilities to prevent the systems
from triggering air permitting requirements.  The advance approval provisions enabled Lasco to
incorporate a new putty station design into the product production line at the Yelm site in a
streamlined manner, resulting in material savings and VOC emissions reductions.
Finding 6: The flexible permits enhanced information sharing between the
companies and permitting authorities.
All six permitting authorities stated that the flexible permits enhanced their overall understanding of company
activities and emissions as compared to conventional permitting approaches.  The flexible permits did,
however, alter the timing and format of certain types of information, such as information regarding changes
implemented under advance approval provisions, when compared with information available under
conventional permits.  In several areas, such as plant-wide emissions performance and P2 performance, the

33
33
flexible permits typically required information that is not required by conventional permits.
The flexible permit development process provided permitting authorities with a clearer understanding
of the maximum plant-wide emissions levels anticipated during the permit terms.
The flexible permits provided clear information regarding the maximum level of emissions that would be
allowed during the permit term, in the form of established emissions caps.  If a source desired to exceed its
emissions cap, it would thereafter be required to undergo a major NSR permitting process that would require
public comment.  For example, in accepting the PTE cap of 249 tons/year of VOC emissions, Lasco had to
reduce its actual emissions, providing assurances to local residents that plant-wide emissions would thereafter
be held relatively steady, despite company plans to increase production during the permit term.
During permit development, companies were required to share more information regarding the type
of changes anticipated during the permit term, providing a more comprehensive, up-front picture of
anticipated operational activities and associated environmental performance than a conventional
permitting process.
The permitting authorities believe that the flexible permit development process, through the discussions of
advance approved changes, provided them with a clear advance understanding of the types of modifications
that the companies anticipated during the permit term.  Under a conventional permitting approach, change
information would typically only be available in a more fragmented, incremental manner, as companies
pursued approval to make changes on a case-by-case basis.  Under the flexible approach, applicable
requirements associated with each advance approved change are identified up-front in the permit, affording
a long-term view of potential applicable requirements, resulting emissions control requirements, and
environmental outcomes.  This enabled the permitting authority to have a more comprehensive picture of
changes, and associated environmental performance outcomes, that would likely occur over the permit term
(e.g., 5 years).
During permit implementation, information regarding changes made by the companies using the
advance approval provisions varied among the flexible permits but was generally comparable to or
greater than that produced under a conventional  permitting process; the flexible permits did alter the
timing and format of change information, as compared to conventional permitting approaches.
Variability is evident across the six flexible permits with respect to how advance approved changes were
required to be documented and reported.  Most of the flexible permits required some form of notices and/or
summary lists of advance approved changes made to be submitted to the permitting authority, in addition to
maintenance of an on-site log of advance approved changes.  At one end of the range, 3M was required to
submit advance notices and post-construction notices to MPCA for each change implemented using the
advance approval provisions (note:  during the permit term, MPCA eliminated the advance notice requirement,
streamlining relevant information into the post-construction notices).  3M was also required to submit annual
summaries of advance approved changes made during the year.  At the other end of the range, Intel’s permit
did not require the company to report information on specific changes implemented using the advance
approval provisions for a given six-month period if the maximum capacity to emit for the source declined
through P2 or other means during this period, when compared to the previous six-month period.  Saturn’s
permit requires the source to register new advance approved emissions sources with TDEC, although
reporting on specific advance approved changes to existing emissions sources listed in the permit is not

34
34
required.  Under the Intel and Saturn pilot permits, it is likely that less information on certain specific advance
approved changes was available to the permitting authorities, when compared with a conventional permitting
approach, in cases where such changes would have triggered the need for a NSR permit application.  This
assessment assumes that these advance approved changes would have been undertaken by the companies
under a conventional permitting approach.  The permitting authorities indicated that the information available
under the flexible permits was, at a minimum, sufficient to verify compliance with all applicable requirements
and to keep them appropriately informed of source activities.
Permitting authorities generally indicated that some form of recordkeeping and reporting regarding source
implementation of advance approved changes is important.  Inspectors with DNREC and OAPCA reported
that it is helpful to have information on changes made using advance approval provisions during their
inspections, whether this information was reported in advance or maintained in logs at the source.
Under a conventional permitting approach, a company typically submits a notice of construction or other such
permit application to the permitting authority for approval prior to implementing a change that triggers NSR.
These applications typically include specific information on proposed modifications.  In addition, companies
are generally required to submit a notice of completion to the permitting authority once the company has
finished “construction” of the change.  While the same type of change information is typically made available
under a flexible permit, the timing and format of the information differs from that required under a
conventional approach.  First, the advance approval provisions in flexible permits provide some information
at the beginning of the permit term regarding specific changes or categories of changes that are anticipated
during the permit term.  No such advance information is required under conventional permitting approaches.
Second, under flexible permits, companies generally do not submit permit applications for individual changes,
unless the changes are only partially advance approved.  Instead, information on actual changes made that
fit the advance approval descriptions is typically provided to the permitting authority soon after the change
is implemented, typically in the form of a post-construction notice.  In addition, most pilot sources operating
under flexible permits are required to record information on changes made using the advance approval
provisions in an on-site log that is available to agency inspectors.  Third, the flexible permits frequently require
some form of aggregated summary reporting on changes made using the advance approval provisions.  The
companies are typically required to list all advance approved changes made during a particular reporting
period, such as the past month, quarter, or year.  Permitting authorities indicated that the summary reporting
further helps to create an aggregated picture of changes made at the source, when compared with a series
of case-by-case permit applications in the agency file.
The section below discusses more detail regarding the timing, type, format, and accessibility of change
information available under the flexible permits.
•
3M’s permit required the company to provide written notice to MPCA for each change implemented
by the plant that utilized the advance approval provisions in the permit.  A written notice was due to
MPCA ten days prior to beginning actual construction and a subsequent notice was required to
MPCA two weeks after commencing operation.  In May 1996, MPCA representatives reported that
the agency believed that the post-commencement notice for changes was sufficient to provide the
agency and the public with a documented record of advance approved changes actually made at the
source.  3M was also required to submit an annual summary report of advance approved changes
implemented during the past year.
•
Imation is required to submit a notice of completion 30 days after the completion of construction of
advance approved changes.

35
35
•
Lasco’s flexible permit required the company to submit notices of construction completion to
OAPCA for each advance approved change undertaken.  Lasco is also required to maintain an on-
site log of changes implemented under the advance approval provisions.  The permit also requires
Lasco to submit a semi-annual summary of advance approved changes undertaken.
•
DaimlerChrysler is required to submit monthly reports listing changes made using the advance
approval provisions during the prior month.  The NAP is also required to maintain an on-site log of
changes made under these provisions and to submit an annual summary list of advance approved
changes implemented.
•
Saturn is required to register with TDEC new emissions sources constructed under the advance
approval provisions of the permit.  This registration includes the submission of a completed application
form, a brief process description, documentation of BACT or minor source BACT (for sources below
established emissions threshold levels) for the new source, and periodic monitoring parameters for
any control equipment.  The permit also requires Saturn to submit a plan to assess the emissions of
toxic, volatile pollutants from the source within two years of permit issuance.
•
Intel’s permit required the company to submit a list of advance approved changes made during each
six-month period, if there was a net increase in the maximum capacity to emit at the source for that
period, when compared with the maximum capacity to emit for the previous six-month period.  This
occurred once during the five-year permit term.
Several permitting authorities reported that they received more change information from companies operating
under the flexible permits than would have been available under a conventional permitting approach.  These
permitting authorities reported that the flexible permits encouraged sources to report on operational and
equipment changes, even if these changes would not have triggered minor NSR applicability under a
conventional approach.  Since the advance approval provisions removed the need to make case-by-case
determinations of NSR applicability for individual changes implemented during the permit term (companies
only needed to determine whether the changes satisfied the advance approval criteria specified in the permit)
companies tended to report more changes.  For example, 3M indicated that the company viewed the permit
as a valuable asset, and they indicated that they desired to protect this asset by ensuring a high level of
communication with MPCA.  Some permitting authorities indicated that the conventional NSR program may
sometimes create disincentives for companies to report changes for which the applicability of NSR is
uncertain, since such discussions with the permitting authority to determine applicability could prove time
intensive and lengthy.  Permitting authorities indicated that the flexible permits remove any incentive for
companies to “push the interpretation” of applicability determinations in a direction that would result in less
change reporting.
•
MPCA representatives reported that 3M reported information on changes that would not have
triggered minor NSR applicability under a conventional permitting approach, providing MPCA
inspectors and the public with more information on changes implemented at the source.
•
DNREC inspectors indicated that DaimlerChrysler reported information on changes beyond those
that would have been required under a conventional permitting approach.  The inspectors indicated
that this enhanced their understanding of company activities.
During permit implementation, the flexible permits required the provision of more comprehensive and
useful information on plant-wide emissions performance to permitting authorities.
Permitting authorities reported that the plant-wide emissions reporting required under the flexible permits
provides more comprehensive and easy-to-understand information on actual environmental performance

36
36
during the permit term.  In some cases, such as for the DaimlerChrysler and 3M permits, the frequency of
emissions reporting information was also greater than that typically required under a conventional permit.
Even when more frequent emissions reporting was not required, however, the companies were required to
maintain current emissions calculations on-site to demonstrate compliance with the established plant-wide
emissions caps.  The flexible permits all require companies to make these emissions calculations available to
permitting authority inspectors and personnel upon request.  Conventional permitting approaches typically
require preparation of an emissions inventory by the source on an annual basis.
 
•
DaimlerChrysler is required to submit monthly emissions reports to DNREC that include
comprehensive, plant-wide information on VOC and NOx emissions.  The monthly frequency of these
reports is greater than what would typically be available under conventional permits. 
•
The 3M flexible permit required the St. Paul Tape Plant to submit quarterly reports to MPCA on the
source’s plant-wide emissions.  The permit required 3M to report on all plant emissions units,
including those that had been ""grandfathered"" by the Clean Air Act.  These previously
“grandfathered” emissions units were also required to be included in the plant’s emissions monitoring
activities and enforceable compliance limits.  MPCA indicated that daily and annual rolling totals of
VOC emissions provided near ""real time"" information on actual plant-wide emissions.
•
The Intel Title V permit retained Intel’s original PSELs, pollutant-specific, plant-wide short-term and
annual caps on actual emissions.  Intel submitted semi-annual monitoring reports to Oregon DEQ
containing semi-annual compliance certification, emissions statements, and excess emissions upset
log. Since Oregon regulation required PSEL, Oregon DEQ stated that their emissions reporting was
very similar to that required by other Title V facilities in the State.
•
Oklahoma DEQ indicated that Imation’s flexible permit requires annual emissions reporting, similar
to that required under a conventional Title V permit, including annual compliance certification and an
annual emissions inventory.  Oklahoma DEQ indicated that the flexible permit incorporates a
previously “grandfathered” source that would not have been included in compliance reporting under
a conventional permit.
•
Under its flexible PSD permit, Saturn is required to monitor and log monthly plant-wide emissions
data which are maintained on-site and available for TDEC inspection.  Saturn and TDEC indicated
that plant-wide emissions reporting will be required in the forthcoming Title V permit for the source.
During permit implementation, four of the six flexible permits required companies to share information
regarding P2 activities and performance with the permitting authorities.  Conventional permits do not
typically require companies to share P2 information with the permitting authority or public. 
The flexible permits developed for Intel, Imation, and Lasco under EPA’s P4 program each require the
companies to implement P2 programs.  The companies were required to report information on their P2
programs to the permitting authority, in addition to periodic reports on P2 activities, accomplishments, and
performance.  DaimlerChrysler is also required to submit routine reports documenting P2 activities.
•
Imation’s implementation of a P2 program is voluntary, but there is an explicit link in the permit
between adoption of an approved pollution prevention program and the BACT determination for
advance approved changes.  Therefore, to access advance approvals that require BACT, Imation
must have an approved P2 program in place, which Imation did implement during the permit term.
The Lasco permit contained a similar connection between BACT and a P2 program.  The flexible
permit requires Imation to submit an annual P2 executive summary describing the pollution prevention
activities and programs adopted on site, as well as progress against a P2 target of 10 percent per unit

37
37
emissions reduction during the permit term.
•
Intel was required to submit an annual P2 progress report to Oregon DEQ, and a final report at the
end of the permit term.
•
DaimlerChrysler is required to report annually on their P2 activities as part of the annual compliance
certification.
•
Lasco is required to submit an annual P2 progress report, which documents P2 techniques, goals and
accomplishments.  Additionally, prior to the end of the third and fifth year of the permit term, Lasco
is to submit a report demonstrating compliance with the P2 Program.
Finding 7: The flexible permits generally provided to the public equivalent or
greater information than conventional permits.
The EPA’s examination of the public record and the availability of information to the public during the
development and implementation of the flexible permits indicates that the permits shifted the timing, type, and
format of information to the public on emissions performance, operational and equipment changes, and P2
activities.  As discussed in Finding 6 above, the six permits vary in the specific format, timing, and availability
of certain types of information required, particularly related to certain specific advance approved changes
implemented under the permits.  In areas such as plant-wide emissions performance and P2 information, most
of the flexible permits clearly increased the availability of information to the public.  In all six cases, the
permitting authorities indicated that, on balance, the flexible permits improved the availability of information
to the public.
During permit development, the flexible permitting efforts followed or exceeded the permitting
authorities’ conventional communications and public involvement procedures.
Permitting authorities indicated that the availability and flow of information to the pubic during the
development of the flexible permits satisfied or exceeded all requirements associated with the agency's
standard operating procedures for permit development.  This procedure typically includes making the draft
permit available to the public at the permitting authority offices and at a local public library, publishing notice
of the draft permit and public comment opportunities in one or more newspapers, holding a public comment
period (e.g., typically 30 days), and conducting a public hearing if requested by the public.  Some permitting
authorities also publicize draft permits on their website or through other communication mechanisms.
In four of the flexible permit development efforts, including the three permits developed under the EPA’s P4
program, the permitting authorities and companies voluntarily conducted one or more public meetings (i.e.,
in addition to any opportunity to hold a public hearing as part of the formal review process).  While these
meetings were not requested by the public, the permitting authorities and companies believed that the
innovative nature of the permits increased the importance of taking active steps to inform local communities
about the efforts.  In addition, several of the permits experienced local media coverage about the innovative
nature of the permits.
•
At the beginning of the flexible permit development effort in 1996, citizens of Yelm, Washington did
not view Lasco as a “good cooperate neighbor” due to past odor issues.  The subsequent level of
information flow to the public surrounding the Lasco permit development consisted of several
meetings, many public notices, and extensive communication between Lasco and OAPCA.  At the

38
38
end of the permit development process, the Sierra Club submitted a letter supporting Lasco's flexible
permit and thanking EPA Region 10, OAPCA, and Lasco for their proactive efforts to involve the
community in the permit development process.
•
Companies and permitting authorities involved in the development of the Imation, 3M, and Intel
flexible permits each deemed an up-front public meeting in conjunction with the public comment
period to be helpful in communicating to the public about the flexible permits, due to their innovative
nature.  In addition, the companies and permitting authorities were interested to understand early on
any potential public questions or concerns about the permits.  No adverse comments were
subsequently received from the public for any of these permits.
The flexible permit development process increases the availability of information to the interested
public regarding anticipated changes and emissions levels, as compared to a conventional permit
development process.
As discussed in Finding 6 above, the flexible permit development processes provided clear information to the
public regarding the maximum level of source emissions that would be allowed over the permit term, in the
form of established emissions caps.  Permitting authorities indicated that the emissions cap requirements in
the draft permits and communicated during public meetings (when held) provide useful information to
interested members of the public.  If a source desires to exceed its emissions cap, it would thereafter be
required to undergo a major NSR permitting process that would require public comment.  The Lasco example
demonstrates how such up-front information on total allowable plant-wide emissions can increase public
understanding of the permit and anticipated environmental performance.  In accepting the PTE cap of 249
tons/year of VOC emissions, Lasco had to reduce its actual emissions, providing assurances to local residents
that emissions would thereafter be held relatively steady, despite company plans to increase production during
the permit term.  This awareness allayed one of the key concerns voiced by members of the Yelm
community.
During development of the flexible permits, more information was available to interested members of the
public regarding the type of changes the sources anticipated making during the permit term, when compared
to a conventional permit development process.  As discussed in Finding 6, the permitting authorities believed
that the flexible permit development process, through the discussions of advance approved changes, provided
them and interested members of the public with a clear advance understanding of the types of modifications
that the sources planned to make during the permit term.  Under a conventional permitting approach, change
information would typically only be available in a more fragmented, incremental manner, as companies
pursued approval to make changes on a case-by-case basis.  Under the flexible approach, applicable
requirements associated with each advance approved change are identified up-front in the permit, affording
a long-term view of potential applicable requirements, resulting emissions control requirements, and
environmental outcomes.  This enabled the permitting authority and interested members of the public to have
a more comprehensive picture of changes, and associated environmental performance outcomes, that would
likely occur over the permit term.
During permit implementation, the flexible permits varied in the availability of information to the
public about plant-wide emissions, operational and equipment changes, and pollution prevention
activities; all permitting authorities indicated that, on balance, the flexible permits enhanced the
availability of information to the public as compared to information typically available under
conventional permitting approaches.

39
39
During permit implementation, the flexible permits required the provision of more comprehensive and, from
several of the permitting authorities’ perspectives, more useful information on plant-wide emissions
performance to permitting authorities.  As discussed in Finding 6, permitting authorities reported that the plant-
wide emissions reporting required under the flexible permits provides more comprehensive and easy-to-
understand information on actual environmental performance during the permit term.  In some cases, such
as for the DaimlerChrysler and 3M permits, the frequency of emissions reporting information was also greater
than that typically required under a conventional permit.  In other cases, such as for Imation and 3M, the
flexible permits required the companies to report emissions from previously “grandfathered” emissions
sources in their plant-wide emissions reporting.  For all the flexible permits, the reports containing information
on plant-wide emissions were available to the public in the permitting authorities’ files.
The EPA found that there are a variety of techniques for making information available to the public regarding
changes made using the advance approval provisions.  These techniques include advance notices, post-
construction notices, change registration, and periodic summaries of changes made (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
or annual).  For changes that do not meet the advance approval provisions, or that would cause a company
to increase its emissions caps, the company would be required to undergo a conventional permitting process
that would include submission of required application materials and completion of required public notice and
comment procedures.  When combined with the information on anticipated changes identified during the
permit development process, as well as information on plant-wide emissions and P2 activities, the permitting
authorities believe that flexible permits ensure the flow of sufficient information to enable the permitting
authorities to effectively enforce for all applicable requirements, to ensure that air quality is protected in
accordance with their SIPs, and to ensure consistency with the Clean Air Act’s intent to provide for effective
opportunities for public input into air permitting decisions.
As discussed in Finding 6, there was variability in the reporting requirements for changes implemented using
the advance approval provisions.  For four of the flexible permits, including those for 3M, DaimlerChrysler,
Imation, and Lasco, the EPA found that approximately equivalent information on advance approved changes
made was available to the public under the flexible permits, as compared to what permitting authorities
indicated would have been available under conventional permitting approaches.  In these cases, the timing
and format of the advance approved change information was shifted when compared to conventional
permitting approaches.  In general, more general information on advance approved changes was available
up-front during permit development, and more detailed information on specific changes made was available
in the form of notices and lists of changes made, as opposed to minor NSR construction permitting
applications.  In addition, MPCA and DNREC found that the companies reported changes in addition to those
that would likely have triggered minor NSR permit applications under a conventional permitting approach.
For the Intel and Saturn flexible permits, as discussed in Finding 6, more general information on anticipated
changes was available up-front during permit development, but less information on individual changes
implemented using the advance approval provisions was available during permit implementation when
compared to a conventional permitting approach, assuming that these changes would have been made under
a conventional permitting approach.
During permit implementation, four of the flexible permits required companies to report information regarding
P2 activities and performance to the permitting authorities.  This information is available to interested
members of the public through the permitting authority files for these sources.  P2 information would not
typically be available to the public under a conventional permitting approach.
•
The Imation pilot permit required the company to submit annual P2 reports to Oklahoma DEQ
describing the P2 activities and programs adopted at the site, as well as progress against an

40
40
established P2 target.  This information is available to the public in the permitting authority’s files.
•
Intel was required to submit an annual P2 progress report to Oregon DEQ, and a final report at the
end of the permit term.  This information is available to the public in the permitting authority’s files.
•
DaimlerChrysler is required to report annually on their P2 activities.  This information is available to
the public in the permitting authority’s files.
•
Lasco is to submit an annual P2 progress report, which documents P2 techniques, goals, and
accomplishments.  Additionally, prior to the end of the third and fifth year of the permit term, Lasco
is to submit a report demonstrating compliance with the P2 Program.  This information is available
to the public in the permitting authority’s files.
Finding 8: The flexible permits produced or are likely to produce net financial
benefits to companies and permitting authorities.
Companies and permitting authorities reported that the flexible permits have resulted in net financial benefits,
or that they anticipate that this will be the case.  Companies and permitting authorities indicated that initial
permit development costs exceeded those required to develop conventional permits, due to factors related to
the pilot nature of the permits, as well as to factors inherent to developing flexible permitting techniques.  In
each case, however, companies and permitting authorities reported that the flexibility provisions have
decreased, or are expected to decrease, the administrative costs of operating under the permit sufficiently
to more than offset the higher initial permit development costs.
Permit development costs for the flexible permits were significant, but these higher costs were largely
attributed to the pilot nature of the permits.
Companies and permitting authorities involved in the flexible permitting efforts reported that the costs,
primarily resulting from staff time devoted to development of the flexibility provisions, were greater than those
typically experienced in the development of conventional permits.  
•
MPCA representatives estimated that about 1000 hours of MPCA staff time were devoted to
development of the permit.  MPCA representatives noted that a primary factor contributing to the
length of the permit development was that this was the first flexible permit developed in Minnesota,
as well as one of the first developed and issued in the U.S.
•
The development of Lasco’s flexible Title V permit spanned approximately 16 months, from initiation
of discussions (e.g., P4 group discussions) until the permit was issued.  However, in addition to this
being a team-oriented “demonstration” project necessitating additional review and public participation
(see below), this was OAPCA’s first Title V permit.  OAPCA representatives reported that these
factors contributed to the overall length of the permit development process.  In the future, OAPCA
indicated that flexible Title V permits will likely take only slightly more time to develop and issue than
conventional Title V permits (e.g., approximately 180 hours versus 160 hours).
Permitting authorities indicated that a substantial amount of the higher permitting costs were attributable to
the pilot nature of the permits.  These pilot costs stemmed partly from the need for frequent conference calls
or meetings between the permitting authorities, the EPA Regional Offices, and the EPA headquarters to
ensure the flexible permitting techniques would be approved by the EPA in the absence of guidance on
flexible permitting.  Additional costs also resulted from the fact that each of the six flexible permits were the
first developed under these permitting authorities’ jurisdictions, and there was limited national experience with

41
41
specific flexibility provisions from which to draw upon.  Permitting authorities indicated that the pilot-related
transaction costs would likely be reduced significantly or eliminated if the EPA were to issue guidance and/or
rulemaking that clarified the flexible permitting approaches and techniques that are acceptable to the EPA.
Some portion of the higher permit development costs, however, were associated with tailoring of flexible
permitting techniques to address the specific applicable requirements, needs, and circumstances of the
sources.  Permitting authorities and companies indicated that these costs would be incurred in the
development of any new permit containing flexibility provisions, even if the use of flexible permitting
techniques becomes routine and is supported by EPA guidance or rulemaking.  For example, communications
between the companies and permitting authorities regarding the changes that companies’ anticipate making
during the permit term are typically necessary to develop advance approval provisions.  Other flexible
permitting techniques, such as the development of replicable operating and testing procedures and streamlining
of applicable requirements, also entail more significant interactions between a company and permitting
authority during permit development.
•
3M and MPCA reported that additional time was required during permit development to develop the
advance approval descriptions.  This involved discussions to identify the specific changes and
categories of changes that 3M anticipated making during the permit term.
Companies and permitting authorities that have renewed their flexibility provisions in subsequent permits
indicated that the renewal costs have been minimal, as compared to costs required under a conventional
permit renewal process.  While some advance approval provisions may need to be updated at permit renewal,
to accommodate new change needs anticipated by the company over the subsequent permit term, this process
generally requires significantly less company and permitting authority resources than were required for the
initial development of flexibility provisions for the source.  This means that potential financial benefits for
companies and permitting authorities can be extended to subsequent permit terms.
•
Oregon DEQ incorporated many of Intel’s flexibility provisions into the company’s subsequent
synthetic minor air permit without requiring additional permitting authority resources.
•
DNREC reported that it was able to incorporate the flexibility provisions in DaimlerChrysler’s original
pilot flexible permit into the company’s Title V air operating permit without requiring resources
beyond those necessary to issue a conventional Title V permit.
Companies and permitting authorities reported that they experienced financial benefits from
implementation of the flexible permits that more than offset the higher up-front permit development
costs.
Companies and permitting authorities reported that financial benefits arose during permit implementation from
the reduced administrative costs associated with company operational and equipment changes made under
the advance approval provisions.  Companies indicated that the advance approval provisions reduced the staff
time and resources necessary to implement changes covered by these provisions.  Company personnel found
that they did not need to perform detailed applicability determinations for individual changes, provided that the
changes satisfied the advance approval conditions listed in the permit.  Such applicability determinations for
advance approved changes were performed during permit development and clarified in the permit.
Companies indicated that this streamlined applicability determination process and the improved certainty
related to how changes would be addressed under the permit reduced the companies’ staff time needed to
process changes.  Further savings resulted from the companies’ reduced need to prepare applications for

42
42
construction permits and/or permit modifications for individual changes, due to the advance approval
provisions.  Companies indicated that the time necessary to complete permitting authority notifications of
advance approved changes and/or to record such changes in on-site logs was significantly less than the staff
time necessary to prepare permit applications under a conventional permitting approach.
•
DaimlerChrysler representatives estimated that the flexible permits save the company significant staff
time that would have been associated with applicability determinations and permit actions for changes
made using the advance approval provisions.  They estimated that approximately 505 hours of staff
time were saved under the initial flexible permit.  These savings are projected to increase in the
future as the company makes more changes utilizing the advance approval provisions in the permit.
•
Under a conventional permit, Intel would have needed to prepare approximately 150 to 200 notice
of construction applications per year (that were not required under the flexible permit).  Intel
estimated that each application would have required an average of approximately 8 hours, resulting
in 1,200 to 1,600 hours of staff time per year.
•
Lasco estimated that to execute a construction permit requires approximately 50 staff hours.
Additionally, to process a permit modification, Lasco would need to submit a pubic notice (with an
estimated cost of $350) and to hold a public hearing (with an estimated cost of $400).  For all five
changes made using the advance approval provisions, Lasco estimated a cost savings of more than
$20,000.
Permitting authorities also reported that they have experienced, or anticipate experiencing, administrative cost
savings during permit implementation.
•
MPCA representatives indicated that they view flexible permits as saving agency resources by
reducing the number of case-by-case change reviews and permitting actions.  MPCA estimated that
each of their minor NSR permit actions (if straightforward) require an average level of effort
equivalent to approximately $1,000, and 3M estimated that approximately 15 to 20 of the 34 changes
undertaken likely would have required a minor permitting action.  From MPCA’s standpoint then, the
flexible permit provided an administrative savings benefit of between $15,000 and $20,000.  Further,
3M indicated at least two of their changes may have been major permit actions requiring
approximately 100 hours of processing by MPCA.  At $125 per hour, this would represent an
additional savings to MPCA of $25,000.
•
Oklahoma DEQ representatives stated that the Imation permit has saved time for DEQ personnel,
enabling them to “operate more effectively” with their limited staff.  They indicated that most of the
time savings result from the reduced need for administrative processing of case-by-case construction
permitting actions and air toxics approvals.  DEQ representatives stated that they have identified at
least five changes made under the advance approval provisions that would have required a permitting
action under a conventional permitting approach, but that only required written notices under the
flexible Title V permit.  They indicated that, minus the flexibility provisions, each of these permitting
actions would have required a 45-day review and approval process that could have extended well
beyond that in some cases.  They further indicated that this resource savings enables DEQ to focus
scarce resources on inspections and other environmental and permitting priorities.
•
The Intel permit saved Oregon DEQ significant staff time associated with processing notice of
construction applications from Intel.  Intel estimated that in the absence of the flexible permit, Oregon
DEQ would have needed to process approximately 150 to 200 additional notice of construction
applications per year.  Even at a very low estimate of two staff hours per application, the staff time
implications are significant (e.g., 300 to 400 hours).

43
43
•
During the flexible permit term, Lasco made five advance approved changes that would have
otherwise triggered case-by-case minor NSR permit actions.  OAPCA estimated that Lasco’s
flexible permit saved them approximately 20 to 40 staff hours per advance approved change. The
time savings includes time spent drafting a permit to construct, ensuring NAAQS compliance,
modifying the Title V permit, and conducting the change-specific public review process. At $75/hour,
the estimated administrative costs saved by the flexible permit for all five advance approved
conditions ranges from $7,500 to $15,000.
•
TDEC reported that the Saturn flexible permit has reduced agency paperwork associated with
processing individual construction permit applications and permit modifications, allowing agency staff
to focus on higher environmental priorities.  They further indicated that the permit saved TDEC
significant staff time associated with processing notice of construction applications from Saturn.  The
permit eliminates the need for full minor NSR permitting.  Traditionally, permitting for minor NSR
takes approximately 24 to 40 staff hours, plus issuance of a public notice and a town meeting or
public hearing.  This process has been streamlined to a State control technology review for new unit
additions not subject to major BACT.  TDEC representatives believe that during the life of the permit,
TDEC will need to invest less hours of staff time to address the future air permitting needs associated
with the Saturn plant, due to the anticipated future use of the advance approval provisions. 
It should be noted that companies and permitting authorities cautioned that it is difficult to precisely estimate
cost savings and financial benefits associated with flexible permit implementation, since it involves comparison
with hypothetical experience under a conventional permitting approach.  Companies and permitting authorities
noted that the flexible permit provisions sufficiently altered the applicability determination for individual
changes so as to make it difficult to retrospectively determine the precise level of effort and timing that would
have been necessary to accommodate the changes under a conventional permitting approach.  That said,
companies and permitting authorities indicated that the estimated financial benefits identified in this report
provide a reasonable approximation of the financial benefits that resulted from implementation of the flexible
permits, compared to those costs that would likely have been expected had the companies been operating
under conventional permits.
In additional to administrative cost savings, several companies identified financial benefits stemming from the
ability to implement advance approved changes without the potential delay associated with conventional
permitting time frames.  Several companies indicated that this streamlined ability to implement advance
approved changes improved the predictability of change implementation time frames for project planning and
avoided what can be substantial opportunity costs.  They further reported that this predictability and
elimination of potential delay from air permitting provided important competitive advantages that enabled them
to compete more effectively.
•
From 3M’s perspective, the flexible permit allowed the company to proceed as needed with
operational change.  This was critical from two perspectives:  it allowed the plant to avoid acting as
a bottleneck along the critical path of any particular product line that would be moving among 3M
plants; and it allowed the plant to remain highly responsive to its marketplace and avoid either lost
sales and/or permanent loss of market share.  3M did indicate that the changes made that potentially
involved PSD permitting likely would not have been undertaken if handled on a conventional basis.
•
DaimlerChrysler representatives indicated that the permit has increased the company’s ability to
respond to short-term changes in market demand, as well as to accommodate the tight project time
lines associated with periodic model changeovers.  DNREC and DaimlerChrysler representatives
reported that under a conventional permitting approach, some of these changes would likely have
triggered case-by-case applicability determinations and potential permitting actions that could have

5Estimates from Intel of the number of changes made per year under the flexible permit that would have
triggered the need for notice of construction approval under a conventional permit.
6Under Oregon rules, ODEQ has up to 60 days to process notice of construction approval applications. 
Twenty-one days was selected as a reasonable estimate of the average actual time associated with receiving notice
of construction approval from ODEQ.
44
44
extended to 6 to 9 months each.
•
The advance approved changes in Intel’s flexible permit likely saved the Intel Aloha plant hundreds
of business days associated with making operational and process changes to ramp up production for
new products, respond to market demands, and optimize production processes.  Industry estimates
of the opportunity costs of production downtime and time delays run as high as several million dollars
in just a few days due to lost sales to computer makers and other factors.  The estimated 150 to 200
changes per year5, combined with the Oregon DEQ approval time frame of up to 60 days per
change6, indicate that there would likely have been significant delay under a conventional permitting
approach.  Even if few delays would have resulted in production downtime or missed market
opportunities, the costs would likely have been significant, as many of the changes improved the cost-
competitiveness of Intel’s products.  Intel representatives indicated that it is likely that the impact of
continued time delays would be to redirect Intel’s production investment and operating facilities to
locations more conducive to change.
•
Imation representatives reported that the flexibility provisions in the Title V permit enabled the
company to experiment with new materials and to introduce the production of new products at the
Weatherford plant with minimal delay associated with air permitting and material toxicity
assessments.  Under the flexibility provisions, Imation is authorized to use alternative raw materials
without receiving case-by-case approval or permit modifications that typically can take  two to three
months, provided that they follow established procedures and ensure emissions remain below
specified limits.  Even for materials for which Oklahoma had not previously reviewed, DEQ agreed
to complete toxicity evaluations and establish MAAC limits within 72 hours of receiving a request
from Imation.  Imation representatives stated that these streamlined administrative procedures for
addressing Oklahoma’s air toxics requirements have eliminated air permitting delay associated with
raw material changes.  Among other product transitions, the flexibility provisions in the Title V permit
have facilitated Imation’s development of digital proofing films for graphic design applications.  In
addition to various product quality benefits, digital proofing films also require fewer coating layers
during manufacturing than conventional proofing films.  This results in fewer VOC emissions from
solvents per unit.  While customer demand for digital proofing materials is increasing, it is likely to
take several years before digital proofing technology is in widespread use, due to the cost of
converting to digital proofing hardware.
•
Lasco engaged in a series of advance approved changes, updated its emission factor, and voluntarily
installed an RTO.  These actions combined to create “head room” under Lasco’s cap, which Lasco
then used to increase production.  Lasco indicated that typically (and as reflected by the Yelm plant’s
lack of operational change prior to the flexible permit and experience at other Lasco facilities) the
company is very averse to making changes that trigger permitting actions.  At most, they wait to
undertake such changes at the time of permit renewal. Contrary to its typical corporate behavior,
Lasco Yelm engaged in a series of modifications that created  the opportunity to increase production
from 126,045 units/year (in 1997) to 132,548 units/year (in 2000) generating a significant annual
increase in profit.  In 2001, after the RTO was installed, Lasco decreased emissions per unit further
to 3.13 lbs./unit, allowing production to increase to 147,429 units and reducing costs associated with

45
45
styrene loss.
•
Saturn indicated that the flexible permit was a principle factor in General Motors’ selection of the
source to manufacture the L850 engine, leading to the creation of 700 jobs.  Saturn was awarded the
contract primarily because it could implement the necessary changes within 24 months and
accommodate future changes with minimal delay.  The flexible PSD permit is enabling Saturn to add
and modify coating, assembly and machining lines in a timely manner, while ensuring that best
available pollution control technologies are installed and that air emissions remain under approved
limits. Using a combination of the PAL emissions caps and advanced approvals, the flexible permit
will allow Saturn to upgrade the plant over the next few years, with minimal delays, to produce
several new vehicles, including Saturn’s new fuel-efficient sport utility vehicle, the Saturn VUE™.
Saturn representatives stated that the flexible permit avoids a potential NSR backlog associated with
the conventional permitting process, thereby providing a competitive advantage to Saturn.
Finding 9:  Permitting authorities are generally supportive of flexible permits
as an option.
The permitting authorities reported that they are pleased with the benefits from the flexible permits.
Additionally, they believe flexible permitting techniques are useful tools to address some companies’
operational flexibility needs, to foster environmental improvements through emissions reductions, and to lessen
permitting authority resource needs and backlogs associated with construction permitting, so that these public
agencies can focus resources on higher environmental management priorities.  Finding 10 discusses permitting
authority perspectives on matching flexibility provisions with appropriate source candidates. 
Permitting authorities are supportive of flexible permits, and they expressed their interest to renew the
pilot flexible permits and to expand the use of flexible permits in their jurisdictions.
Permitting authorities demonstrated their support of flexible permits by retaining the flexibility provisions in
the subsequent permit for the source, or by indicating their interest to do so.
•
Oregon DEQ retained the advance approval provisions in Intel’s synthetic minor air operating permit
that replaced the Aloha plant’s Title V permit in 1999.
•
MPCA indicated that the agency is supportive of renewing 3M’s flexibility provisions in the
forthcoming Title V permit.  In discussing options for the plant’s Title V permitting application (under
consideration by MPCA at the time of the EPA review), however, 3M management decided not to
pursue such provisions due to uncertainty surrounding how the next VOC emissions limit would be
defined.  3M voiced concerns that significantly lowered emissions caps could constrain the plant’s
ability to accommodate increased product demand or transfers of product lines from other 3M
facilities.
•
DNREC supported the renewal of all flexibility provisions from DaimlerChrysler’s initial flexible
construction and air operating permit into the plant’s Title V permit, issued in October 1999.
Two permitting authorities further demonstrated their support of flexibility provisions by incorporating
flexibility techniques into permits for other sources within their jurisdiction.
•
MPCA reported that the agency has issued “dozens” of minor source and synthetic minor source

46
46
permits that include flexibility provisions (e.g., plant-wide emissions caps and advance approval
provisions) since the issuance of the 3M St. Paul Tape Plant pilot permit in 1993.  MPCA also issued
a permit to 3M’s Maplewood, Minnesota research and development plant that included an advance
approved BACT determination.
•
DNREC has issued a Title V permit for DuPont’s Edge Moor, Delaware plant that includes PALs
and advance approval provisions, as well as several permits containing alternate operating scenarios.
Permitting authorities indicated that finalization of EPA policy and/or guidance on flexible permitting
would increase their interest and efficiency in expanding the use of flexible permits.
Permitting authorities indicated that finalization of rulemaking and/or guidance related to flexible permitting
is desired to provide greater clarity and certainty around the EPA’s expectations.  Most permitting authorities
stated that, while they are supportive of flexible permitting approaches, they are somewhat hesitant to invest
resources of any significant amount into new flexible permits in the absence of increased clarity regarding
approaches that are acceptable to the EPA.  Permitting authorities generally did not want to find themselves
in a position where they have developed numerous flexible permits based on an approach or regulatory
interpretation that does not correlate with the EPA’s approved flexible permitting rules and/or guidance
developed at some point in the future.
Several permitting authorities also noted the high transaction costs associated with developing “pilot” permits
as an additional deterrent to expanding the use of flexibility techniques without EPA policy or guidance.  Pilot
initiatives typically demand a high level of interaction between the permitting authority, EPA Regional Offices,
and various offices within the EPA headquarters to verify that the pilot approaches are acceptable.
Permitting authorities indicated that EPA policy and/or guidance could reduce the amount of time spent in
conference calls and meetings, and in the development of flexible permit language that does not meet the
EPA’s expectations, while also reducing the overall time frame for developing a flexible permit.  One
permitting authority believed that additional guidance was not needed for it to act but agreed with the other
permitting authorities that EPA rules and/or guidance on flexible permitting might serve to improve the
consistency of regulatory interpretations, expectations, and comments communicated by various EPA offices
and regions.
While permitting authorities supported promulgation of EPA policy and/or guidance on flexible permitting, they
hoped that any such policy would be accommodative of the approaches employed in the pilot flexible permits.
In addition, DNREC representatives urged the EPA to not be overly prescriptive in any policy or guidance
and to allow permitting authorities reasonable discretion in the implementation of approved flexibility
techniques.
Permitting authorities stated that various forms of EPA outreach, training, and assistance would be
useful to assist permitting authorities to develop effective flexible permits.
Permitting authorities and companies emphasized that the EPA could take several steps, in addition to
promulgation of flexible permitting policy and/or guidance, to support the implementation of effective flexible
permits.  Suggestions included:
•
Make documentation available regarding flexible permitting techniques.  Materials should include
examples of flexible permits, fact sheets on various flexible permitting approaches and tools, draft
permit language related to various flexibility approaches, training materials, and other resources.
•
Formalize a network of EPA flexible permitting experts who would be available to support permitting
authorities interested to develop permits containing flexibility provisions.

47
47
•
Conduct workshops and training sessions for EPA and permitting authority personnel who are
interested to learn about flexible permitting techniques.  Similar workshops or training sessions could
be designed for sources to help them determine whether or not they may be appropriate candidates
for flexible permitting techniques.
•
Develop a tool to assist sources and permitting authorities to determine the appropriateness of flexible
permitting techniques to potential source candidates.
•
Develop an EPA website clearinghouse for information on flexible permitting techniques.
Finding 10:  Permitting authorities indicated that flexible permit provisions
should be matched with a company’s need for flexibility and technical capacity
to implement effectively its flexible permit requirements.
Permitting authorities indicated that while they believe flexible permitting techniques to be appropriate and
beneficial for use with some companies, they may not be appropriate for all companies.  They indicated that
there are two critical factors that should be considered when determining the appropriateness of flexible
permitting  for candidate sources.  First, the company should be able to demonstrate that it has a need for the
flexibility.  Second, the permitting authority should be confident that the source has sufficient capacity to
operate effectively under a flexible permit, which typically includes additional monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting requirements.
Permitting authorities believe that a candidate company should be able to demonstrate sufficient need
for flexibility to justify the additional up-front staff time and resources needed for the permitting
authority to tailor flexible permitting techniques to the source.
Permitting authorities indicated that they want to have some assurance that any additional up-front investment
will result in benefits for the company, permitting authority, and/or environment before investing in the
development of a flexible permit.  Such need could be demonstrated by a company’s ability to clearly
articulate its operational change needs.  Permitting authorities indicated that some companies seldom
implement changes that trigger air permitting requirements, making them less appropriate candidates for
flexible permits.
Permitting authorities indicated that a candidate company should exhibit the technical capacity to
operate effectively under a flexible permit, as indicated by factors such as the source’s compliance
history, attentiveness to pollution prevention, and ability to track and manage operational changes and
emissions.
Permitting authorities indicated that while they believe company compliance with flexible permits to be fully
verifiable and enforceable, they believe that companies lacking sufficient capacity to operate effectively under
a flexible permit could be at an increased risk of non-compliance.  Additional monitoring, reporting, and
recordkeeping conditions, such as the calculation of plant-wide emissions and maintenance of logs
documenting operational changes and alternate operating scenarios, are typically required to assure
compliance with flexible permit provisions.  Permitting authorities indicated that some companies may not
have sufficient capacity and capabilities to effectively meet such permit requirements on a sustained basis.
Permitting authorities stated that they view a company’s past compliance history as the primary indicator of
the company’s capacity to operate under a flexible permit.  Past patterns of compliance violations often signal
that a company is not sufficiently able to handle additional monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting

48
48
requirements necessary under a flexible permit.  Permitting authorities pointed to several other indicators of
a company’s capacity to operate effectively and in compliance under a flexible permit.  These include:
•
A company’s capacity to track and manage operational and equipment changes.
•
A company’s ability to accurately monitor plant-wide emissions.
•
A company’s track record of communication and openness with the permitting authority.
•
The presence of trained personnel at the source who understand air requirements.
•
The presence of a P2 program and/or a track record of P2 accomplishment.
Permitting authorities indicated, however, that rigid criteria for determining the appropriateness of flexible
permitting techniques for a company candidate, such as the complete absence of historic compliance
violations, should not be established.  They indicated that permitting authority personnel are accustomed to
matching appropriate permitting techniques and requirements to address individual sources’ applicable
requirements and circumstances.

7The permit expires on December 31, 2005, but the plant-wide applicability limits (PALs) extend to July 2010.

TIP COMMENTS ON EPA PROPOSED DISAPPROVAL OF TCEQ
QUALIFIED FACILITY PROGRAM RULES AND GENERAL DEFINITIONS
Docket ID No. EPA–R06–OAR–2005-TX-0025
74 Fed. Reg. 48,450 (Sept. 23, 2009)
The Texas Industry Project (“TIP”) submits the following comments in response 
to the proposed disapproval of Texas's state implementation plan (“SIP”) revisions relating to 
Qualified Facilities and general definitions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(“EPA”), published in the Federal Register on September 23, 2009.  TIP is comprised of 62 
companies in the chemical, refining, oil and gas, electronics, forest products, terminal, electric 
utility, and transportation industries with operations in Texas.1  
I.
Introduction
TIP strongly supports full approval of the Qualified Facility provisions and 
definitions.  The Texas air quality permitting program, including the Qualified Facility 
provisions, is stringent, comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.  
Under Texas’s integrated air permitting regime, air quality in the state is 
demonstrating strong, sustained improvement.  Between 1999 and 2005, NOX emissions in the 
Houston-Galveston area decreased from almost 1,200 tons per day, to under 600 tons per day.2  
Ozone as measured under the one-hour standard in the Houston-Galveston area has declined 
from 220 parts per billion (“ppb”) in 1991 to 127 ppb in 2009.3  Under the eight-hour standard, 
ozone in the Houston-Galveston area has declined from 119 ppb in 1991, to 84 ppb in 2009.4  .5

Moreover, between 1988 and 2008, there has been an 80% reduction in VOC compound 
indicators in the Houston area.6  There has been a similar improvement in toxic air emissions.  
Between 2003 and 2008, there has been a 50% decrease in highly reactive volatile organic 
compounds (“HRVOCs”) in the Houston area.7  Similarly, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, ozone 
as measured under the one-hour standard declined from 140 ppb in 1991 to 115 ppb in 2009.8  
Ozone for the Dallas-Fort Worth area under the eight-hour standard has declined from 105 ppb 
in 1991 to 86 ppb in 2009  Notably, according to recent TCEQ review, all areas of Texas are in 
attainment for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.9
Further, the data show that stationary sources have contributed more substantial 
emissions reductions than any other category during the period of most dramatic air quality 
improvements.  In the Houston-Galveston area between 1993 and 2008, NOX emissions from 
stationary sources declined from 695 tons per day (“tpd”), to 156 tpd, a decrease of 539 tpd.10  
During that same period, emissions from on-road source declined from 416 tpd to 175 tpd, a 
decrease of 241 tpd.11  Similarly, stationary sources made significant decreases for VOC.  
Between 1993 and 2009 in the Houston-Galveston area, VOC emissions from stationary sources 
decreased from 411 tpd, to 170 tpd, a decrease of 241 tpd.12  On-road sources from that same 
period decreased from 199 tpd, to 86 tpd, a decrease of 113 tpd.13  As the figures indicate, 
stationary sources in Texas have made the most significant strides in reducing emissions.
The submitted revisions strengthen a previously SIP-approved Texas program. 
Under the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “Act”), SIP revisions are approved when those
revisions do not interfere with the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(“NAAQS”).  States have the primary responsibility for developing plans for the attainment and 
maintenance of the NAAQS.  In fact, as the Fifth Circuit recently explained:
Although EPA is required to approve SIPs that provide for the timely 
attainment and subsequent maintenance of primary and secondary ambient 
air standards as well as satisfy other CAA general requirements, see 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(a)(3), the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a

State’s choices of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that 
otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(2).14
Rather, the proper test for determining whether a SIP revision can be approved is whether the 
revision interferes with attainment of the NAAQS (i.e. that the plan does not make air quality 
worse).15  The last ten years have seen an unprecedented improvement in Texas air quality.  The 
submitted revisions have been fully integrated components of the Texas air quality permitting 
program for all that time.  Because the current SIP submittals function to strengthen the existing 
SIP, such submittal does not raise interference concerns, and should be fully approved.
II.
Background on the Qualified Facilities Program
A.
Overview
The Texas Qualified Facility program is a minor New Source Review (“minor 
NSR”) applicability trigger.  Under the program, existing emissions units (defined in the Texas 
rules as “existing facilities”) that employ up-to-date best available control technology (“BACT”) 
may make physical and operational changes without a minor NSR review, so long as the changes 
do not result in net emissions increases above their current, protective limits.16  
The Qualified Facilities program is statutory.  All of its key provisions are laid out 
in the Texas Clean Air Act.17
The program applies to “existing facilities.”  A “facility” is defined as “[a] 
discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure that constitutes or 
contains a stationary source, including appurtenances other than emission control equipment.”18   
Notably, the definition of “facility” here is similar to the federal definition of “emissions unit,” 
used in Texas’s Title V program.19  
Qualified facilities may make physical or operational changes so long as the 
change does not result in a net increase in allowable emission of any air contaminant or the 
emission of any new air contaminant.  Changes that meet this criterion are not considered 
“modifications” subject to minor NSR review by TCEQ.20  
The program only reaches changes to an existing facility.21  Thus, the program 
does not authorize the construction of new facilities.

The Texas Legislature established the Qualified Facility program in order to 
provide additional incentives for sites to employ up-to-date (i.e., no more than 10-year-old) 
BACT.  Accordingly, a facility may remain a Qualified Facility only so long as it (1) was issued 
a permit or permit amendment or was exempted from pre-construction permit requirements no 
earlier than 120 months before the change will occur, or (2) uses air pollution control methods 
that are at least as effective as the BACT that was required or would have been required for the 
same class or type of facility by a permit issued 120 months before the change will occur.22  
Status as a qualified facility is not perpetual.  A facility may lose its status as a 
qualified facility if its permit, exemption or control method falls outside the 10-year window.  
“For example, if a facility obtained a permit on January 15, 1991, it would be a qualified facility 
on the basis of the permit until January 14, 2001, and would be eligible to have changes made 
under the qualified facility flexibility.   After that date, the facility is no longer eligible to have 
changes made under the qualified facility flexibility unless the status as a qualified facility is 
continued or regained by a subsequent permit action or appropriate control methods.”23  
B.
The Qualified Facility Program Safeguards Major NSR
TCEQ rules ensure that the Qualified Facility flexibility is not to be used to 
circumvent federal NSR.  Section 116.117(a)(4) requires that an owner or operator wishing to 
use the program must document: 
[S]ufficient information as necessary to show that the project will comply with 
§116.150 and §116.151 of this title (relating to Nonattainment Review) and §§ 
116.160-116.163 of this title (relating to Prevention of Significant Deterioration 
Review) . . . .24
Additionally, §116.117(d) states that “[n]othing in this section shall limit the applicability of any 
federal requirements.”25  To ensure that the regulated community understands the federal NSR 
safeguards, the associated TCEQ guidance document states:
SB 1126 only revised the Texas “minor new source review” program to allow 
some changes to be made without a requirement to obtain a permit or other 
“approval” from the [TCEQ].  SB 1126 does not supersede federal requirements 
such as Nonattainment (NA) review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration 
(PSD) review of new major sources and major modifications to existing sources, 
which are incorporated into Chapter 116.  . . .  In making changes under SB 1126, 
owners and operators must consider the potential for these other federal and sate 
requirements to limit their ability to make a desired change.  The owner/operator

is responsible for ensuring that any change to a facility complies with all 
applicable regulations.26
TCEQ guidance also specifically states that the program does not supersede other state 
regulations on emissions or TCEQ’s powers and duties to take action to control air pollution.
TCEQ guidance also addresses the interplay of changes under the Qualified 
Facility program and special conditions in the permits a facility holds.  “If a change made under 
the qualified facility flexibility would result in the violation of a permit special condition, the 
permit holder must revise the permit special conditions to stay in compliance with the permit,”27
through either the permit alteration process of 30 TAC §116.116(c) or the notification process of 
30 TAC § 116.117(d).  As explained above, 30 TAC § 116.117(d) states that “[n]othing in this 
section shall limit the applicability of any federal requirements.”  Thus, any changes to a facility 
must comply with federal NSR and PSD rules.
C.
The Qualified Facility Program Exceeds Federal Benchmarks for 
Allowables-Based Minor NSR Triggers
As outlined above, the Qualified Facility program is a minor NSR applicability 
trigger.  As such, the program is one of the flexibility mechanisms encouraged by EPA in its 
2009 Flexible Air Permitting Rule.28  In reflecting on its decade-long flexible permit pilot 
program, EPA observed:
Upon examining the provisions of their minor NSR programs, most of the 
States in which pilot permits were conducted . . .  found that they could 
issue advance approvals under existing minor NSR authority for a wide 
spectrum of changes, provided that certain boundary conditions were 
established in the minor NSR permit.29
The Texas Qualified Facility program functions in a similar manner.  However, by requiring up-
to-date BACT as a requirement to use the flexibility, the Texas program is more stringent than 
the federal model.  
Similarly, the Qualified Facility program is comparable to the proposed 
allowables-based minor NSR trigger in EPA’s 2006 proposed Indian Country Rule.  EPA 
proposed the Indian Country rule based on a composite of state minor NSR programs, in order to 
create a level playing field with the states.  “[W]e seek to establish a flexible preconstruction 
permitting program for minor stationary sources in Indian [C]ountry that is comparable to that 
which applies outside of Indian [C]ountry . . . .”30  As such, the rule represents a clear indication 
of the scope of statutory flexibility in crafting minor NSR tools.  “[T]his proposal . . .  represents

how we would implement the program in Indian [C]ountry in the absence of an EPA-approved 
implementation plan.  However, if a tribe is developing its own program, this can serve as one 
example of a program that meets the objectives and requirements of the Act.”31
EPA set an allowables trigger for minor NSR in its Indian Country rule.  Under 
EPA’s rule, “a modification is defined . . . as any physical or operational change at a stationary 
source that would cause an increase in the allowable emissions of the affected emissions unit.”32  
In justifying the allowables-based minor NSR trigger in this rule, EPA distinguished the 
definition of “modification” under minor NSR from that used for major NSR:  
In a recent decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that, based 
on the wording of the definition of “modification” in section 111(a)(4) of 
the Act, the applicability of major NSR to modifications must be based on 
changes in actual emissions (State of New York, et., v. U.S. EPA, June 24, 
2005).  However, because the statutory basis for the minor NSR program 
is section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act, which does not define or refer to a 
definition of “modification,” we believe that we have discretion in 
defining the term as we think best for the minor NSR program in Indian 
Country . . . .33   
In the same fashion, Texas’s Qualified Facility program uses allowables as its minor NSR 
“modification” trigger.  Again, however, the Texas program is more stringent, as it only extends 
the flexibility to well-controlled facilities.

TIP Comments on EPA’s Specific Asserted Deficiencies for the Qualified Facility 
Program
EPA’s concerns on specific aspects of the Texas Qualified Facilities program and 
air permitting definitions are reproduced and addressed below.  Headings are for convenience 
only—all comments are intended to address all aspects of EPA’s proposal.
A.
The Definition of Facility
EPA Comment:

“It is our understanding of State law, that a ‘facility’ can be an 
“emissions unit,” i.e., any part of a stationary source that emits or 
may have the potential to emit any air contaminant.  A ‘facility’ 
also can be a piece of equipment, which is smaller than an 
‘emissions unit.’  A ‘facility’ can be a ‘major stationary source’ as 
defined by Federal law.  A ‘facility’ under State law can be more 
than one ‘major stationary source.’”

TIP Response:
For purposes of the Qualified Facility program, TCEQ regulations make clear that 
“facility” is comparable to the federal definition of an “emissions unit.”  Section 116.10(6)  
defines a facility as: 
A discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure 
that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.  A mine, quarry, well test, or road 
is not a facility.34
Section 116.10 clearly states that the definitions contained in the section apply to all provisions 
contained in the Chapter.35  Thus, the facility definition of §116.10(10)(6) expressly applies to 
Qualified Facility rules contained in Chapter 116.  
This definition is similar to the definition of “emission unit” in Texas’s Title V 
rules.  There, “emissions unit” is defined as:
A discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure 
that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.36
Under the express terms of § 116.10, the definition of “facility” is clear, and 
applies directly to the Qualified Facility rules.
B.
Major NSR Safeguards
1.
The program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR, thereby 
allowing new major stationary sources to construct without a 
Major NSR permit.
EPA Comments:

“Both the SIP-codified Chapter 106, Subchapter A for Permits by 
Rule and the SIP-codified Chapter 116, Subchapter F for Standard 
Permits, contain clear regulatory applicability requirements 
limiting their use to Minor NSR, clear regulatory requirements 
prohibiting their use for any project that constitutes a major 
modification subject to Major NSR, and clear regulatory 
provisions prohibiting the use of these Minor NSR permits from 
circumventing Major NSR. There are no similar regulatory 
applicability requirements, regulatory provisions prohibiting the 
use for Major NSR, and no regulatory provisions prohibiting

circumvention of Major NSR, in the submitted Qualified Facilities 
State Program’s rules and definitions.”
TIP Response:
As outlined above, the Qualified Facility program establishes an allowables-based 
trigger for minor NSR.  The Qualified Facility program has no effect on a permit holder’s 
compliance obligations under the federal PSD or NNSR programs.  
The CAA does not mandate a methodology for determining minor NSR 
applicability.

do not mandate a methodology for determining minor NSR applicability.

In 2000, the U.S. EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) confirmed that 
there is no “legally prescribed methodology” for the emissions test used for minor 
NSR applicability determinations, and rejected the argument made by EPA 
enforcement personnel that, in the absence of an explicit minor NSR methodology 
in State rules, the minor NSR applicability test must be consistent with that used 
for federal PSD purposes.37  

EPA’s own August 2006 proposal for minor NSR programs in Indian Country 
employs an “allowable-to-allowable” test to determine if a modification subject to 
minor NSR requirements has occurred.38
States have great flexibility under the CAA in determining the applicability of 
minor NSR requirements, and that flexibility includes the authority to use allowable emission 
rates in establishing whether minor NSR is triggered.  
TCEQ rules articulate an overriding obligation to comply with federal NSR 
requirements.  Section 116.117(a)(4) requires that an owner or operator wishing to use the 
Qualified Facility program to make a change must document 
[S]ufficient information as necessary to show that the project will comply 
with §116.150 and §116.151 of this title (relating to Nonattainment 
Review) and §§ 116.160-116.163 of this title (relating to Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration Review) . . .39

increase in the allowable emissions of the affected emissions units for any regulated NSR pollutant or that would 
cause the emission of any regulated NSR pollutant not previously emitted.”).

Additionally, §116.117(d) states that “[n]othing in this section shall limit the applicability of any 
federal requirements.”40  The current Qualified Facility rules, therefore, constrain the regulated 
community from making major changes without complying with major NSR requirements.

determination

made 
whether 
the

or 
modification is subject to Major NSR.
EPA Comment:

“We do not find any provisions in the submitted Program that 
require a Major NSR applicability determination for changes. The 
submitted Program’s rules and definitions are not clear on their 
face that first one must determine the threshold question of 
whether the change is a major stationary source or a major 
modification subject to Major NSR.”
TIP Response:
TIP reiterates its comments from Section III.B.1 above.  The overriding obligation 
to comply with federal NSR requirements is made explicit in TCEQ’s rules.  The current 
regulations constrain the regulated community from making major changes without complying 
with major NSR requirements.  The clear provisions in the Texas rules safeguarding federal NSR 
are supported by well-developed TCEQ guidance.41  Neither EPA’s Indian Country rule, nor any 
of several recently SIP-approved state minor NSR rules, contain explicit language calling for a 
major NSR applicability determination before use of the minor NSR tools.42  Accordingly, there 
are no federal requirements, nor any federally-approved analogues, for the provisions that EPA is 
now suggesting should exist.  To the contrary, EPA’s own Indian Country preamble, quoted 
above, notes the absence of such benchmarks.  Requiring additional language in Texas would be 
arbitrary, and would contravene the principle articulated by the Fifth Circuit that, 
Although EPA is required to approve SIPs that provide for the timely 
attainment and subsequent maintenance of primary and secondary ambient 
air standards as well as satisfy other CAA general requirements, see 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(a)(3), the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a 
State’s choices of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that 
otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(2).43

The program does not include the requirement to make Major 
NSR applicability determinations based on actual emissions 
and on emissions increases and decreases (netting) that occur 
within a major stationary source.
EPA Comment:

“[T]his submitted Program allows an evaluation using allowable, 
not actual emissions as the baseline to calculate the project’s 
proposed emission increase and for many of the netting emission 
reduction, thereby in many case possibly circumventing the major 
modification applicably requirements under the Major NSR rules, 
rules that are based upon using actual emissions to calculate 
baseline emissions.”
TIP Response:
TIP reiterates its comments from Section III.B.1 above.  The overriding obligation 
to comply with federal NSR requirements is made explicit in TCEQ’s rules.  Moreover, states 
have great flexibility under the CAA in determining the applicability of minor NSR 
requirements, and that flexibility includes the authority to use allowable emission rates in 
establishing whether minor NSR is triggered.  
C.
Minor NSR Approval Issues
1.
The program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR thereby 
allowing major modification to occur without a Major NSR 
permit.
EPA Comment:

 “There are no statutory and/or regulatory provisions that clearly 
prohibit the use of the Program for major modifications. Nor are 
there any statutory and/or regulatory provisions clearly limiting 
the use of the Program to minor modifications.”
TIP Response:
TIP reiterates its comments from Section III.B.1 above.  The overriding obligation 
to comply with federal NSR requirements is made explicit in the statute, TCEQ’s rules, and 
guidance on the program.  The current regulations and guidance, therefore, constrain the 
regulated community from making major changes without complying with major NSR 
requirements.
2.
The program in not an enforceable Minor NSR Permitting 
program.

HOU2:1184196.7
11
EPA Comments:

“The Program is not clear that each Qualified Facility involved in 
the netting transaction must submit a permit application and 
obtain a permit revision reflecting all of the changes made to 
reduce emissions (relied upon in the netting analysis) as well as 
reflecting the change itself that increased emissions.”  

“At a minimum, the State must revise its rules to make it clear that 
a permit application must be submitted by each participating 
Qualified Facility and the changes made by the participating 
Qualified Facilities are reflected in revised permits issued by the 
TCEQ.”
TIP Response:
As explained above, the Qualified Facility program is a minor NSR triggering 
provision.  Instead of a permit review, a facility must give TCEQ notification of any changes 
made using the program rules and must document the changes and retain that documentation at 
the plant site.
TCEQ guidance makes clear that the facilities involved in a change must be 
qualified facilities at the time the change is to occur.  Any facility that is not a qualified facility at 
the time of the change cannot be involved in the netting analyses.44
In two situations, a facility must qualify with TCEQ prior to making a change, but 
this is not a permitting procedure.  Rather a facility must be qualified by TCEQ when:
(1) The facility is qualified on the basis of BACT, but the specific control method 
has not yet been approved by TCEQ as qualifying BACT, or 
(2) The facility does not have established allowable emissions for an air 
contaminant relevant to the change in a MAERT or Form PI-E document.45
In these two scenarios, an owner or operator must submit a Form PI-E to TCEQ justifying the 
BACT or the determination of allowable emissions for the air contaminants relevant to the 
change.  TCEQ then has 45 days to review the request and either accept it or object.
Additionally, an owner or operator making a change under the program must 
notify TCEQ, either prior to or after the change.  Post change notification must come either 30 
days after the change, or in an annual report.  Pre-change notification is required when, in order 
to achieve a result of no net increase in allowable emissions, the owner or operator makes an 
intra-plant trade above set limits, depending on the location of the facility from the plant’s

boundaries.  An intra-plant trade is when an emission reductions is made at another qualified 
facility at the plant and is traded to the facility where the change is being made.46  
Two important aspects of the program are implicit in the pre-change notification 
requirement.  First, the rule only contemplates intra-plant trading.  Trading among different 
plants held by a common owner is not authorized under the program.  Second, TCEQ must be 
notified of intra-plant trading when the amounts traded are above a set limit.  
If a change implicates a permit special condition, the permit holder must revise its 
permit special condition using the procedures specified in Chapter 116, New Source Review.47  
3.
The program lacks safeguards to ensure that the changes will 
not violate a Texas control strategy and would not interfere 
with attainment and maintenance of NAAQs.
EPA Comments:

“The submitted Program’s netting is not based upon all 
contemporaneous increases at the same major stationary 
source and not all decreases at the same major stationary 
source. We propose, however, to find that such an approach 
satisfies the minimum requirements for an approvable Minor 
NSR netting program as long as the ambient air is protected in 
the trading.”

“The reductions in the Program’s netting are based upon the 
most stringent of the permitted emissions rate (which includes 
the highest achievable actual emission rate) or any applicable 
state or federal rule. Therefore, this Program’s netting is not 
based totally on changes in actual emissions. We are proposing 
to find that this still is acceptable as a Minor NSR netting 
program as long as the ambient air is protected in the 
trading.”
TIP Response:
Qualified Facility flexibility is only available where the change will not result in a 
net increase above existing BACT-reviewed levels at well controlled facilities.  The program 
contemplates changes under existing limits that were set to protect the NAAQS and other air 
quality standards.
The existing Qualified Facility rules contain adequate safeguards that ensure that 
air quality, including NAAQS, are protected when changes are made under the program.

13
Additionally, under the existing rules, changes are sufficiently documented and quantified so that 
a decrease at a facility will only be used in one netting analysis.
Section 116.117 governs the documentation and notification of changes made to 
qualified facility.  That provision specifies that a facility making a change under the program 
must document the change.  This documentation must include:
(1) [Q]uantification of all emissions increases and decreases associated 
with the physical or operation change;
(2) [A] description of the physical or operation change;
(3) [A] description of any equipment being installed;
(4) [S]ufficient information as necessary to show that the project will 
comply with § 116.150 of this title (relating to Nonattainment Review) 
and §§ 116.160-116.163 of this title (relating to Prevention of Significant 
Deterioration Review) and with Subchapter C of this chapter (relating to 
Hazardous Air Pollutants: Regulations Governing Constructed Major 
Sources (FCAA, § 112(g), 40 CFR Part 63)).48
Section 116.117 goes on to require that a facility notify TCEQ of the changes made under the 
program.49  
The intersection of the requirements to document and to report the change to 
TCEQ means that a change may only be used in one netting analysis.  Additionally, the 
requirement that a source document compliance with NNSR and PSD review safeguards 
NAAQS.
4.
The program fails to demonstrate that, if viewed as an 
exception to the Texas Minor NSR permitting rules, it will not 
interfere with any applicable requirement of the Act.
EPA Comment:

“The submitted Program could be considered an exemption 
from Minor NSR.  To be approvable as an exemption from the 
Texas Minor NSR SIP, the State must demonstrate that this 
exemption will not permit changes that will violate the Texas 
control strategies or interfere with NAAQS attainment.”

The Qualified Facility program is correctly analyzed as a minor NSR applicability 
trigger.  As such, it could be viewed as an exemption to the Texas Minor NSR permitting review 
requirements.  The existing rules, however, sufficiently prevent changes that will violate the 
Texas control strategies or interfere with NAAQS attainment.
Qualified Facility flexibility is only available where the change will not result in a 
net increase above existing BACT-reviewed levels at well controlled facilities.  The program 
contemplates changes under existing limits that were set to protect the NAAQS and other air 
quality standards.
Further, as explained in Section III.B.3 above, § 116.117 requires that a 
modification under the program must be documented and an owner or operator specifically must 
show compliance with NNSR and PSD requirements.50  The state NNSR and PSD rules exist to 
promote NAAQS attainment.  The Qualified Facility provisions, therefore, incorporate Texas’s 
control strategies, thus safeguarding the NAAQS.
IV.
Substance of Asserted Deficiencies for Definitions
A.
The removal of the incorporation by reference of the federal PSD definition 
of BACT.
EPA Comments:

“The 2006 submittal also removed from the State rules, the 
PSD SIP requirement at 40 CFR 52.21(r)(4). . . [This revision 
provides that] if a project becomes a major stationary source 
or major modification solely because of a relaxation of an 
enforceable limitation on the source or modification’s capacity 
to emit a pollutant, then the source or modification is subject to 
PSD applies as if construction had not yet commenced.”

“As the mechanism in Texas for ensuring that permits contain 
such a requirement, the State PSD SIP must both require 
BACT and apply the federal definition of BACT (or one that is 
more stringent) to be approved pursuant to part C and Section 
110(l) of the Act.”
TIP Response:
Texas submitted a revision to 30 TAC 116.160(a) and a new section 116.160(c)(1) 
and (2) on February 1, 2006, as a SIP revision to the Texas PSD SIP.  This SIP revision 
reorganized the earlier SIP-approved rules.
                                               
50 30 TAC §116.117(a).

HOU2:1184196.7
15
Prior to the currently-reviewed revisions, Texas had incorporated by reference 
certain provisions of 40 CFR 52.21.  The current SIP-approved rule was adopted by the State on 
October 10, 2001, and EPA approved this recodified SIP rule citation on July 22, 2004.51    
Since 1972, Texas has correctly imposed a control technology review on 
applications for an air quality permit.52  Section 382.0518(b)(1) of the Texas Clean Air Act 
(“TCAA”)  requires that “the proposed facility for which a permit, permit amendment, or a 
special permit is sought will use at least the best available control technology, considering the 
technical practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions 
from the facility.”53  This requirement is echoed in Section 116.111(a)(2)(C) of TCEQ’s rules, 
which requires that “the proposed facility utilize BACT, with consideration given to the technical 
practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions from the 
facility.” 54
The term BACT has been defined by TCEQ in strict accordance with the statutory 
BACT requirement in the TCAA.  Specifically, 30 TAC § 116.10(3) defines BACT as “BACT 
with consideration given to the technical practicability and the economic reasonableness of 
reducing or eliminating emissions from the facility.”  The TCEQ has stated that this definition 
shall apply to all use of the term “BACT” in Chapter 116 of its rules, unless the context clearly 
indicates otherwise.55    
The Texas regulations have continuously carved out 40 CFR 52.21(j), concerning 
control technology review, which is the federal BACT requirement, from the Texas PSD 
regulations.  This is true from 1992 when EPA first granted authority to Texas to administer PSD 
permitting.  As part of the 1992 approval, EPA explained why the federal control technology 
review requirement of Section 52.21(j) could be properly excluded by Texas under the federal 
Clean Air Act.  EPA explained:
This provision of the Federal PSD regulations has been excluded 
from the TACB Regulation VI because the TACB claims that the 
Texas Clean Air Act and the existing State regulations have 
provisions for application of BACT as stringent as the Federal 
requirements in reviewing the permit applications.  The EPA 
review of the Texas Clean Air Act and Regulation VI (Sections 
116.3(a)(3) through 116.3(a)(5)) have indeed revealed that existing 
TACB permit requirements meet the provisions of the Federal PSD 
regulations . . . .56

16
EPA then stated in the final rule approving the Texas PSD program that the federal control 
technology review requirement, which requires BACT for PSD applications, was “not necessary 
for approval of the Texas Program.”57
The preamble to the 2006 revisions to §116.160 in which the incorporations by 
reference of 40 CFR 52.21 were changed, demonstrate a consistency with the approach taken by 
the State in the preceding years.  The preamble explains the incorporation by reference of certain 
sections of 40 CFR 52.21 and further states, “[o]ther definitions used for the PSD program or 
visibility in Class I areas program are currently in [TCEQ’s] rules.”58  
The appropriate BACT definition exists in Texas’s rules, as demonstrated by 
EPA’s past approval of those rules.  All permits Texas has issued under the existing permitting 
program reflect the current TCEQ SIP-approved approach to BACT, and are valid and 
enforceable.
B.
The definition of “insignificant increases” as not requiring a permit does not 
meet EPA’s NSR SIP requirements.
EPA Comments:

“The TCAA seems to be clear that a Permit by Rule, Standard 
Permit, or an Exemption by Rule cannot be used for a major 
source or major modification.  EPA is aware that in the past 
the State has reasonably interpreted an applied the SIP term 
‘insignificant’ for allowing only minor modifications and 
minor sources.  There is information; however, e.g., the State’s 
adoption of a Permit by Rule for Startup, Shutdown, and 
Maintenance Emissions that belies the EPA being able to rely 
upon such a submittal of the relevant statutory provisions. This 
type of Permit by Rule cannot be construed to apply only to 
minor modifications and construction of minor sources. A 
submittal by the State of the applicable statutory sections for 
EPA to approve as part of the Texas SIP no longer seems 
sufficient in view of the issuance of this particular Permit by 
Rule.”

“With the State’s issuance of the Startup, Shutdown, and 
Maintenance Permit by Rule that is not clearly limited to minor 
modifications and the continued expressions by the public, 
regulated entities, and government entities on the lack of 
clarity in the submittals’ language of (A) and (B), EPA is 
proposing to disapprove the submittals for 30 TAC 
116.10(11)(A) and (B) because they are vague and 
unenforceable.”

HOU2:1184196.7
17
TIP Response:
EPA’s concerns that Texas’s adoption of a Permit by Rule (“PBR”) for 
Maintenance Start-up and Shutdown (“MSS”) prevents it from approving the definition of 
modification of an existing facility as excluding “insignificant increase” are unfounded.  TCEQ 
proposed that rule in December of 2005.59  TCEQ, however, never actually adopted the rule.  
Consequently, it was withdrawn in July of 2006.60  EPA’s ability to rely on the state submittal of 
the applicable statutory sections, therefore, should not be undermined by a rule that was never 
adopted.
Additionally, the definition specifying that a modification of an existing facility 
does not include (1) an insignificant increase of an air contaminant that is authorized by one or 
more commission exemptions, or (2) an insignificant increase at a permitted facility61 is not 
vague.  As EPA recognizes, the Texas Clean Air Act clearly prevents an exemption from being 
used for a major source or major modification.62  Consequently, the definition is limited to minor 
modifications.
V.
Conclusion
TIP strongly supports full approval of existing Texas Qualified Facility provisions 
and the existing definitions.  The Texas permitting program, including the definitions and 
Qualified Facility program provisions, is stringent, comprehensive and protective of both the 
environment and public health.  The Texas SIP revisions, including Qualified Facility provisions 
and defined terms, further the attainment of NAAQS, and so should be fully approved.

FLEXIBLE PERMIT PROGRAM RULES
Docket ID No. EPA-R06-OAR-2005-TX-0032
74 Fed. Reg. 48,480 (Sept. 23, 2009)
The Texas Industry Project (“TIP”) submits the following comments in response
to the proposed disapproval of Texas's state implementation plan (“SIP”) submittals relating to 
flexible permits for air quality permitting issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(“EPA”) and published in the Federal Register on September 23, 2009.  TIP is comprised of 62 
companies in the chemical, refining, oil and gas, electronics, forest products, terminal, electric 
utility, and transportation industries with operations in Texas.1  
I.
Introduction
TIP strongly supports full approval of the flexible permit provisions.  The Texas 
air quality permitting program, including the flexible permit provisions, is stringent, 
comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.  
Under Texas’s integrated air permitting regime, air quality in the state is 
demonstrating strong, sustained improvement.  Between 1999 and 2005, NOX emissions in the 
Houston-Galveston area decreased from almost 1,200 tons per day, to under 600 tons per day.2  
Ozone as measured under the one-hour standard in the Houston-Galveston area has declined 
from 220 parts per billion (“ppb”) in 1991 to 127 ppb in 2009.3  Under the eight-hour standard, 
ozone in the Houston-Galveston area has declined from 119 ppb in 1991, to 84 ppb in 2009.4

There has been a similar improvement in toxic air emissions.  Between 2003 and 2008, there has 
been a 50% decrease in highly reactive volatile organic compounds (“HRVOCs”) in the Houston 
area.5  Similarly, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, ozone as measured under the one-hour standard 
declined from 140 ppb in 1991 to 115 ppb in 2009.6  Ozone for the Dallas-Fort Worth area under 
the eight-hour standard has declined from 105 ppb in 1991 to 86 ppb in 2009.7  Moreover, 
between 1988 and 2008, there has been an 80% reduction in VOC compound indicators in the 
Houston area.8  Notably, according to recent TCEQ review, all areas of Texas are in attainment 
for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.9
Further, the data show that stationary sources have contributed more substantial 
emissions reductions than any other category during the period of most dramatic air quality 
improvements.  In the Houston-Galveston area between 1993 and 2008, NOX emissions from 
stationary sources declined from 695 tons per day (“tpd”), to 156 tpd, a decrease of 539 tpd.10  
During that same period, emissions from on-road source declined from 416 tpd to 175 tpd, a 
decrease of 241 tpd.11  Similarly, stationary sources made significant decreases for VOC.  
Between 1993 and 2009 in the Houston-Galveston area, VOC emissions from stationary sources 
decreased from 411 tpd, to 170 tpd, a decrease of 241 tpd.12  On-road sources from that same 
period decreased from 199 tpd, to 86 tpd, a decrease of 113 tpd.13  As the figures indicate, 
stationary sources in Texas have made the most significant strides in reducing emissions.
The submitted revisions strengthen a previously SIP-approved Texas program. 
Under the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “Act”), SIP revisions are approved when those 
revisions do not interfere with the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(“NAAQS”).  States have the primary responsibility for developing plans for the attainment and 
maintenance of the NAAQS.  In fact, as the Fifth Circuit recently explained:
Although EPA is required to approve SIPs that provide for the timely 
attainment and subsequent maintenance of primary and secondary ambient 
air standards as well as satisfy other CAA general requirements, see 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(a)(3), the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a

State’s choices of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that 
otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(2).14
Rather, the proper test for determining whether a SIP revision can be approved is whether the 
revision interferes with attainment of the NAAQS (i.e. that the plan does not make air quality 
worse).15  Far from   “worse” air quality, the last ten years have seen an unprecedented 
improvement in Texas air quality.  The submitted revisions have been fully integrated 
components of the Texas air quality permitting program for all that time.  Because the current 
SIP submittals function to strengthen the existing SIP, such submittal does not raise interference 
concerns, and should be fully approved.
II.
Flexibility in Federal Permitting Rules
A.
Title V Operating Permits
For twenty years, federal air permitting regulations have consistently recognized 
the importance of providing operational flexibility to the regulated community.  In 1990, 
Congress added Title V to the Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “the Act”).  The Act specifies what 
EPA must require of states’ federal operating permit programs.  Specifically, state Title V 
programs must contain: 
Provisions to allow changes within a permitted facility . . . without 
requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any 
provision of title I and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable 
under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in 
terms of total emissions).16
Thus, Congress specifically envisioned emission cap permits in structuring the Title V program.
Two years later, in 1992, EPA promulgated its rules for Title V permit programs 
in 40 C.F.R. Part 70.  In order to provide operational flexibility, EPA promulgated section 
70.4(b)(12), which requires that states put in place Title V programs that allow three specific 
avenues for operational flexibility, including permits that establish federally-enforceable 
emission caps in their Title V programs.  Specifically:
The program shall require the permitting authority, if a permit applicant 
requests it, to issue permits that contain terms and conditions, . . . allowing 
for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted 
facility solely for the purpose of complying with a federally-enforceable 
emissions cap that is established in the permit independent of otherwise 
applicable requirements. 17

EPA emphasized the importance of enabling plant sites to maintain operational 
flexibility in the preamble to Part 70.  There, EPA stated:
[I]t is possible to use the combination of several provisions in these 
regulations 
to 
allow 
for 
operational 
flexibility 
around 
federally-enforceable emission limits or caps which are more strict than 
otherwise required by the Act's applicable requirements.  A source may 
request that the 
permit 
provide 
for 
emissions 
trading 
under 
§ 70.4(b)(12)(iii), as discussed above.  For example, a source could 
structure its permit so that the emissions caps at the permitted facility 
created a pool of unused emissions under the voluntary limit on the 
source's potential to emit. 18
At least 24 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the language of 
Section 70.4(b)(12) into their Title V permit programs.19  Several of these states embraced the 
concept of “federally enforceable emission caps” that authorize emissions, not only as a title V 
revision trigger, but also as an authorization tool under NSR.20  Thus, emission cap permits have 
deep roots outside Texas. 
B.
Flexible Permit Pilot Study
EPA again focused on the importance of operational flexibility when it conducted 
its decade-long Flexible Permit pilot study.  EPA reviewed flexible emission cap permits in six 
states, and found that flexible permits worked well and could be used to further both 
environmental protection and administrative flexibility.21  Behind the project was a recognition 
by both the states involved and EPA that “in today’s increasingly competitive global markets,” 
companies are required “to respond rapidly to market signals and demand, while delivering 
products faster, at lower cost, and of equal or better quality than their competitors.”22  EPA 
recognized that flexible permits could reduce the administrative “friction” of time, costs, delay, 
uncertainty, and risk associated with certain types of operational changes.23

C.
Plantwide Applicability Limits
EPA recognized the advantages of emissions cap permits in promulgating its NSR 
reform in 1996 and 2002.  In introducing the plantwide applicability limit (“PAL”) concept in 
1996, EPA noted:
Rather than face complicated, piecemeal applicability decisions every 
time a change at a plant is contemplated, plant managers may prefer to 
work within an emissions cap or emissions budget, an annual emissions 
limit that allows managers to make almost any change anytime as long as 
the plant’s emissions do not exceed the cap.24
When promulgating its final NSR reform rule in 2002, EPA reiterated the benefits of emission 
caps, reflecting on its experience with the flexible permit pilot project.  EPA stated:
Overall, we found that significant environmental benefits occurred for 
each of the permits reviewed.  In particular, the six flexible permits 
established emissions cap-based frameworks that encouraged emissions 
reductions and pollution prevention, even though such environmental 
improvements were not an explicit requirement of the permits.  We found 
that in a cap-based program, sources strive to create enough headroom for 
future expansions by voluntarily controlling emissions. For instance, one 
company lowered its actual VOC emissions over threefold in becoming a 
synthetic minor  source (that is, 190 tpy to 56 tpy).  Other companies 
lowered their actual VOC emissions by as much as 3600 tpy by increasing 
capture, by using voluntary pollution prevention and other voluntary 
emissions control measures, and by reducing production rates.25  
D.
EPA’s Proposed Indian Country Rule
In 2006, EPA proposed an air permitting rule for Indian Country.  In the preamble 
to that proposed rule, EPA once again expressed the importance of flexibility in air permitting 
programs.  EPA intended the rule to be a representative template of state NSR programs that 
serve to provide operational flexibility while leveling the regulatory playing field:
[W]e seek to establish a flexible preconstruction permitting program for 
minor stationary sources in Indian country that is comparable to that 
which applies outside of Indian country, in order to create a more level 
regulatory playing field . . . .  [T]his can serve as one example of a 
program that meets the objectives and requirements of the Act.26

Moreover, the proposed rule for Indian Country contains a permit structure that embraces the 
emissions cap principle in the form of minor and major PALs. 27
E.
EPA’s Flexible Air Permit Rule
Most recently, in October of 2009, EPA promulgated the federal Flexible Air 
Permitting (“FAP”) Rule.  Through this rulemaking, EPA incorporated changes into Title V 
rules that were “intended to clarify and reaffirm opportunities for accessing operational 
flexibility under existing regulations.”28  
In the preamble to the rule, EPA supported flexibility in air permitting.  “[W]e . . . 
intend to support states and sources who wish to explore the flexibilities available under the 
existing major NSR regulations.”29  Additionally, EPA recognized that state permitting 
authorities have discretion to preapprove minor NSR changes.  “As a general matter, the 
permitting authorities have authority to decide, on a case-by-case basis, the merits of granting an 
advance approval of minor NSR to a particular requesting source.”30  The final rule does not call 
for state Title V or NSR program revisions, but reaffirms pre-existing authority for states to craft 
three forms of flexible air permits.  “The purpose of this rulemaking is to clarify and reaffirm 
opportunities within the existing regulatory framework to encourage the wider use of the FAP 
approaches.”31
III.
Overview of Texas Flexible Permit Program
The TCEQ's flexible permit regulations in 30 TAC Chapter 116, Subchapter G 
were promulgated in 1994 as a flexible mechanism to comply with State minor NSR permitting 
requirements.  This program was established as a way to encourage facilities to install controls 
that would not otherwise be required in exchange for operational flexibility associated with 
emission caps.  Under the flexible permit program, a permittee can seek pollutant-specific caps 
that cover certain facilities at the site.  These caps are established based on the application of 
BACT to all of the facilities contributing to the emissions cap.32  In exchange for this greater 
level of control, sites are provided with an alternative to individual facility emission limits (for 
the covered facilities) as long as the site complies with the emission limits set by the cap.  
The flexible permit also calls for the use of individual emission limitations in 
certain situations.33  Individual limits are used when it is necessary to control off-property 
impacts, such as impacts from air toxics, or to meet the NAAQS.  Specific emission limits that 
an individual facility cannot exceed may also be established to ensure that federal permitting 
requirements are not circumvented.34

The flexible permit program has been quite successful in achieving emission 
reductions.  For example, flexible permitting has resulted in a reduction of more than 25,000 tons 
tpy of SO2 and more than 10,000 tpy of NOx at a coal and petroleum coke fired power plant and 
a reduction of more than 4,800 tpy of SO2 and CO from a petroleum refinery.  
Issuance of a flexible permit has no impact on the permit holder's obligation to 
comply with federal PSD or nonattainment NSR (“NNSR”) requirements.  In fact, for projects 
that constitute major sources or modifications, TCEQ issues a major source permit (PSD or 
NNSR) in addition to the state flexible permit.  
IV.
Substance of Asserted Deficiencies
EPA’s concerns on specific aspects of the Texas flexible permit program are 
reproduced and addressed below.  Headings are for convenience only—all comments are 
intended to address all aspects of EPA’s proposal.
A.
Major NSR Safeguards
1.
The Texas definition of “modification” is not clearly at least as 
stringent as the definition of “modification” in EPA’s Major 
NSR SIP rules.
EPA Comment:

“In evaluating Major NSR SIP revision submittals impacting 
‘‘major modifications,’’ that differ from EPA’s, our review is 
primarily guided by section 111(a)(4) of the Act that describes 
when a ‘‘source’’ is to be considered modified: ‘‘The term 
‘modification’ means any physical change in, or change in the 
method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the 
amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which 
results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.’’  
Texas did not submit any demonstration showing how its use of the 
definition ‘‘modification’’ was at least as stringent as the 
definition of ‘‘modification’’ in EPA’s Major NSR SIP rules.  In 
conducting our review, we particularly were mindful of the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
regarding the scope and requirements of Section 111(a)(4) for 
determining whether a change is a ‘‘major modification.’’ See e.g., 
New York v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (‘‘New York I’’) 
(evaluating EPA’s 2002 revised major NSR rules and interpreting 
Section 111(a)(4)).”

HOU02:1183339.12

TIP Response:
TCEQ rules provide two separate “modification” definitions.  Briefly, a “major 
modification” is a project action that triggers federal NSR review (PSD or Nonattainment).35  In 
contrast the TCEQ’s minor source program uses the definition of “modification of an existing 
facility” to determine if a proposed change triggers minor NSR review, and the scope of the 
change is not limited to pollutants that are federally regulated.36  TCEQ has explicitly stated that 
the flexible permit rules and the definition of “modification of an existing facility” do not act as 
a shield for federal NSR permitting.37  
Moreover, EPA itself distinguished the definition of “modification” under minor 
NSR from that used for major NSR.  In the preamble to its proposed Indian Country rules, EPA 
explained:
In a recent decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that, based 
on the wording of the definition of “modification” in section 111(a)(4) of 
the Act, the applicability of major NSR to modifications must be based on 
changes in actual emissions (State of New York, et., v. U.S. EPA, June 24, 
2005).  However, because the statutory basis for the minor NSR program 
is section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act, which does not define or refer to a 
definition of “modification,” we believe that we have discretion in 
defining the term as we think best for the minor NSR program in Indian 
Country . . . .38
Similarly, Texas has discretion in defining the term for purposes of minor NSR.
Additionally, in 2000, the U.S. EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) 
confirmed that there is no “legally prescribed methodology” for the emissions test used for minor 
NSR applicability determinations, and rejected the argument made by EPA enforcement 
personnel that, in the absence of an explicit minor NSR methodology in State rules, the minor 
NSR applicability test must be consistent with that used for federal PSD purposes.39  
2.
The program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR, thereby 
allowing new major stationary sources to construct without a 
Major NSR permit.
                                               
35 30 TAC § 116.12(18) , defined as “a physical change or change in the method of operation of a major stationary 
source that causes a significant project emissions increase of a federally regulated new source review pollutant, and 
a significant net emissions increase of a federally regulated new source review pollutant which triggers federal 
review, such as PSD or nonattainment review.”
36 30 TAC § 116.10(11), defined as “a physical change or change in the method of operation of a facility which 
causes an increase in the amount of any air contaminant emitted by the facility into the atmosphere or results in an 
emission of any air contaminant not previously emitted.”

EPA Comments:

“[U]nlike the minor NSR SIP rules for Standard Permits in 30 
TAC 116.610(b) and Permits by Rule in 30 TAC 106.4(a)(3) 
and(4), the submitted rules do not require that construction of a 
major stationary source or a major modification, as defined in the 
Major NSR SIP regulations, must meet the Major NSR permitting 
requirements.”

“If Texas truly intends for the submitted Flexible Permits State 
Program to apply only to minor NSR, at a minimum Texas must 
amend Subchapter G to include additional provisions that clearly 
limit its applicability to minor NSR as it did in the Texas minor 
NSR SIP at 30 TAC Chapter 106 for Permits by Rule and 30 TAC 
Chapter 116 Subchapter F for Standard Permits.”
TIP Response:
A flexible permit may be used for major and minor projects under the Texas rules.  
The rules make clear, however, that every project for which a flexible permit is issued must also 
comply with federal NSR requirements.  As explained above, for projects that constitute major 
sources or modifications, TCEQ issues a major source permit (PSD or NNSR) in addition to the 
state flexible permit.  
The flexible permit rules distinguish between flexible permit and federal NSR 
requirements, and make explicit a flexible permit holder's obligation to comply with those 
federal NSR requirements:
●
§ 116.711(1) states that a flexible permit application must demonstrate that ""[t]he 
emissions from the proposed facility, group of facilities, or account . . . will 
comply with all rules and regulations of the commission,"" which includes 
Division 5 (nonattainment NSR) and Division 6 (PSD) of Subchapter B.40
●
§ 116.711(8):  ""Nonattainment review.  If the proposed facility, group of facilities, 
or account is located in a nonattainment area, each facility shall comply with all 
applicable requirements concerning nonattainment review of this chapter.""41
●
§ 116.711(9):  ""Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Review.  If the 
proposed facility, group of facilities, or account is located in an attainment area, 
each facility shall comply with all applicable requirements in this chapter 
concerning PSD review.""42

●
§ 116.718 states that the emissions increase at a facility covered by a flexible 
permit that does not exceed the emission cap is insignificant ""for the purposes of 
state new source review under this subchapter.""  The flexibility provided flexible 
permit holders to make physical or operational changes under the cap is limited to 
minor NSR.43
●
§ 116.720: “Neither operational nor physical changes authorized under this 
subchapter may result in an increase in actual emissions at facilities not covered 
by the flexible permit unless those affected facilities are authorized pursuant to 
§116.110 of this title (relating to Applicability).”  Section 116.110 requires an 
applicability review that can trigger nonattainment NSR or PSD review.
In light of these safeguards, the flexible permit rules constrain the regulated 
community from making major changes without complying with major NSR requirements.   
Regulated entities are subject to clear requirements for the applicability of PSD and NNSR.  Any 
attempts by a permittee to circumvent the federal NSR rules is properly addressed through the 
enforcement process, not by mandating redundant rule language as an approval condition.
3.
The program does not require that first an applicability 
determination 
be 
made 
whether 
the 
construction 
or 
modification is subject to Major NSR.
EPA Comment:

“The submitted Program fails to require that the applicability 
of the Major NSR requirements be evaluated prior to 
considering whether the construction of a new source or 
making a change can be authorized under a Flexible Permit.”
TIP Response:
As outlined above, Texas regulations explicitly require permit holders to comply 
with federal NSR rules.  Additionally, TCEQ rules such as § 116.150, governing New Major 
Source or Major Modification in Ozone Nonattainment Areas, § 116.151, governing New Major 
Source or Major Modification in Nonattainment Area Other than Ozone, and §§ 116.160-163 
governing the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Requirements, make clear that applicants 
for a flexible permit are subject to an applicability demonstration for both Nonattainment review 
and PSD review.  In light of these regulations, the Texas structure contains adequate safeguards 
to ensure that flexible permit applications are subject to federal NSR analyses and comply with 
federal NSR.
4.
The Texas definition of “account” may result in an emission 
cap applying to multiple major stationary sources.
EPA Comments:
                                               
43 Id. § 116.718.

HOU02:1183339.12
11

“Texas SIP defines an “account” to include an entire company 
site, which could include more than one plant and certainly more 
than one major stationary source. . . Accordingly, under a Flexible 
Permit, a single emissions limitation in the emission cap could 
apply to multiple major stationary sources.”

“By allowing an emission cap to be established for an account, 
which can include multiple major stationary sources, the submitted 
SIP revisions may allow a major stationary  source to net a 
significant emissions increase against a decrease occurring 
outside the major stationary source, from facilities on the 
account’s site that are covered under the Flexible Permit.”
TIP Response:
TCEQ rules provide that the definition of “Account” is tied to the definition of 
“Site.”  30 TAC 101.1(1) defines “Account”:  
For those sources required to be permitted under Chapter 122 of this title 
(relating to Federal Operating Permits Program), all sources that are 
aggregated as a site.   For all other sources, any combination of sources 
under common ownership or control and located on one or more 
contiguous properties, or properties contiguous except for intervening 
roads, railroads, rights-of-way, waterways, or similar divisions.44
Therefore, an account for any major stationary source is limited to a specific plant site.  The Title 
V rules, specifically § 122.10(27), provide that a Site is defined as “[t]he total of all stationary 
sources located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under common 
control of the same person . . . .”  The flexible permit rules specify that only one flexible permit 
may be issued at an account site and a flexible permit may not cover sources at more than one 
account site.45  
Moreover, the regulations governing NNSR and PSD are clear that emissions 
increases are evaluated on a project level rather than increases across a site.  For example, 
§116.150 states that the NNSR netting analysis is required unless “the proposed emissions 
increases associated with a project, without regard to decreases, is less than 5 tons per year of 
the individual nonattainment pollutant in areas classified  . . . as Serious or Severe.”46  Similarly, 
§ 116.160 states that “netting is required for all modification to existing major sources of 
federally regulated new source review pollutants, unless the proposed emissions increases 
associated with a project, without regard to decreases, are less than major modification 
thresholds for the pollutant . . . .”47

Reading these rules together shows that they provide sufficient safeguards against 
a major stationary source netting a significant emissions increase against a decrease occurring 
outside a site using a flexible permit.
5.
Lack of a program requirement for ""crosswalks"" from prior 
Minor and Major NSR permit terms.  
EPA Comments:

“The more intricate a plan, the greater the need for detailed 
requirements.”

“[T]he lack of a program requirement for records with 
detailed 
crosswalks 
and 
of 
tracking 
and 
reporting 
requirements, one cannot determine which grandfathered units 
on a site are covered or not by a Flexible Permit, or which pre-
existing minor NSR permitted units are covered or not by a 
Flexible Permit, much less which permit terms, limits, and 
conditions are covered, are not covered, are retained, or not.”
TIP Response:
The flexible permit rules require special conditions and other necessary 
conditions, such as requirements for monitoring, testing, recordkeeping, and reporting.48  When a 
flexible permit incorporates facilities that were previously authorized under an existing PSD 
and/or nonattainment permit, TCEQ identifies the special conditions initially contained in those 
federal permits with the appropriate notation (PSD), (NA), or (PSD and NA) in the conditions.49  
The permit representations are also carried forward into the flexible permit.50
An owner or operator can request to change the conditions contained in every 
Texas permit if the circumstances warrant, the applicable requirements are met, and TCEQ 
approves the change.51  Consequently, the rules contemplate that a permittee may request a 
change in conditions from earlier-issued permits when applying for a flexible permit.52  If such 
changes to representations are proposed, those changes are reviewed, and monitoring and 
recordkeeping requirements, consistent with any proposed changes in representations, are then 
added to the special conditions of the permit.53  
For flexible permits that contain major sources authorized under existing PSD 
and/or nonattainment permits, the PSD and/or nonattainment permits are consolidated into the

B.
Minor NSR Approval Issues
1.
The program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR, thereby 
allowing new major stationary sources to construct without a 
Major NSR permit.
EPA Comment:

“There are no statutory and/or regulatory provisions that 
clearly prohibit the use of the Program for major stationary 
sources and major modifications. Nor are there any statutory 
and/or regulatory provisions clearly limiting the use of the 
Program to minor sources and/or minor modifications. There 
are no provisions that prohibit the use of the Program for 
construction of new major stationary sources and major 
modifications of existing major stationary sources and minor 
sources.”
TIP Response:
TIP reiterates the points made in Section IV.A.1 above.  A flexible permit may be 
used for major and minor projects under the Texas rules.  The rules make clear, however, that 
every project for which a flexible permit is issued must also comply with federal NSR 
requirements.  As explained above, for projects that constitute major sources or modifications, 
TCEQ issues a major source permit (PSD or NNSR) in addition to the state flexible permit.  
Texas’s flexible permit rules explicitly state that sources applying for flexible 
permits are subject to federal NSR.  The rules constrain the regulated community from making 
major modifications without complying with federal NSR requirements.  
2.
The 
program 
lacks 
replicable, 
specific, 
established 
implementation procedures for establishing the emission cap in 
a Minor NSR Flexible Permit.
EPA Comments:

“There are not specific, established, replicable procedures 
providing available means to determine independently, and for 
different scenarios, how the State will calculate a Flexible 
Permit’s cap and/or individual emissions limitations for a 
company’s site, plants on the site, major stationary sources on

14
the site, a facility within a major stationary source on the site, 
facilities on the site, a group of units on the site, for one 
pollutant but not another, etc.”

“Because applicants can choose to establish caps or individual 
emission limitations for just certain pollutants rather than for 
all pollutants emitted from the source(s) included in the 
Flexible Permit, the submitted Program also must contain 
legally enforceable procedures for determining both the cap 
and individual emissions limitations for each relevant pollutant 
for each source and address how sources or pollutants not 
included in the Flexible Permit will be regulated.”
TIP Response:
Under the Texas rules, an emissions cap is calculated using the maximum 
expected activity or operating level of a facility and the current BACT applied to each facility. In 
other words, the emissions cap is the sum of the well-controlled emissions of each facility under 
the cap.55  Emission caps are generally calculated for each specific criteria pollutant and other 
pollutants as necessary or desired by the company obtaining the flexible permit.  The permittee is 
required to meet BACT as applied to all facilities individually contributing to a particular 
emission cap.
The flexible permit also allows for the use of individual emission limitations.56  
Individual emission limits are used when it is necessary to ensure protection of off-property 
impacts, such as control of air toxics, or to meet the NAAQS.  Specific emission limits that an 
individual facility can not exceed may also be established to ensure that federal permitting 
requirements are not circumvented.57
The rules do contain an established and replicable method for determining an 
emissions cap.  Namely, the rules require that each flexible permit involve the summing of 
BACT emission rates.  While BACT determinations may vary between specific types of sources, 
the use of federal and state BACT guidance results in a replicable procedure for establishing 
caps.
Additionally, the rules require that an applicant indentify “each facility” to be 
included in the flexible permit and to identify “each contaminant for which an emission cap is 
desired.”58  
The flexible permits rules do not change the rule governing facilities and 
pollutants not addressed in a plant’s flexible permit.  Facilities not incorporated into a plant’s 
flexible permit remain subject to their existing authorizations.  This applies with equal force to

pollutants not covered by a flexible permit.  If a pollutant is not addressed by a flexible permit, 
the emissions of that pollutant remain subject to existing permit limits.
3.
Lack of a program requirement for ""crosswalks"" from prior 
Minor and Major NSR permit terms and other requirements 
of the Texas SIP.  
EPA Comment:

“We also are proposing to disapprove the submitted Program 
because it would allow holders of a Flexible Permit to make de 
facto amendments of existing SIP permits including changes in 
the terms and conditions (such as throughput, fuel type, hours 
of operation) of minor and major NSR permits, without a 
preconstruction review by Texas.”
TIP Response:
TIP reiterates the points made in Section IV.A.4 above.  
4.
The program lacks the necessary more specialized monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting (MRR) requirements required 
for this type of Minor NSR program.
EPA Comment:

“The submitted Program lacks provisions explicitly addressing 
the type of monitoring requirements that are necessary to 
ensure that all of the movement of emissions between the 
emission points, units, facilities, plants, etc., still meet the cap 
for the pollutant, still meet the individual emissions limitations, 
and still meet any other applicable state or federal 
requirement.”
TIP Response:
The Texas rules’ stringent provisions for monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting require the regulated community to monitor and submit information sufficient to 
safeguard environmental quality.
As explained above, TCEQ issues flexible permits with conditions on 
recordkeeping, monitoring, and reporting.  All flexible permits require recordkeeping that 
contains:
[D]ata sufficient to demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 
caps and individual emission limitations contained in the flexible permit 

HOU02:1183339.12
16
shall be maintained in a file at the plant site and made available at the 
request of personnel from the commission or any air pollution control 
program having jurisdiction. . . .  This information may include, but is not 
limited to, emission cap and individual emission limitation calculations 
based on a 12-month rolling basis and production records and operating 
hours. Additional recordkeeping requirements may be specified in special 
conditions attached to the flexible permit.59
The flexible permit rules contemplate that additional recordkeeping requirements may be tailored 
to the type of source covered by a flexible permit.  In this way, the Texas recordkeeping 
requirements are as stringent, if not more stringent, than federal rules.
TIP believes that a comparison of Texas’s reporting requirements to the reporting 
requirements of the proposed Indian Country minor NSR rules highlight that the Texas 
requirements are as stringent, if not more stringent.  That rule requires:
(i) Annual submittal of reports of monitoring required under paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, including the type and frequency of monitoring, and 
a summary of results obtained by monitoring.
(ii) Prompt reporting of deviations from permit requirements, including 
those attributable to upset conditions as defined in the permit, the probable 
cause of such deviations, and any corrective actions or preventive 
measures taken. Within the permit, the reviewing authority must define 
‘‘prompt’’ in relation to the degree and type of deviation likely to occur 
and the applicable emission limitations.60
Further, with respect to emission events and MSS, Texas requirements go far 
beyond federal benchmarks.  The Texas flexible permit rules require that permit holders comply 
with Sections 101.201 and 101.211, which govern reporting and recordkeeping of emissions 
events and maintenance, startup, and shutdown reporting.61  Section 101.201 requires that the 
owner or operator of a regulated entity experiencing an emissions event “shall create a final 
record of all reportable and non-reportable emissions events as soon as practicable, but no later 
than two weeks after the end of an emissions event.”62  This two-week period is even more 
stringent than the proposed Indian Country provision requiring “prompt” reporting of emissions 
events.  
Section 101.201 of the Texas rules also requires that permit holders retain records 
both for emissions events that are reportable and those that are not reportable.  The provisions for 
non-reportable events contain requirements similar to the proposed Indian Country rule.  Those 
records must be maintained on-site for a minimum of five years and be made readily available 
upon request to commission staff or personnel of any air pollution program with jurisdiction.63   
Additionally, records on non-reportable emissions events are required to include:

(1) the physical location of the points at which emissions to the atmosphere 
occurred;
(2) the date and time of the discovery of the emissions event;  
(3) the estimated duration of the emissions; 
(4) the compound descriptive type of the individually listed compounds or 
mixtures of air contaminants, from all emission points involved in the emissions 
event, that are known through common process knowledge or past engineering 
analysis;
(5) the estimated total quantities and the authorized emissions limits for those 
specified compounds or mixtures;
(6) the preconstruction authorization number or rule citation of the standard 
permit, permit by rule, or rule, if any, governing the facilities involved in the 
emissions event; and the authorized emissions limits, if any, for the facilities 
involved in the emissions events;
(7) the basis used for determining the quantity of air contaminants emitted;
(8) the best known cause of the emissions event at the time of recording; 
(9) the actions taken, or being taken, to correct the emissions event and minimize 
the emissions; and 
(10) any additional information necessary to evaluate the emissions event.64
There is, in addition, a wide array of additional Texas rules specifying MRR 
requirements.  A cross-section of these provisions are summarized below:

§ 101.10 requires permit holders to submit emissions inventories that detail “actual 
emissions of VOC, NOx, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), lead (Pb), 
particulate matter of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), any other contaminant 
subject to NAAQS, emissions of all HAPs identified in FCAA §112(b), or any other 
contaminant requested by the commission from individual emission units within an 
account.”65

§ 115.116 requires recordkeeping for specified storage tanks for VOCs.  Permit 
holders must inspect those tanks and record, among other things, a calculation of 
emissions for all secondary seal gaps that exceed 1/8 inch (0.32 centimeter) where the 
accumulated area of such gaps is greater than 1.0 square inch per foot (21 square 
centimeters per meter) of tank diameter. These calculated emissions inventory 
reportable emissions must be reported in the annual emissions inventory submittal 
required by §101.10 of this title (relating to Emissions Inventory Requirements).66

§ 117.801 requires reporting on stack testing for NOX emissions.  These reports 
include data summarizing emission rates found, reported in the units of the applicable 
emission limits and averaging periods, the maximum rated capacity, normal 
maximum capacity, and actual operating level of the unit during the test (in million 
                                               
64 30 TAC §101.201(b)(2).

British thermal units, horsepower, or megawatts, as applicable), and description of the 
method used to determine such operating level; the operating parameters of any active 
nitrogen oxides (NOX ) control equipment during the test; and documentation that no 
changes to the unit have occurred since the compliance test was conducted that could 
result in a significant change in NOX emissions.67

§ 111.111 requires that flare logs be kept that detail when flares are observed 
including the time of day and whether or not the flare was smoking. “Flare operators 
shall record at least 98% of these required observations.”68
A review of all Texas MRR requirements shows that sources operating under 
flexible permits are subject to a thorough and rigorous MRR regime.
V.
Conclusion
TIP strongly supports full approval of existing Texas flexible permit provisions.  
The Texas permitting program, including the flexible permit provisions, is stringent, 
comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.  Consistent with the 
findings of EPA’s Flexible Permit Pilot Study,69 flexible permits in Texas have contributed to the 
sustained improvement of air quality in Texas.  The Texas SIP revisions, including flexible 
permits, further the attainment of NAAQS, and so should be fully approved.

utilizing TCEQts current illegal policy 
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired 
power 
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating

Federal Clean Air Act standards 
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants - -  
no

all 
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and 
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in 
accordance 
with the Federal Clean Air Act. 
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming 
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow 
existing 
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions. 

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants 
than any 
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on 
the top 
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past 
five 
years. Texans deserve better. We cannot let coal stand in the 
way of 
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules 
in 
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for 
their mess 
and that no permits issued under TCEQ1s illegal permitting

and 
protects our air quality, health and communities.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.  Texans deserve better.  We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.  Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.

The
refusal of our own state administration and agencies to protect our
population from unwarranted and entirely unnecessary pollution of our

for Texas residents.

Contrary to popular nationwide opinion, not everybody in Texas is
pro-coal, pro-oil-and-gas,
and anti-environmental regulation.
However,
the TCEQ appears to be behaving as if that is the case,
and as if Texas
is an independent country.
TCEQ's illegal permitting process flouts
Congress and the EPA,
and disregards the long-term interests of Texas
citizens.
You must put strong rules in place to make sure the coal industry is
held responsible and that no permits issued under TCEQrs illegal
permitting process are allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations
are vital to cleaning up the energy industry and putting us on a path

Dear Mr.
Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
-
Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal-fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean 'Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global-warming
emissions and to make sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to continue polluting with global-warming emissions.
We Texans like to boast about being BIG,
but we donlt want to be BIG
when it comes to carbon emissions and emission increases!
Help us
citizens by forcing the agency that's supposed to assure our air
quality to actually do its job,
not subvert its purpose.
We need help
to push for insulating and putting solar panels on residences we could
create lots of jobs while decreasing the need for coal-fired power
plants.
We need the rules in place that will promote those choices.
Sincerely,
Ms.

Here in Texas it is common knowledge that the TCEQ is a joke whose
purpose is to protect industry over people.  It is time that the EPA
did its job and force the TCEQ to make good on its responsibility to
the citizens of Texas.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.  Texans deserve better.  We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.  Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.

Our state has more

Texans

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming

Help us quickly - we are threatened here in Corpus Christi with a
proposed Petroleum Coke burning power plant that as planned will
increase our air pollution by at least 70 percent!   And put huge
amounts of Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere!  From one source!   We
are not confident that TCEQ will protect us as the plans go forward.

Dear Lisalackson, 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken. I applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ 
air permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be thrown out. 
That was a good first step. Now is the time for the EPA to take bold action by: 
Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ utilizing TCEQ's 
current illegal policy 
Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating 
under the Federal Clean Air Act standards 
Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all per- 
mits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance with the 
Federal Clean Air Act. 
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any other state in the nation, is #I in carbon emissions, and is on the

I want TCEQ to strictly adhere to the Federal Clean Air Act standards;
and I intend to vote, organize and contribute to make this happen.  We
should not be _increasing_ the amount of energy produced by coal -- the
most polluting source of energy.  Granting these new pollution permits
is effectively subsidizing this antiquated form of energy production,
and making it more difficult for alternative cleaner energy sources to
be developed.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal-fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean 'Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global-warming
emissions and to make sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to continue polluting with global-warming emissions.
There are clear correlations between emissions and health,
especially
children's health,
and especially asthma in children. Sit in an
emergency room with a wheezing child and think very carefully about the
meaning of your decisions.
Sincerely,

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any

I live approximately one mile from the proposed site of the Tenaska
Trailblazer Energy Center.  This plant threatens to endanger the lives
of many residents who live in very close proximity, and those living in
the Sweetwater area.
My family and I moved to Texas, and to the country specifically, to
escape pollution, noise and development.  We all know that the TCEQ is
a corrupt organization and that Texas is a filthy state because of
their actions (or non-actions).  Please allow for a moratorium on all
new coal-fired plants within the state until the TCEQ is forced to
abide by Federal regulations and clean up Texas air!

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal-fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean 'Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global-warming
emissions and to make sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to continue polluting with global-warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation,
is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong
rul~s in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
Texas needs to get on board and enforce standards that are the norm in
other states.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Betty Armstrong

AS an individual
I
am doing everything
I
can to reduce my carbon
emissions--from improving the energy performance of my home to changing
my lifestyle to purchasing 100% wind electricity.
Unfortunately there
is only so much an individual can do alone.
Government must do its
part as well and take the action it is obligated to do.
Texas will be
particularly hard hit by the effects of climate change--indeed it
already is--and there is an onus upon regulators to take strong action
now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the damage.
Stopping new coal plant construction and cleaning up or shuttering old
plants is the first step.
There is no time to waste.
You need to act
now.

Comment of the G ulf Coast Ligni te Coalition
Dear Mr. Spruiell:
On behalf of the Gulf Coast Lignite Coalition. we respectfully submit the attached comments on
the September 23. 2009 proposed U.S. Environmental Protecti on Agency (E PA) disappro val of
clements of the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP).
As described fully in the attached
comments, GCLC believes that the proposed disapproval is unwarranted because the Texas SIP.
as implemented by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) meets or exceeds
Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) requirements. Should you have any addi tional que stions, please
do not hesitate to contact me.
Respectfully ubm itted.

COMMENT
OF THE GULF COAST LIGN ITE COALITION
I NTRon UCTlo N
The Gulf Coast Ligni te Coalition (GCLC) is a coal ition of entitie that own or operate lignite and
coal -fired power plant s and
urfa ce mines within the
tares of Texas. Louisiana and Mis issippi.
Coalition membership repre ents a vast majority of the lignite mining and lignite-ti red electrical
generation industry in Texas. Louisiana anel Mississippi.
In Texas alone. these indu stries
represent over
10 billion in annual expend itures and over 33,000 permanent job .
GCLC ack nowledges that, as recognized by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ), some changes to the language in the Texas rules could be made to improve clarity and
transparency.
However, the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP), as implemented by the
TC EQ, meets or
exceeds Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA)
requ irements and
formal SIP
disapp roval is inappropriate.
The EPA should look beyond immaterial differences in the rule
provi ions and focus on the positi ve results that Tex as has been able to achieve under the Tex as
Clean Air Act (TCAA) and the State"" accompanying submittals to alter the Texas SIP. EPA has
a history of focu sing on results, and . as such, we wou ld ask that EPA continue that practice and
not choose to alter co urse duri ng a time when the reg ional and national economy are the most
vulnerable.
As discussed fully below, the Texas SIP, including the programs that the EPA has proposed to
disapprove, have met the goals established in the FCAA by being protective of the public health
and welfare in one of the nation's most productive states.
Texas' power, fuel, chemical and
manu facturing production exceeds that of any other state, and the Texas power industry is the
bedrock for this production capacity. Texas producers arc able to achieve this high level of
output, while still emitting fewer emi ssions per megawatt than the vast majority of states in this
country. The variety of Texas air permitting programs protect the environment and ensure that
Texas meets the letter intent of FCAA, while also preserving economic growth and job creation
for a growing economy and population-this should be encouraged, not restrict ed.
Many Texas permittees have relied on the numerous provisions that fall within the Texas ""SIP
gap""; in some ca es, these provisions have been awa iting EPA action for 15 years prior to the
EPA's recent proposed disapproval. The EPA's Federal Register notices in no way acknow ledge
this burden for which the EPA itself is respo nsible. As a direct result of EPA 's approach, there is
a real potential for increases in compliance costs and uncertainty while the regulated com munity
grapples with business decisions that must be mad e in a new legal en vironment where the
validity of long-standing air authorizations is in question.
The net result of a continuation of
EPA's approach will be restrained, delayed, and possibl y even cancelled business investment
while po wer plants (and other Texas industries) try to predict their compl iance responsibilities.
The EPA's approach in threateni ng to disapprove multiple program s co uld resul t in effect ively
punishing the regulated co mmunity by forcing it to go thro ugh addi tional expen sive and
environmentally unnecessary permitting processes.
This outcome is the resu lt of the EPA 's
apparent focu s on form over substance in this instance-
and several misunderstand ings abo ut the

nature of the Texas air permitting program .
GCLC understands that the EPA must uphold its
obligation to enfo rce the Clean Ai r Act. but GC LC respectfully req uests that the
take a
collaborative , not combative, approach with Texas. This approach will limit the uncertainty that
threatens jobs and the oth erwise healthy economic development of Texa , which provi les
products that play
uch a ke
ro le to the econo mic vitality of our nati on .

I O ~
1.
Texas' Public Participation Program is Robu st and Meets or Exceeds All Federal
Public Pnrticipation Requirements.
GC LC first offers comments on Texas ' public participation program , as the pu blic participation
iss ues are im plicated throug ho ut the three above-refere nced Fede ral Register notices.
GCLC
consid ers these comme nts tim ely and appropriate given EPA 's pream ble statement that directs
the public to read the three pending notices and the November 2008 public part icipation package
""in conjunction"" with each other.
In 1999, the Texas Legisla ture enacted HB 80 I, wh ich created a new cross-media pub lic notice
and participation process for envi ronmenta l permitting in Texas. The elements of thi s program
are robust and
fully compliant with federal req uirem ents. In fact , this process exceeds the
requirements of the fede ral rules in almost every respect.
First, notice of all applications is published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the new project will be located. '
This notice trig gers a 30-day public comme nt period.
During this period. the public may ti le wri tten co mme nts and, depending on the type of perm it
bei ng applied for, request a public meeting or a contested case hearing. However. the public-
even parties not residing in the State-
may make comme nts on an air permit application, and the
TC EQ is obligat ed to respond to these comments.'
Note that EPA's pream ble stateme nt that
on ly affected person s are allowed to com ment and trigge r a response obligation by TCEQ
reflects a fundamental mi sunderstanding of the Texas program.
Based on the level of pub lic
interest, public meetings arc also pro vided for in the Texas rules.
It is important to recognize
that the ""public meeting"" component of the state program is equivalent to the ""public hearing""
component of the federal program .
The Texas program goes we ll beyond the notice and meetin g process con templated by the EPA's
own rules and allows ""affected persons"" to have the right to request a contested case hearing.
The state ""hearing"" component exceed s the federal req uirements by providin g for a trial-type
contested case hearing. If gra nted ""affec ted person"" status, the pro testant will become a party to
an administrative proceeding.
In this proceeding, the permit ap plicant has the burden of proof
for demonstrating tha t its permi t fully comp lies with all aspects of applicable Texas and fede ral
statute . As a party to this proceeding, a protestant has the legal authority to challenge evidenc e
and arguments put forth by the applicant. The proceedi ng is held before an Administrative Law

ues.
gain, by providing lo r this trial-type con tested case hearing process,
the Texas public participation process goes well beyond federal requ ireme nt . which require only
that interested partie ' have the ability to partic ipate in a notice and comment period.
GC LC understand s that the TCEQ is working with the EPA to addres
many of the concerns that
the EPA has advanced, and GCLC supports these effo rts.
However, GCLC believes that. as a
part of these negotiations, the EPA is attempting to impose requiremen ts that go beyond its own
regulations. For instance, the EPA argues that Texas' SIP violates 40 C.F.R. § 51. 161(a) and (b)
because the Texas program in certain situations does not require a second round of notice after
the draft permit has been prepared and the TCEQ has made an initial decision on the application.
However, the Texas program complies with the technical requirem ents of EPA's regulations.
The EPA's rules only prov ide that the ""public information must inclu de the agency's anal ysis of
the effect of construction or modification on ambient air quality, including the agency 's proposed
approval or disapproval."":'
The EPA's regulations do not requi re notice to be issued of this
public informa tion, only that it be made available to the public. Under the Texas program. this
information is made available to the public.
Furthermore, Texas also satisfies the ""minimum
requirements"" set forth at 40 C.F.R. § 51.161(b).
This is the kind of semantic distinction we
hope EPA can move beyond to resolve these issue s immediately.
In sum, the public participation process is robust and effective.
Every state is given the
flexibility under the FCAA to meet the minimum requ irement s of that Act and tailor additional
requirements to fit its needs.
By failing to recognize the sufficiency of the current public
participation process, EPA has triggered some discussions in Texas about whether the Texas
publ ic part icipat ion process should simply mirror the federal system, which would mean the
elimination of the Te xas
contested
case hearing process-an outco me
the environ mental
community has long opposed.
By resolvin g semantic di Iferences and eliminating uncertainty
about the status of the Te xas SIP as soon as possible, EPA will minimize the need for the State of
Texas to have tha t debate.

Texas' Definition of "" Best Ava ilable Contro l Technology"" Is Cons istent With
Federal Re gulation s.""
Tex as' Februarv 1. 2006 submittals revised sections of the Texas PSD SIP remo ving references
to the federal defin ition of BACT as defin ed in 40 C. F.R. 5 1.166(b)( 12).5
TCE~Q staff has
indicated that this was an unintentional removal of the pro vision.
It will be addressed in
rule making that is scheduled for the January 13. 20 I0 TC EQ age nda . Thi s should resolve EPA
concerns regarding the Texas PSD program.
' 40 c.r.«. § 51. 16 1(a).
-l EPA proposed to disapprove a separately referenced definition of BACT in the Qualified Facilities proposed
disapproval. The definition of BACT. although codified here in 30 TAC 116.10 (General Definitions) is virtually
identical to the BACT provisions found in 30 TAC §116.111, as analyzed in this section. This definition. as applied
by the TCEQ, meets all federal requirements for major source BACT determinations.
j See 30 TAC § 116.160(a).

Mr. Stanley £\'1.

The Texas BACT ass essme nt process is legally valid as it has been and con tinu es to be in full
compliance with FCAA requirement s. This is particularly importan t for those entities that were
subject to a BACT analysis and received PSD permi ts under the February 2006 submittal rules
and for those entities who cont inue to be subject to BACT anal ysis.
Texas has a three-tiered
BACT approach that has been previously approved by the EPA. This policy, as demo nstrated in
the TCEQ guidance document ""Evaluating Best Available Cont rol Technology (BACT) in Air
Permit Applications."" outlines BACT policy in the state. Drafted in April 2001. it has been the
primary guidance document for both permittees and protestant
for BACT assessment.
It
predate
the Texas February 2006 submittal
by almost five years and continues to be the
primary guidance document regarding BACT after the submittals; BACT has been con sistently
app lied by the TCEQ before and after the submitted changes to Chapter 11 6 of"" Title 30 of the
T EXAS ADM INISTRATIVE C ODE.
The EPA in the proposed disapproval cites Section 165 of the FCAA, which provides that ""no
major emitting facility . . . may be constru cted [or modi fied] in any area which this part applies
unless-
( I) a permit has been issued for such proposed facility in accorda nce wit h this part
setting forth emission limitations for such facility which conform to the requirements of this
part . . . (4) the proposed fac ility is subject to the best available control technology for each
pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter.""? TCEQ's three-ti er approach to BACT meets
the abo ve requirements, ensuring that facil ities receiving PSD permits in the state conform to the
requirement s of Section 165 of the FCA A and are requ ired to utili ze the Best Available Control
Technology.
Furthermore, EPA has vo iced its support 1'01' Texas three-ti er approach during negotiations with
TCEQ over these issues.
Whi le respondin g to TCEQ submittals, the EPA on October 27, 2008
stated that it ""agreed with many"" of the statements made by TCEQ defending their BACT
program in a June 13. 2008 letter.? TCEQ statements included that, to its understand ing, the
three-tiered approach is an acceptable and approved approach by the EPA
If the EPA did have
concerns with that assessment, the EPA had the opportunity to voice them at that time or since
Texas (and other states) began using this type of three-tiered approach.
In ligh t or the above fact s, GC LC fund amentall y disagrees with EPA 's letter, dated November
12, 2009. response to TC EQ co mments, stated that the EPA does ""not believe that all existing
major NS R permit

eliminate fu rt her uncertainty about the
tatus of the Texas program and the sufficiency of
existing permits and pending BACT reviews.
3.
T he Pollution Contro l Project Standard Permit Is Co n risrent With All Federa l
Regulations and Is Appro priate Under""EPA'
NSR Review Reform Regulations.
The EPA is incorrect in proposing that the Texas submitted Pollution Co ntrol Project (PCP)
Standard Permit (3 0 TAC § 11 6.617) is overly broad 9 and that the elements or case-by-case
additional authorizations, source-specific reviews, and source specific tec hnical determinations
warrant the minor NS R SIP case-by-case permit process under 30 TAC § 116.11O(a)(1).10 The
foundation for EPA' s argume nt is that, according to the proposed disapproval, ""a Standard
Permit is a minor NSR permit limited to a particular narrowly defi ned so urce category for which
the permit is designed to cover and cannot be used to make site-specific determinations that are
outside the scope of this type of permit."" I I
The EPA's basis in narrowly de fining a Standard Permit to one source category is not found in
the FCAA or EPA rul es. TCEQ 's PCP Standa rd Permit meets the req uire ments of the FCAA.
Section 110(a)(2 )(C) is the primary provision of the FCAA governing EPA approval of standards
permits, and states that each SIP shall ""provide for . . . regulation of the modi fication and
construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as necessary to assure
that nati onal ambient air quality standards are ac hieved, incl uding a permit pro gra m as required
in parts C [PSD] and 0 [nonattainment NS R].""
Since standard permits are made unavailable to
authorize new major sources and major modifications subject to Parts C and D, the PCP Standard
Permit does not run afo ul of the FCAA . Furthermore, the PCP Standard Permit satisfies EPA's
requirements for minor NSR programs found at 40 C.F.R. § 5 1.160.
Finally, as an additional
element above and beyond federal requirements, the Executive Director of the TCEQ maintains
an abi lity 10 prevent the perm it from being ap~roved if the ED determines there are health effects
concerns or the potential to exceed NAAQS .L
GCLC urges EPA to affirm the sufficiency of the
TC EQ PCP Sta ndard Permi t process to eliminate furthe r uncertainty about the status of the Texas
program and the sufficiency of existing or pending Standard Permits.

Texas' Flexible Pennitting Program, as Ad ministered, Is Co nsistent With Fede ra l
Permitting Requirem ents, and th e Texas SIP Requires Only M ino r Clarifying
Amendments.
Th
EP
's Federal Register notices and correspondence with the TCEQ ignore the fact that the
Texas Flexible Permitting Program has had a significant impact in improving air quality in
Texas .
The program, initially implemented in 1994, was success ful in bringing many major
sources out of grandfathered status and into the Tex as permitting program.
Since that time. the
Flexible Permitting Program has provided Texas with an opportunity to achieve real reductions
in emissions from the facilities that hold these permits. as can be measured by the significant
improvements in air quality in Texas' Nonattainmcnt areas.
Although GCLC's members do not currently rely on this permitting pro gram, we belie ve it has
erved the State wel l.
It is therefore in the interest of the EPA and the TCEQ to resolve any
remaining issues and eliminate uncertainty as soon as possible.
C ON CL USION
Based on all
0 f the issues set out above, GC LC is concerned that the EPA has injected
uncertaint y
into
the
Texas
regulatory
framework
witho ut
any
prom ise
of
addi tional
environmental protection.
Uncertainty will lead to increased costs to suppliers of electricity.
fuels, and products, whi ch will in turn lead to increased prices for consumers across the country
during a time when Ame rican consumers are economically vulnerable and Texas is working to
create jobs and provide affordable and reliable electricity for a growing population. We remain
hopeful that EPA will avoid this outcome by working to the resolve these issues without the need
for SIP disapproval.
GCLC appreciates the opportunity to file these comments and welcomes
participation in processes in the future to informall y resolve the issues addressed in this
comment.

Mr. Stanley Spruiell
Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA 1s proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ 1s current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five

Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of

allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning

Please encourage Texas to support clean sources of energy.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.  Texans deserve better.  We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in

place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.  Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
When I moved to Texas as a 3 year old I began experiencing problems
with asthma. Now as a 22 year old I still have asthma problems and I
can't help but thinking the quality of our air has something to do with
it. If our state agencies can't or won't do their job, then as a
national body please do yours and step in and do what's right.
Thank You.

applaud EPA1s proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ 
air 
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and 
should be 
thrown out. 
That was a good first step. Now is the time for the EPA to 
take bold 
action by: 
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by 
TCEQ 
utilizing TCEQ1s current illegal policy 
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired 
power 
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating 
under the 
Federal Clean Air Act standards 
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants - -  
no 
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing 
all 
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and 
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in 
accordance 
with the Federal Clean Air Act. 
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming 
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow 
existing 
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions. 

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants 
than any 
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on 
the top 
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past 
five 
years. Texans deserve better. We cannot let coal stand in the 
way of 
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules 
in 
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for 
their mess 
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting 
process are 
allowed to proceed forward. Strong regulations are vital to 
cleaning 
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy 
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas 
and 
protects our air quality, health and communities.

Re:

Federal Register Notice
Disapproving
Portions of TCEQ's
Most Recent
State
Implementation Plan Revision Submittal
Dear SirlMadam:
In the subject dockets, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has expressed major concerns with
the Qualified Facilities State Program, Flexible Permit Program and the New Source Review (NSR)
Reform State Implementation Plan (SIP) that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)
currently has in place or has proposed. The EPA takes issue with the regulations the TCEQ enforces
alleging a lack of specificity regarding definitions and general lack of checks and balances to ensure that
federal requirements are met during the referenced state's permitting processes in addition to not meeting
the Minor NSR Source SIP, Major Source NSR SIP, including the Major Source NSR Nonattainment SIP
requirements.
Those concerns, currently unaddressed by the TCEQ, have ultimately resulted in the
proposed disapproval portions of the TCEQ's most recent SIP amendment proposal which is critical to
ensuring that the air quality in the Houston, Galveston Brazoria (HGB) area returns to levels compliant
with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
Harris County Public Health & Environmental Services (HCPHES) is very concerned that the above
TCEQ programs have been determined by the EPA to fall short of federal requirements. As such,
HCPHES encourages the EPA to aggressively pursue the timely correction ofthese deficiencies to ensure
the health, safety and well being ofthe citizens ofHarris County.
Additionally, HCPHES has been, and continues to be, concerned that the public participation process is
not user friendly with regards to timeliness ofinitial notification and time restrictions for public comment.
Specifically, it is not uncommon for a permit modification or amendment notification to be delayed on
occasion thus resulting in a shorter period for citizens as well as HCPHES to respond. These situations
have unduly limited the opportunities for the public and affected agencies to be able to provide
meaningful reviews and submit appropriate comments,

In summary, HCPHES supports the EPA's conclusion to disapprove portions of the SIP as proposed until
such time the TCEQ addresses all of the specifics noted in the Federal Register. In addition, HCPHES
strongly supports strengthening the public participation rules such that Texas citizens are able to
participate meaningfully in the process.
HCPHES appreciates the opportunity to comment on these proposals.
Should you have any questions,
please contact Stuart Mueller - Air Administrator, Environmental Public Health Division, HCPHES, at

EPA-R06·0AR-2006-0133
Dear Mr. Spruiell:
We, members of the Texas legislature, support the EPA's proposed disapproval of
the air permitting program submittals from the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality regarding: (1) Flexible Permits, (2) Qualified Facilities. and (3) Major and Minor
New Source Review.
While we support the inherent flexibility in the federal Clean Air Act allowing states
to decide how best to reduce air pollution to safe levels, we recognize that this flexibility
must be exercised within the context of a functioning. transparent, process that protects
the public's right-to-know and ability to participate in air permitting decisions that can
affect their health and welfare. We believe that the current Texas procedures for issuing
air permits fail to meet these standards for reasons including those identified below.
We are particularly concerned with the Texas program's lack of transparency, which
thwarts public participation and makes enforcement of legallimits very difficult. Air
quality affects the health and safety of our constituents and we look forward to working
with you and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to ensure that Texas has an
air-permitting program that meets federal standards, values transparency and public input,
and protects the health and safety of all Texans.
1. Flexible Permit Program
We agree with EPA's determination that the Texas Flexible Permit program should
be disapproved. The federal Clean Air Act does allow for flexibility and streamlining in air
permitting. The Texas Flexible Permit program, however, goes too far in sacrificing
transparency. monitoring and enforceability in the name offlexibility. Further, it allows

\ Ir. S'anky ~ . S"""",O<II
.....<mba B . 2009
,.,. 2<>0
major sources of air pollution to avoid compliance with importa nt regulatory limits. In
particular, we are concerned with:
•
The lack ofadequa ~ monitoring and reporting requirements, ind uding the
routine use of emission estimates based on calculations rather than actual
monitori ng..
•
Inadequate public participation. The Flexible Permit rules rail to provide
adequate public notice or participation fur draft permits and changes to
existing permits, which keeps the surrounding communities uninformed
about any changes in the pollution levels they are breathing.
•
Thefailure to require compliance with, or monitoring or reporting pursuant to,
federal individuol unit pallutionlimits.
While we do befteve that the TCEQcan provide some flexibility In permitting. such
as pre-approving modifications, we do not believe that the flexible permit approach in the
current Texas rules is viable. We, therefore, support disa pproval of the rules.
2. Qualified Filcllities
While the Qualified Facilities program was a legislative creation, we recognize that
the statutory language and associated regulation s are inconsistent with current federal
Oean Air Act requirements regarding mod ifications and public participation-In pa rticular,
we are concerned with:
•
Inadequate TCEQoversight. The rules authorize many changes at facilities
without any pre-approval by TCEQ or procedures for den ial fur ca use. These
off·permit thanges are difficult to track and enforce and may threaten
ambient air quality.
•
The lack of underswndoble and traceable permits.Texas industry, regulators,
and the public should be able to obtain a permit, read it, and know what
quantity of wha t polluta nts the facility is authorized to emit. The off-permit
changes au thorized through the Qualified Facilities rules prevent such
transparency.
•
Inadequate public participation. The Qualified Faclhties rules allow industrial
plants to make changes that can affect neighboring residents with absolutely
no public notice or opportunity for participation.
We. therefore, support final disapproval of the Qualified Facilities rules.
3. Major and Minor New Source Review
Lastly, the EPAshould finalize disapproval of revisions to the Major and Minor New
Source Review SIP beca use they are substantively different and less stringent than the
federal New Source Review rules. Of particular concern is Texas' definition and application
of Best Available Control Technology (BACT). Texas is applying a de finition of BACT. and
using a BACT dete rmination process, that is significantly less stringent than required by
federal law. As a result, Texas industrial facilities emi t more poUution than similar facilities

""""_ 23. 2\."",
r .
J <>f l
in other states. However, use of federal BACT alone will not be sufficient for the State to
achieve and maintain attainment of the NAAQS and protect the health of the communities
downwind of these new sources. We recommend that the EPA also adopt the procedures
necessary to ensure that TCEQ has nplicit authority and direction to analyze individual
and cumulative effects of emissions from proposed significant point sources on regional
ozone levels when considering a permit appliation. Analysis ofozone effects should
include photochemical modeling of impacts to downwiod areas under typical high caone
conditions. Beca use the Texas New Source Review revision rules rail in numerous ways to
meet federal requirements and to protect public health, we support their disapprovaL
Condusion
We are pleased that EPA is taking steps to ensure that the Texas air permitting
PI""O(:E'SScomplies with federal law and is protective of public health. We believe that a
strong,. effective, transparent air program is important for all Texans and will ultimately
redlice permitting umeunes. cost and liligation.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ 1s current
illega~ policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old l
dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ 1s illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth,
creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
If you care for the health of Texans,
the Clean Air Act in Texas MUST
BE ENFORCED.

The TCEQ is poised to give an air permit to a pet-coke plant in my
town, Corpus Christi, and we are all very upset about it -- so much so
that we are considering moving away from Corpus if the plant (Las
Brisas) is built. The TCEQ is not considering all of the emissions the
plant will produce and the Texas Toxicologist that just testified at
the hearing said that it wasn't going to hurt the people here. We all
know that is nonsense and feel like the TCEQ is pushing this plant
through even though the community doesn't want it. The City Council is
supporting it because of all the money the plant is promising them. But
the Council is not considering the citizen's health.
Please put a stop to the Texas Coal Rush -- it's ruining our lives here

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies
~nd
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ 1s illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning

I personally beleive that wind energy and solar energy are more
environmentally sound and esthetically less invasive.

Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming

Texas should be ashamed and embarrassed about its lazy attitude towards
the fact that it is the #1 state in the nation in regards to carbon
emissions;
and we've even been increasing these harmful emissions at
that!
What, a sad picture we are painting for our future generations J
Texas is a state that has strong roots in family values.
It is way
beyond time for us to understand that family values is synonymous with
caring for the environment t
and our family is and will always be a part
of it---whether it is thriving or dying.
Neglecting our natural
environment is neglecting our children, their children t
and so on the
privilege to enjoy a beautiful healthy world.
Texans deserve better
and t
yes t
although many need to be woken up more effectively to the
fact that we all are necessary to have this change for the better, it
is vital that our government remains wise about the choices that it
makes to protect its people.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong,
enforced
rules in place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for
their mess and that no permits issued under TCEQ 1s illegal permitting
process are allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are
absolutely necessary to clean up the energy industry,
and they will
most certainly put us on the path to clean energy technology.
More
clean technology means a boost in economic growth and the creation of
more progressive jobs in Texas that protect our air quality, health and

communities.
It1s only common sense that we steer away from coal,
because what good is a fist full of dollars if we can't breathe?

TCC is a statewide trade association representing over 70 chemical manufacturers with more
than 200 Texas facilities . Our industry has invested more than $50 billion in physical assets in
the state and pays over $1 billion annually in state and local taxes. TCC's members provide
approximately 70,000 direct jobs and over 400,000 indirect jobs to Texans across the state. TCC
member companies manufacture products that improve the quality of life for all Americans. The
products manufactured in Texas account for 60 percent of the U.S. chemical production, which
go into millions of consumer products. Chemicals are the state 's largest export with over $30
billion each year.
TCC has a keen interest in ensuring that the Texas air permitting programs are ultimately
approved by EPA as our member companies utilize or are subject to the permitting programs and
requirements that EPA is proposing to disapprove through its rulemakings. Thank you in
advance for consideration of these comments. Please do not hesitate to contact me at (512) 646-

on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submittals which
date back 15 years ago to 1994. The effect of such widespread disapproval could be to nullify
existing Texas air permitting programs such as the state Flexible Permits and Qualified Facilities
Programs and certain state-issued Standard Permits, in addition to threatening the viability of the
state's existing Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and New Source Review
(NSR) Reform initiatives. EPA stated that all three actions should be read together ""because the
permits issued under these State programs are the vehicles for regulating a significant universe of
thc air emissions from sources in Texas and thus directly impact the ability of the State to
achieve and maintain attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and
to protect the health of the communities where these sources are 10cated.,,1
It would be irresponsible and short-sighted for the programs to be analyzed in a vacuum, apart
from a thorough and detailed analysis of thc dramatic improvements that have occurred in air
quality in Texas over the past 15 years, particularly in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB)
nonattainment area, where the majority ofTCC members operate. With regard to the NAAQS
for ozone, it is important to first highlight the contributors to nitrogen oxide (NO,) emissions in
the area. In the HBG nonattainment area, 55% of NO, emissions come from on and off-road
mobile sources, 35% are from point sources, and 10% are from area sources.' Notwithstanding
the chemical industry's lesser role to mobile sources in the contribution of NO, emissions in the
HGB nonattainment area, TCC member companies have worked with other industrial partners to
invest more than $3 billion since 200 1 to achieve an 80 percent reduction of NO, from point
sources. A critical factor in this accomplishment is TCEQ's commitment to reduce emissions
through a robust air permitting process. For example, the Flexible Permits Program allows for
voluntary and mandatory permitting requirements for previously grandfathcred facilities. This
program has resulted in over 260,000 tons of reductions in actual emissions from otherwise
I 74 Fed . Reg. at 48483.

I

unregulated grandfathered facilities either through the addition ofcontrols or the shutdown of
these facilities.' Additionally, in the HGB nonatlainment area, the design values for both the 1-
hour and 8-hour ozone standards have been dropping steadily between 1999 and 2009 from 203
parts per billion (ppb) to 127 ppb, and from 118 ppb to 84 ppb, respectively."" Similar
improvements have been obtained in all parts ofTexas. Decreases in air emissions of this
magnitude in the midst of rapid population growth are remarkable accomplishments in improved
air quality that must not be ignored,
Furthermore, the Houston area has the most extensive air monitoring network in the country. By
2008, almost all the monitors in Houston were in attainment with the 0.08 parts per million
(ppm) 8-hour ozone standard. With regard to emissions ofvolatile organic compounds (YOCs),
in 2008 no monitors in Harris County were above the long-term effects screening level for
benzene, and all monitors in the Houston area showed a decrease in average benzene
concentrations from 2005-2008.5 The TCEQ also maintains an Air Pollutant Watch List
(APWL), which is a list ofareas in Texas where specific pollutants are measured at levels of
concern. The purpose of the APWL is to heighten public awareness in areas of concern for
interested parties, encourage efforts to reduce emissions, enable TCEQ to most effectively
manage its resources and assist in the review of air permits. Currently, there are 12 APWL areas
in II Texas countie s. Over the past two years, six pollutants have been removed from the
APWL, and seven more pollutants in five APWL areas arc proposed to be removed later this
year. Again, improvement in air quality of this magnitude in a state with increasing population
and a sound economy is an impressive achievement to say the least.
II. THE FLEXIIIL E PERMITS PROGRAM
In the proposed rule, EPA proposes disapproval of the Texas Flexible Permits Program for
failure to meet the requirements for a substitute Major NSR SIP revision. In addition to the
program's alleged failures to protect Major NSR SIP requirements, EPA states that it cannot find
that the program, as a Minor NSR SIP program, will ensure protection of the NAAQS and
noninterference with the Texas SIP control strategies and reasonable further progress (RFP).
TCC supports full approval of the state's Flexible Permits Program. Contrary to EPA's
allegations, the Texas Flexible Permits Program is a robust, legally defensible program that is
intended to add operational flexibility through the use of emission caps, certain control
technology and other operational practices to achieve emission reductions with the ultimate goal

of having a well-controlled facility after the final cap is implemented. To that end, a Flexible
Permit is an alternative to the traditional Minor NSR authori zation6 and is not a mechanism used
to determine federal NSR applicability, such as PSD or nonattainment. The Program does not
allow new stationary sources to construct without a Major NSR permit if a determ ination is made
that one is necessary.
As clearly stated in TCEQ's Flexible Permits Program rules, if a facility applying for a Flexible
Permit is located in a nonattainment area, the facility shall comply with all applicable
requirements concerning nonattainment review. ' Likewise, if a facilit y applying for a Flexible
Permit is located in an attainme nt area, the facility shall comply with all applicable PSD
requi rements."" Federal applicability determinations arc conducted according to federal rules and
requirements, including determining baseline emissions, the project emissions increase, and the
net emissions increa se. Under the Program, Best Available Control Technology (BACT) is used
to establish the applicable caps,"" and the review includes a NAAQS analysis ifPSD is
triggcred.!"" Additionally, the review includes lowest achievable emissions rate (LAER) control
technology and the use of offsets ifnonattainment review is triggered.II The Flexible Permits
Program transparently requires that an NSR applicability determination be made, and the
Program is not structured to circumvent Major NSR SIP requirements.
EPA has also noted the following specific issues with the Texas Flexible Permits Program.
TCC's response follows each of the noted concerns.
•
EPA states that thc Program is inconsistent with thc intent that Flexible Permits will
only apply to minor sources, existing grandfathcrcd sources and to minor
modifications. In light of that analysis, EPA examined thc program as an equivalent to
a Major NSR Program and determined that it was an inadequate equivalent. EPA also
stated that there are no provisions in the Program that require a Major NSR
applicability determination prior to construction and/or modification. 12
First, the federal Clean Air Act and the corresponding regulations are virtually silent on
specific direction to the states as to how each state's minor NSR program is to be constructed

and implemented.13 That said, states are given significant flexibility in the implementation of
such programs. Notably, EPA recently recognized the importance of this necessary
flexibility in the federal Flexible Air Permitting Rule.14 In Texas, for example, this
flexibility has served as the cornerstone for a successful air permitting program that has
resulted in tremendous environmental benefit.
TCEQ rules allow for the usc of a Flexible Permit for minor source facilities at a major
source site. TCEQ rules state that ""[a] person may obtain a flexible permit which allows for
physical and operational changes as provided by this subchapter as an alternative to obtaining
a new source review permit under §11 6.11 0... A person may obtain a flexible permit under
§116.711ofthis title for a facility, group of facilities, or account before any actual work is
begun...,,15 A review of §116.1 10 (under Subchapter B, New Source Review Permits) lists
the Flexible Permit as one of many permitting options required before work is begun on ((
facility, and notably, the Flexible Permit is listed among the other minor source permitting
options, such as Permits by Rule and Standard Permits. As noted above, §116.711 requires
that facilities are subject to nonattainment and PSD review as applicable. It is clear that
TCEQ's rules do not intend for the Flexible Permits Program to serve as an equivalent to a
Major NSR Program. It is also evident that TCEQ rules require a Major NSR applicability
determination prior to construction and/or modification.
•
EPA states that the Texas definition of "" modification"" is not clearly at least as stringent
as th e definition of "" modification"" in EPA's Major NSR SIP rules. EPA believes that
the state has failed to submit a demonstration showing how its usc of ""modification"" is
at least as stringent as the federal definition of ""modifieation.,,16
TCEQ rules provide two separate ""modification"" definitions. Briefly, a ""major
modification"" 17 is a project action that triggers federal NSR review (PSD or Nonattainment).
In contrast, the TCEQ 's minor source program uses the definition of ""modification of an
existing facility"" 18 to determine if a proposed change triggers minor NSR review, and the
13 CAA § I I0(a)(2)(C); 40 CFR §§ 5 I.160-51. I64.

scope ofthe change is not limited to pollutants that are federally regulated. TCEQ has
explicitly stated that the Flexible Permits Program rules and the definition of ""modification
of an existing facility"" do not act as a shield for federal NSR permitting."" Again, the
Program requires a review of federal NSR applicability steps."" For projects that trigger
federal review, all required demonstrations, such as BACT, de minimislNAAQS modeling,
increment modeling, and toxicological modeling are conducted. For projects that trigger
nonattainment review, LAER and offsets are required."" It is therefore difficult to ascertain
how EPA can allege that the state's definition of ""modification"" is not at least as stringent as
the federal definition.
•
EPA is concerned that thc definition of ""account"" may result in an emissions cap that
could apply to multiple major stationary sources, thus circumventing Major NSR
t
ti
,
22
prccons rue IOn review,
EPA notes that the Texas SIP defines the term ""account"" to ""include an entire company site,
which could include more than one plant and certainly more than one stationary source...
Accordingly, under a Flexible Permit, a single emissions limitation in the emission cap could
apply to major stationary sources, and if emissions remain below the emissions limitations in
the emission cap, Major NSR preconstruction review is not triggered.t'':'
Under TCEQ's rules, the term ""account"" means ""all sources that are aggregated as a site.,,24
Under Texas law, the term ""source"" means ""a point of origin of air contaminants, whether
privately or publicly owned or opcrated.?"" When analyzed, it is clear that the term
""account"" could not include more than one plant or more than one stationary source as EPA
has interpreted the Texas definitions. An account is clearly limited to the source or site.
Furthermore, the Program does not circumvent Major NSR preconstruction review. A
Flexible Permit is a Minor NSR permit authorization that is utilized in some cases to cover
minor source facilities at a major source site. Where facilities or pieces of equipment are
authorized under a PSD andlor Nonattainment permit, those federal requirements still apply.

No facilities located at the source are exempt from federal permitting requirements, including
Major NSR preconstruction review where applicable.
Flexibl e Permits usually contain two emissions caps - an initial emissions cap and a final
emissions cap. The initial emissions cap is the starting point prior to any physical or
operational changes and is based on the control s in place at the time the Flexible Permit is
first issued. The final emissions cap applie s after all control upgrades have been pnt into
place and is based on the application of BACT to all facilities contributing to an emissions
cap.26 Additi onally, interim caps are sometimes utilized, which provide emissions limits at
various stages between the implementation of the initial emissions cap and the final
emISSIOns cap.
Flexible Permits also use individual emissions limitations for each pollutant not covered by
an emissions cap for facilities covered by the Flexible Penllit.27 Individual emissions
limitations may also be used in conjunction with the emissions cap when it is necessary to
ensure protection of the NAAQS. Specific emission limits that an individual facilit y cannot
exceed may also be establi shed to ensure that federal permitting requirements are not
circumvented.i"" Finally, all Flexible Permit s require permit holders to comply with state and
federal rules, regulations and commission orders, and conditions as precedent to the granting
of the permit.i""
•
EPA states that the Flexible Permits Program fails to adequately show how emissions
increases arc calculated for the entire major stationary source if the source is subject to
two different permitting regulations - the state Flexible Permits Program regulations
and federal Major NSR SIP ,·egulations.JO
In the proposal, EPA remarks that not all emission points, units facilities, major stationary
sources, minor modifications to an existing major stationary source, and so forth, at a site are
required to be included in the source's Flexible Permit. Notably, EPA acknowledges that this
is not perse inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and EPA's Major NSR SIP requirements.""
However, EPA expressed its concern that the Program fails to explain how physical and
operational changes that occur under a Flexible Permit emissions cap arc evaluated for Major
NSR applicability.

Again, the permitting authorization method used at a source does not exempt any of the
facilities located at that source from federal permitting requirements. If a source has a
flexible permit that does not contain all thc facilities located at that source and a project
within the flexible permit triggers netting, all facilities (under the cap and outside the cap) at
thc source are evaluated to determine whether a net significant emissions increase at the
source has occurred. If the resulting net emissions increase is significant, federal NSR is
triggered.""
•
EPA is concerned that thc Flexible Permits Program would authorize cxisting
allowable, rather than actual emissions, to bc used to determine applicability in
violation of the Clean Air' Act and thc Major NSR SIP requtrcmcntsr""
Flexible Permit emission caps arc based on allowable emissions. The final emission caps arc
based on the application of BACT at the time the Flexible Permit is created. In many
situations, the application of BACT to the facilities subject to the emission cap results in an
allowable that is lower than the pre-change actual emissions , If netting is required, and the
netting analysis reveals an emissions increase, then the project is considered a major
modification and the appropriate federal NSR program is triggered.""
When TCEQ is evaluating emissions increases on a project level, the Program requires the
use of actual baseline emissions to determine whether a project will result in an increase that
triggers NSR applicability.
•
EP A is concerned with thc adequacy of the recordkccping, reporting, tracking and
monitoring requirements of thc Flexible Permits Program.""
TCEQ's Flexible Permits Program rules contain recordkeeping requirements and also specify
that additional requirements may be specified in special conditions attached to the Flexible
Penn it.36 Generally, these special conditions may include compliance stack testing, periodic
stack testing, continuous emissions monitoring (CEMS) where appropriate and other
parametric monitoring requirements, along with recordkeeping to ensure that the permit
holder can comply with the emission caps and BACT.37 Because there is a significant

difference in the types of sources that apply for a Flexible Permit, it is difficult for the TCEQ
to implement rulemaking to incorporate every type of recordkeeping, monitoring and
tracki ng requirements that may appl y. Attempting to incorporate these variable components
into one comprehensive rule could severely limit TCEQ's ability to adequately implement
these requirements.
•
EPA finds that the publie participation aspects of thc Flexible Permits Program arc

the commission in December 2009 a proposed public participation rulemaking as permitted
under existing statutory authority to address EPA 's concerusr""
That said, any future changes
in the public participation aspects of the Program should apply prospectively and should have
no effect on existing permits.
•
Under Minor NSR source review, EPA states that the Flexible Permits Program lacks
the specific procedures necessary to determine how the source 01' state will calculate the
emissions cap, determine the coverage of a Flexible Permit, and establish individual
emissions limitations fOI' each site. Furthermore, EPA is not clear on what the process
is and how the emissions cap is adjusted for the addition of new facilities. Finally, EPA
statcs that the Program needs more detailed monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting
requirements to ensure that the emission caps and/or the individual emission limitations
are enforceable,
The Flexible Permit is an optional alternative permitting tool that may be used by a source to
authorize a facility, group of facilitie s or an entire account site (i.e., a source). There is
nothi ng in the Flexible Permits Program that shields a source from federal permitting
requirements, The emission caps are based on the application of BACT and reviews of the
modeling/health effects data. The monitoring, testing and recordkeeping tools are used to
help ensure that a minor source does not become a major source. For control technology
protection, the Flexible Permit rules state that the existing level of control may not be
reduced for any facilit y, and the emissions from all facilities contained in a Flexible Permit
are included in either an emission cap or an individual emission limitation.4o

III. NSR REFORM
In thc proposed rules, EPA is proposing disapproval of submittals from TCEQ to revise the
Texas Major and Minor NSR SIP. Specifically, EPA has expressed concerns with Texas rules as
thcy relate to PSD Review, Nonattainment Review, plantwide applicability limitations (PALs)
and state-issued Standard Permits for Pollution Control Projects (PCPs).
TCC supports full approval of the state's NSR reform SIP submittals. EPA's specific concerns
and TCC's responses are below:
•
With regard to PSD review, EPA disapproves of the state definition ofBAeT. EPA
also disapproves of the state's rules because they do not strictly comply with Clean Air
Act requirements that a facility may not be constructed unless it will comply with
BACT Iimits. 41
EPA states that ""the State PSD SIP must both require BACT and apply the federal definition
of BACT (or one that is more stringent) to be approved.,,42 In a recent Ictter to EPA, Mr.
Vickery committed to EPA that TCEQ will address the definition of BACT through an
upcoming rulemaking.'? Although TCC believes that the state 's application of BACT is
cons istent with federal requirements as explained in detail below, we support this TCEQ
initiative to update the definition of BACT. That said, any future changes in the BACT
definition should apply prospectively and should have no effect on existing permits.
EPA's proposal to disapprove this rule is based in part on false distinctions between what it
refers to as ""PSD BACT"" and ""Minor NSR BACT."" Assuming such distinctions, EPA
concludes that the Texas rules fail to clearly apply the ""PSD definition of BACT"" to all
actions subject to PSD, and conversely fails to delimit the minor NSR definition to activities
triggering only minor NSR. But there are no distinctions, legal or practical, in Texas BACT
reviews.
Texas law does not create two different types ofpermits, one called a minor NSR permit and
one called a PSD pennit. There is only one kind of pre-construction permit described in the
Texas Clean Air Act, a ""preconstruction permit"" under Texas Health & Safety Code §
382.05 18. The issuance of all such permits is conditioned on use of ""best available control
technology"":

""(b) The commission shall grant within a reasonable time a permit or permit amendme nt
to construct or modify a facility if, from the information available to the commission,
including information presented at any hearing held under Section 382.056(k), the
commission finds:
(I) the proposed facility for which a permit, permit amendment, or a special
permit is sought will use at least the best available control technology,
considering the technical practicability and economi c reasonableness of reducing
or eliminating the emissions resulting from the facility; and
(2) no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene the intent of
this chapter, including protection of the public's health and physical propcrty.T ""
One can search the entire Texas Clean Air Act-which is the sole authority under which
TCEQ can issue any permits-and find no mention ofPSO at all; again, the governing law
establishes the need for BACT for all permits, major or minor. And the governing statute
does not define BACT beyond its own terms, leaving substantial degrees of freedom for
TCEQ to compel the best available control technology. TCEQ's implementing rules also do
not further define BACT at all, either, other than to emphasize the need for giving
""consideration .. . to the technical practicability and the economic reasonableness of reducin g
or eliminating emissions from the facility.,,45
Texas accomplishes the PSO reviews required by Part C of Subtitle I of the federal Clean Air
Act by including various applicability provisions in its rules, but the only effect of
""triggering"" PSO review is to require an increment analysis (the ""significant deterioration""
review) for all preconstruction permits for I'SO projects. Again, BACT reviews are
universal, and do not depend on triggering PSO. (This is one of the great strengths of
Texas's permitting program, not a weakness). The nature of the BACT review doesn't
change depending on whether the application triggers I'SO: TCEQ determines BACT using
its 3-tiered process regardless of the size of project under review.
EPA is conditioning its approval on TCEQ adoption of precisely the same definition of
BACT that EPA has chosen. But EPA has no foundation for that condition as further
outlined in the five following points.

I. EPA May not Condition Approval ofTcxas's Permitting Programs on Adherence
to Spccific Definitions
SIP approval of a PSD program is conditioned on accomplishing some very general statutory
objectives, as outlined in Section I65(a) of the federal Clean Air Act, including mechanisms
to ensure that each proposed major source or modification is subject to the best available
control technology.""
Congress expressly left the particulars to each state.""
Not even EPA's
rules describing its expectations for approvable SIPs mandate adoption of the exact
defini tions: Variations are allowed ""if the State specifically demonstrates that the submitted
definition is more stringent, or at least as stringent, in all respects"" as those adopted by
EPA.48 TCEQ of course has made that demonstration in its various SIP submittals over the
years, but mostly by decades ofactual BACT determinations made pursuant to its definition.
EPA has not identified even one TCEQ BACT determination that yielded an inadequate
result because of the different definitions,
In fact, EPA has agreed that the TCEQ BACT review process is perfectly adequate. When
EPA granted Texas's PSD program complete SIP approval in 1992, EPA accepted complete
exclusion of the federal control technology review provisions (codified at 40 CFR 52.210)):
""[B]ecause the [Texas Air Control Board] claimed that the Texas Clean Air Act and the
existing State regulations have provisions for application of BACT as stringent as the
Federal requirements in reviewing the permit applications. The EPA review of the Texas
Clean Air Act and Regulation VI (Sections 11 6.3(a)(3) through 116.3(a)(5)) have indeed
revealed that existing TACB permit requirements meet the provisions ofthe Federal PSD
regulations...,,49
The final rule approving the Texas PSD program affirmed that incorporation of the federal
control technology review provision ""not necessary for approval of the Texas Program.,, 50
2. Definitions Do Not Determine Stringency
The stringency of BACT determinations are not determined by definitions, anyway. Even
the far wordier ""federal definition"" is but a litany of factors that go into what is inevitably a
4. CAA § 165(a)(4): 42 U.S.C. § 7475(a)(4).

highly discretion-laden determination. A more ""specific"" definition, it may truly bc argued,
has the effect ofbeing less stringent, because it limits the factors to bc considered. Absent a
definition of BACT beyond its own self-description, TCEQ is free to be even stricter than the
wordier federal definition. Again, the proposed disapproval fails to identify even one
determination that (a) depended on the definition applied, and (b) yielded a determination
less strict than would resulted from application of the ""federal definition.""
3. El'A Itself Does Not Follow the ""Federal Definition""
EPA is in a difficult position to insist on word-for-word adoption when it does not itself
follow the federal definition. The definition EPA would impose on the states is not the one
that Congress prescribes. Thc following shows the changes needed to the EPA rule in order
to conform it to the statute:
(12) Best available control technology means an emissions limitation (including a visible
emission standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each pollutant subject
to regulation under Act which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary
source or major modification which the Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, taking
into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is
achievab le for such source or modification through application ofprod uction processes or
available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or
innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall
application of best available control technology result in emissions of any pollutant which
would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR parts 60
and 61. If the Admi nistrator determines that technological or economic limitations on the
application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the
imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice,
operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the
requirement for the application of best available control technology. Such standard shall,
to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of
such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by
means which achieve equivalent results.
Which federal definition would EPA like Texas to follow, the one in its rule or the one in its
governing statute? In what way does either ""federal definition"" necessarily require BACT
determinations any more strict than the Texas definition?
12

4. The Pro posed Disapproval Draws on Distinctions With out Differenc es
The defin ition is designed to identify relevant factors that go into what is ultimately a highly
discretion-laden determination.
No matter the definition, the objective is the same. And no
matter the definitions, the resources consulted for each BACT determination are the same. In
Texas, for example, all BACT determinations are made using its 3-tier process, which
elaborates in detai l how TCEQ makes the determinations. All reviews are based on
consideration of national determinations codified in the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse,
EPA has agreed that this process yields results equivalent to its top-down approach, which
itself is not compelled by any defin ition. In both cases, responsible agencies make
discreti onary determinations based on aggressive efforts to ensure that ncw technologies are
applied when thcy become available to new sources. Pharisaical parsing over defin itions
does not accomplish sound BACT determinations, which instead result from good faith
efforts by responsible regulators.
5. To the Vel')' Extent There Were Differences in Result Based on Definition, EPA
Would be Prohibited front Disapproving the Definition
EPA presumes without proof a difference in result arising out of TCEQ's BACT defi nition.
But, regardless, EPA cannot elect to approve the broader reach ofthc Texas program (e.g.,
application of BACT to all sources), but disapprove what it perceives to be a lesser definition
of BACT. States are the primary architects oftheir implementation plans, and EPA is not
free to change the state's choices by selective approvals of interrelated elements.""
st An unbroken line of cases, starting with Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Gorsuch, 742 F.2d 1028 (7th Cir. 1984), holds
that the Clean Air Act, placing in the states the ""primary responsibility"" for protecting air quality, does not allow
EPA change the stringency of the plan as developed by the state; EPA may only approve or disapprove what the
state submits. In one case rejecting EPA's decision to approve a sulfur dioxide limit but not the averaging
conventions that were part of the rule, Judge Posner offered words that counsels against using the SIP machete with
which EPA proposes to hack apart Texas's air quality permitting program:
.. . nothing in the Act or in any cases we have found suggests that the EPA, when asked to
approve a revised plan, can, without pausing to decide whether a limitation in the plan that its
authors may have thought critical to its soundness has any merit at all, approve the plan minus
the limitation. The plan might be vastly better with than without the limitation, and the agency
cannot determine that without examining the limitation. Even if it is not vastly better, section
I to(a)(3)(A) requires the Administrator to approve a revised plan, limitations and all, if he
determines that it meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act; and he cannot make that
determination ifhe refuses to evaluate the limitations.

Accordingly, thc extent to which EPA would make any substantive changes in TCEQ's
permitting program by selectively disapproving its BACT definition is the very extent to
which it is forbidden to disapprove it. EPA must either accept the permit program or rejcct it
in its entirety, and not cut it to pieces so that it looks like a ransom note.
•
With regard to Nonattainment Review, El'A disapproves the state rules because they
require affirmative regulatory action by the EPA before the l-hour ozone major
nonattainment NSR requirements come into effect in the Texas I-hour ozonc
nonattainment areas.52
EPA points to the D.C. Circuit Court decision in South Coast Air Quality Management
District v. EPA, where the court vacated federal rules that waived obligations under thc
revoked I-hour standard for NSR.53 EPA states that the effect of this portion of the court's
ruling is to restore major nonattainment NSR applicability thresholds and emission offsets
pursuant to classifications previously in effect for areas designated nonattainment for the 1-
hour ozone standard.I"" In response to the court' s ruling in South Coast, EPA has stated on
numerous occasions that it would go forward with rulemaking to implement thc I-hour ozone
requi rements.""
Therefore, it is reasonable for TCEQ to understand that some EPA action is
necessary before it proceeds with appropriate rule changes to reinstate thc major
nonattainment NSR applicability thresholds and emission offset requirements, and this is not
a rational basis upon which to justify disapproving the state's rules.
•

EI'A states that the Clean Air Act and NSR SIP rules require that an applicability
determination regarding whether Major NSR applies for a pollutant should be based upon the
attainment or nonattainment designation of thc area in which the source is located on the date
ofissuance of the Major NSR permit. TCEQ rules state that the nonattainment NSR

designated nonattainment areas after the effective date of the rules, the nonattainmcnt NSR
requi rements appl y the day the application is admi nistratively complete. The day the
application is determined to be admini stratively complete occurs prior to the issuance date of
the perm it. Therefore, the state's rules arc more stringent than the federal rules in this regard.
•
EPA states that it has many conce rns with TCEQ's implementation of th e federal PAL
program. First, EPA disapproves the Texas SIP submittals becau se th ey fail to limit
applica bility of a PAL only to an existing major stationary source.i""
Federa l rules state PALs are available only for existing major stationary sources because they
arc based on a source's actual cmissions.i"" TCEQ rules specify that any application for a
PAL permit or a PAL permit amendment must include calculations of the baseline actual
emissions with supporting documentation.i"" A new stationary source would not have this
documentation to submit. It is clear that the state's rules limit the applicability of a PAL to
an existing major stationary source.
•
Second, EPA rejects thc state's PAL SIP submittals because there are no provisions
that relate to PAL re-openings, nor is there a mandate that failure to usc a monitoring
system that meets the federal requirements renders the PAL invalid.61
A PAL issued under state rules is effective for 10 years.62 The state's rules provide for the
revalidation of the data used to establish the PAL pollutant at least once every five years.""
There are also regulatory procedures in place for the amendments or alterations of a PAL.M
Finally, the state's rules specify that a source's PAL monitoring system that utilizes a CEMS
to monitor PAL pollutant emissions must comply with applicable specifications found in40

•
Third, EPA disapproves the Texas SIP submittals because the Texas rules provide for
an emissions cap that may not acconnt for all of thc emissions of a pollutant at the
major stationary source. According to EPA, inclnsion of all thc emissions nnits subject
to the enforceable PAL limit is essential. EPA statcs that the Texas submittal is unciem'
as to whether the PAL would apply to all of thc emission units at the entire major
stationary source and therefore appears to be less stringent than the federal rulcs.66
TCEQ's PAL rules clearl y state that ""the plant-wide applicability limit (PAL) will impose an
annual emission limitation in tons per year, that is enforceable for all facilities included in the
PAL.,,67 The PAL program is not comparable to the Texas Flexible Perm it Program, which
may apply to only certain facilities at a source,
•
Fourth, EPA rejects thc public participation aspect of thc state's PAL progrllln.68
TCEQ Executive Director Mark Vickery has already indicated to EPA that he will present to
the commission in December 2009 a proposed public participation rulemaking as permitted
under existing statutory authority to address EPA's concerns.f"" That said, any future changes
in the public participation aspects of the Program should apply prospectively and should have
no effect on existing permits.
•
EI'A also states that the term ""baselin e actual emissions"" does not require thc inclusion
of emissions resulting from startups, shutdowns and malfunctions. Further, definition
omits reference to the ""average ratc.,,70
TCEQ does not regulate malfunction emissions. Rather, TCEQ is in the process of
authorizing maintenance, startup and shutdown (MSS) emissions for chemical plants. Under
TCEQ's rules, baseline actual emissions include emissions events or emissions historically
exem pted under 30 TAC Chapter 101 to the extent they have been authorized or are being
authorized."" These emissions include MSS emissions to the extent they are verifiable. MSS
emissions that are not verifiable are treated as unauthorized and have a baseline emissions
rate of zero. Therefore, it appears that in this regard, the state's program is at least as
stringent as the federal program.

The rate TCEQ uses to determine baseline actual emissions is not inconsistent with federal
rules simply because the term ""average"" is omitted. A complete reading of the Texas rules
reveals that an average emission rate is being used to determine the baseline actual emission
ratc.72
•
EPA statcs that the definition of the term ""facility"" is not clcar.73
Specifically, EPA notes that ""[t]he submitted NNSR non-PAL rules do not explicitly limit
the definition of 'facility' to an 'emissions unit' as do the submitted PSD non-PAL rulcs.74
Under the state's statutes and rules, the term ""facility"" is defined as ""a discrete or identifiable
structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure that constitutes or contains a stationary
source, including appurtenances other than emission control equipment. A mine, quarry,
well test or road is not considered to be a facility.':"" The definition of""facility"" is so broad
that is requires every possible source of air contaminants to obtain some type of approva l
from TCEQ.
Under the state's definitions for the Title V Federal Operating Program, the state similarly
defines the term ""emissions unit"" as ""a discrete or identifiable structure, device, item,
equipment, or enclosure that constitutes or contains a point of origin of air pollutants,
including appurtenanccs.?"" Thus, the term ""facility"" is equivalent to the term ""emissions
unit.""
•
Finally, EPA expressed concerns with the statc's Standard Permit for PCPs.
Specifically, EPA states that the PCP Standard Permit is not limited in its applicability
to a single category of industrial sources, but to a broad class of pollution control
teehniqucs at all source categories. According to EPA, an individual Standard Permit
must be limited to a single source category.
I~PA also expresses its concern that thc
rules allow for the TCEQ Executive Director to exercise his discretion in making case-
specific determinations in individual cases in lieu of generic enforceable requirements.""
The Standard Permit is a minor NSR permitting too!' Similar to all other minor NSR
permitting programs, the state has wide discretion in its implementation ofthe program.

17

There is no federal requirement that limits the usc of a Standard Permit to a single source
category.
The only statute that governs EPA approval of the Standard Permit as a SIP
revision is the following general obligation under the federal Clean Air Act:
""Each [SIP] shall - ...

of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as necessary to assure that
national ambient air quality standards are achieved, including a permit program as

EPA docs not and cannot question that TCEQ's minor NSR program, including the Standard
Permit for PCPs, provides for the regulation of any stationary source as necessary to assure
that the NAAQ S arc achieved. Furthermore, Parts C (PSD) and D (nonattairunent NSR) are
not implicated because PCP Standard Permits are expressly made unavailable to the major
sources and major modifications that are subject to Parts C and D. Finally, there is also no
EPA rule that governs approvable Standard Permits. EPA's proposed disapproval fails to
identify a plausible reason why the PCP Standard Permit fails to meet federal requirements.
Moreover, the discretion provided to the TCEQ Executive Director under the state's rules is
intended to provide the Executive Director the flexibility to refuse to authorize a Standard
Permit in those cases where he determines there are health effects concerns or the potential to
exceed the NAAQS.79 The discretion granted the Executive Director in this respect is an
important permitting tool that is necessary to effectively protect the environment and is not a
sound basis for disapproval of this minor NSR permitting tool.
IV. QUALIFIEO FACILITIES
Finally, EPA has proposed to disapprove revisions to the SIP submitted by TCEQ that relate to
the Modification of Existing Qualified Facilities because the Program does not meet the NSR
SIP requirements nor does it meet the NSR SIP requirements for a substitute Major NSR SIP
revision. EPA also expresses general concern that it is not clear that the Qualified Facilities
Program is intended to apply only to minor sources,
TCC supports full approval ofthe Texas Qualified Facilities Program. Similar to the Flexible
Permits Program, the Qualified Facilities Program is not intended to shield a source from major

NSR permitting requirements. Similar to the Flexible Permits Program, the Qualified Facilities
Program is a robust, federally enforceable program. Authorized by the Texas Clean Air Aet,80
the state's Qualified Facilities Program promotes flexibility and allows sources to make certain
types of changes without triggering federal NSR permitting requirements. If federal NSR is
triggered, a facility cannot be a qualified facility. The definition of a qualified facility makes it
clear that a qualified facility is an existing facility."" Under TCEQ's rules, a qualified facility
may make a physical change in or change the operation of that facility as long as the change does
not result in a net increase in allowable emissions of any air contaminant and does not result in
the emission of any air contaminant not previously emitted. Additionally, the facility must be
using equipment at least as effect ive as the BACT required by the commission.V
EPA outlined the following concerns with the state's Qualified Facilities Program, and TCC's
responses follow:
•
EPA states that the Qualified Facilities Program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR,
the Program has no regulatory provisions clearly prohibiting the use of the Program to
circumvent the Major NSR SIP requirements, and the Program docs not require that
first an applicability determination must be made whether the construction or
modification is subject to Major NSn,83
TCC views this criticism as lacking merit. The Qualified Facilities Program is a minor NSR
program, TCEQ 's rules clearly require sources making changes under the Program to submi t
specific documentation, includi ng ""sufficient information as necessary to show that the
project will comply with §116.150 and §116.151 of this title (relating to Nonattainmen t
Review) and §§116.160-116.163 of this title (relating to Prevention of Significant
Deterioration Review) and with Subchapter C of this chapter (relating to Hazardous Air
Pollutants: Regulations Govern ing Constructed or Reconstructed Major Sources (FCAA
§11 2(g), 40 CFR Part 63)).,,84 Furthermore, TCEQ's rules also state that nothing in the rules
governing the Program shall limit the applicability of any federal requirement.""

•
In th e proposal, EPA requests comment on ""whether its understanding of Texas law is
correct for the definition of 'facility."" ,86
Accordi ng to EPA, ""the State uses a 'dual definition' for the term 'facility.' It is our
understanding of State law, that a 'facility' can be an 'emissions unit,' i.e., any part ofa
stationary source that emits or may have the potential to emit any air contaminant. A
'facility' also can be a piece of equipm ent, which is smaller than an 'emissions unit.' A
'facility' can be a 'major stationary source' as defined by Federal law. A 'facility' under
State law can be more than one 'major stationary source."",87
Under the state's statutes and rules, the term ""facility"" is defined as ""a discrete or identifiable
structure , device, item, equipment, or enclosure that constitutes or contains a statio nary
source, including appurtenances other than emission control equipment. A mine, quarry,
well test or road is not considered to be a faeility.,,88 The definition of ""facility"" is so broad
that is requires every possible source of air contaminants to obtain some type of approva l
from TCEQ.
Under the state's definitions for the Title V Federal Operating Program, the state similarly
defines the term ""emissions unit"" as ""a discrete or identifiable structure, device , item,
equipment, or enclosure that constitutes or contains a point of origin of air pollutants,
including appurtenances.t'f"" Thus, the term ""facility"" is equivalent to the term ""emissions
unit"" for purposes of the Qualified Facilities Program.
•
EPA criticizes the Qualified Facilities Program because it docs not include a
requirement to make Major NSR applicability determinations based on actual
emissions and on emissions increases and decreases (netting) that occur within a major
stationary source.90
TCEQ's rules state that in order to make a change at a qualified facility, the owner or
operator must demonstrate that the change does not result in a net increase in allowable
emissions of any air contaminant previously authorized under state minor source review.""

change qualification.Y Furthermore, the rules state that the existing level ofcont rol may not
bc lessened for a qualified facility.93 The program is not circumventing any federal
requirements for major stationary sources.
•
Under the Qnalified Facilities Program, EPA also proposes to disapprove the definition
ofIlACT.94
EPA states that ""the State PSO SIP must both require BACT and apply the federal definition
of BACT (or one that is more stringent) to be approved.t'"" In a recent letter to EPA, Mr.
Vickery committed to EPA that TC EQ will address the defin ition of BACT through an
upcom ing rulemaking.f"" Although TCC believes that the state's application of BACT is
consistent with federal requirements as explained in detail below, we support this TCEQ
initiative to update the definition of BACT. That said, any future changes in the BACT
definition should apply pros pectively and should have no effect on existing permits.
EPA's proposal to disapprove this rule is based in part on false distinctions between what it
refers to as ""PSO BACT"" and ""Minor NSR BACT."" Assuming such distinctions, EPA
concludes that the Texas rules fail to clearly apply the ""PSO definition of BACT"" to all
actions subject to PSO, and conversely fails to delimit the minor NSR definition to activitie s
triggering only minor NSR. But there are no distinctions, legal or practical, in Texas BACT
reviews,
Texas law does not create two different types ofpennits, one called a minor NSR permit and
one called a PSO permit. There is only one kind of pre-construction permit descri bed in the
Texas Clea n Air Act, a ""preconstruction permit"" under Texas Health & Safety Code §
382.0518. The issuance of all such permits is conditioned on use of ""best available control
technology"":
""(b) The commission shall grant within a reasonable time a permit or permit amendment
to construct or modify a facility if, from the information avail able to the commission,
including information presented at any hearing held under Section 382.056(k), the
commission finds:
(I) the proposed facility for which a perm it, permit amendment, or a special
permit is sought will use at least the best available control technology,

considering the technical practicability and economic reasonableness ofreducing
or eliminating the emissions resulting from the facility; and
(2) no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene the intent of
this chapter, including protection of the public's health and physical propcrty.'.97
One can search the entire Texas Clean Air Act- which is the sole authority under which
TCEQ can issue any permits-and find no mention of PSD at all; again, the governing law
establishes the need for BACT for all permits, major or minor. And the governing statute
does not define BACT beyond its own terms, leaving substantial degrees of freedom for
TCEQ to compel the best available control technology. TCEQ's implementing rules also do
not further define BACT at all, either, other than to emphasize the need for giving
""consideration ... to the technical practicability and the economic reasonableness of reducing
or eliminating emissions from the facility.',98
Texas accom plishes the PSD reviews required by Part C of Subtitle I of the federal Clean Air
Act by including various applicability provisions in its rules, but the only effect of
""triggering"" PSD review is to require an increment analysis (the ""significant deterioration""
review) for all preconstruction permits for PSD projects. Again, BACT reviews are
universal, and do not depend on triggering PSD. (This is one of the great strengths of
Texas's permitting program, not a weakness). The nature of the BACT review doesn't
change depending on whether the application triggers PSD: TCEQ determines BACT using
its 3-tiered process regardless of the size of project under review.
EPA is conditioning its approval on TCEQ adoption ofprecisely the same definition of
BACT that EPA has chosen. But EPA has no foundation for that condition as further
outlined in the five following points.
1. EPA May not Condition Approval of Texas's Permitting Programs on Adherence
to Specific Definitions
SIP approval of a PSD program is conditioned on accomplishing some very general statutory
objectives, as outlined in Section I65(a) of the federal Clean Air Act, including mechanisms
to ensure that each proposed major source or modification is subject to the best available
control technology.f"" Congress expressly left the particulars to each state.100 Not even

definitions: Variations are allowed ""if the State specifically demonstrates that the submitted
definition is more stringent, or at least as stringent, in all respects"" as those adopted by
EPA.10I TCEQ of course has made that demonstration in its various SIP submittals over the
years, but mostly by decades of actual BACT determinations made pursuant to its definition.
EPA has not identified even one TCEQ BACT determination that yielded an inadequate
result because of the different definitions.
In fact, EPA has agreed that the TCEQ BACT review process is perfeetly adequate. When
EPA granted Texas's PSD program complete SIP approval iu 1992, EPA accepted complete
exclusion of the federa l control technology review provisions (codified at 40 CFR 52.2 10)):
""[Bjecause the [Texas Air Control Board] claimed that the Texas Clean Air Act and the
existing State regulations have provisions for application of BACT as stringent as the
Federal requirements in reviewing the permit applications. The EPA review of the Texas
Clean Air Act and Regulation VI (Sections I l6.3(a)(3) through 116.3(a)(5)) have indeed

The final rule approving the Texas PSD program affirmed that incorporation of the federal

2. Definitions Do Not Determine Stri ngency
The stringency of BACT determinations are not determined by definitions, anyway. Even
the far wordier ""federal definition"" is but a litany of factors that go into what is inevitably a
highly discretion-laden determination. A more ""specific"" definition, it may truly be argued,
has the effect of being less stringent, because it limits the factors to be considered. Absent a
definition of BACT beyond its own self-description, TCEQ is free to be even stricter than the
wordier federal definition. Again, the proposed disapproval fails to identify even one
determination that (a) depeuded on the definition applied, and (b) yielded a determination
less strict than would resulted from application of the ""federal definition.""

3. EPA Itself Docs Not Follow the ""Federal Definition""
EPA is in a diffi cult position to insist on word-for-word adoption when it does not itself
follow the federal definition. The definition EPA would impose on the states is not the one
that Congress prescribes. The following shows the changes needed to the EPA rule in order
to conform it to the statute:
(12) Best available control technology means an emissions limitation (including a visible
emi ssion standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each pollutant subject
to regulation under Act which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary
source or major modification which the Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, taking
into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is
achievable for such source or modification through application of production processes 0 1'
available methods, systems, and techniques , including fuel cleaning 01' treatment 01'
innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall
application of best available control technology result in emissions of any pollutant which
would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CrR parts 60
and 61. If the Administrator determines that technological 01' ceonomic limitations on the
appl ication of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the
imposition of an emissions standard infeasible. ia design, equipment, work practice,
operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the
requirement for the application of best available control technology. Such standard shall,
to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of
such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by
means which achieve equivalent results.
Which federal definition would EPA like Texas to follow, the one in its rule 01' the one in its
governing statute? In what way does either ""federal definition"" necessarily requi re BACT
determinations any more strict than the Texas definition?
4. The Proposed Disapproval Draws on Distinctions W ithout Differences
The definition is designed to identify relevant factors that go into what is ultimately a highly
discretion-laden determination.
No matter the definition , the objective is the same. And no
matter the definitions, the resources consulted for each BACT determination are the same. In
Texas, for example, all BACT determinations are made using its 3-tier process, which
elaborates in detail how TCEQ makes the determinations. All reviews are based on
consideration of national determinations codified in the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse.
EPA has agreed that this process yields results equivalent to its top-down approach, which
24

itself is not compelled by any definition. In both cases, responsible agencies make
discretionary determinations based on aggressive efforts to ensure that new technologies arc
applied when they become available to new sources. Pharisaical parsing over definitions
docs not accomplish sound BACT determinations, which instead result from good faith
efforts by responsible regulators.
S. To the Very Extent There Were Differences in Result Based on Definition, EPA
Would bc Prohibited from Disapproving the Definition
EPA presumes without proof a difference in result arising out ofTCEQ 's BACT definition.
But, regardle ss, EPA cannot elect to approve the broader reach of the Texas program (e.g.,
application of BACT to all sources), but disapprove what it perceives to be a lesser definition
of BACT. States are the primary architects of their implementation plans, and EPA is not
free to change the state's choices by selective approvals of interrelated elements,104
Accordingly, the extent to which EPA would make any substantive changes in TCEQ's
permitting program by selectively disapproving its BACT definition is the very extent to
which it is forbidden to disapprove it. EPA must either accept the permit program or reject it
in its entirety, and not cut it to pieces so that it looks like a ransom note.
101 An unbroken line of cases, starting with Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Gorsuch, 742 F.2d 1028 (7th Cir. 1984), holds
. that the Clean Air Act, placing in the states the ""primary responsibility"" for protecting air quality, does not allow
EPA change the stringency of the plan as developed by the state; EPA may only approve or disapprove what the
state submits. In one case rejecting EPA 's decision to approve a sulfur dioxide limit but not the avera ging
conventions that wer e part of the rule, Judge Posner offered words that counsels against using the StP machete with
which EPA proposes to hack apart Texas's air quality permitting program:
... nothin g in the Act or in any cases we have found suggests that the EPA, when asked to
approve a revised plan , can, without pausing to decide whether a limitation in the plan that its
authors may have thought critical to its soun dness has any merit at all, approve the plan minu s
the limitation. Th e plan might be vastly better with than without the limitation, and the age ncy
cannot determine that without examining the limitation. Eve n if it is not vastly better, section
t 10(a)(3)(A) requires the Administrator to approve a revised plan , limitations and all, if he
determines that it meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act; and he cannot make that
determination if he refuses to evaluate the limitations.
Indiana & Michigan Electric Co. v. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 733 F.2d 489 , 49 1 (7th Cir.
1984); see also Concerned Citizens ofBridesburg v. EPA, 836 F.2d 777, 781 (3d Cir. 1987) (""Beeause the states
have primary responsibility for achieving air quality standards, the EPA has limited authority to reject a SIP."").

•
EPA proposes to approve the definitions of ""grandfuthered facility,"" ""maximum
allowable emissions ratc table,"" and ""ncw facility.""I05
TCC supports EPA's approval of these definitions in the Texas rules.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, TCC supports full EPA approval of the Texas Flexible Permits Program, the
Texas Qualified Facilities Program and the SIP submittals related to NSR Reform. The SIP
revisions submitted to EPA by TCEQ over the last 15 years serve as a critical component to a
robust and legally-enforceable Texas air permitting program. Texas should not be punished for
EPA's failure to uphold its legal obligation to evaluate and approve the state's SIP revision
submittals within the statutory period outlined in the federal Clean Air Act. Throughout the
proposed disapprovals, EPA offers little or no legally justifiable reason to disapprove these
Texas air permitting programs. This is unfortunate given the enormity of EPA's proposed action
and the impact that it will have on this country's largest industrial state. The SIP revision
submittals related to these programs are at least as stringent as the applicable federal
requirements and should be fully approved.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held
respo~sible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
Think and discuss future generations.
Your efforts are highly
appreciated.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) is broken.
I
applaud EPA1s proposed rUlins that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules ,do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
The time has come to chart a wise energy course.
We can no longer look
to coal for our needs.
Burning coal endangers Texans and adds to
climate destabilization.
The hidden costs of coal have now been
revealed.
We must look forward,
toward innovative clean energy that
boosts economic growth,
creates jobs and protects our health.
Regulations with real teeth are needed.
The TCEQ must end it's illegal
permitting.
I urge the EPA to put rules in place to reduce global
warming emissions and to make sure that any new laws do not allow
existing coal plants to continue to belch out dangerous pollutants and
global warming gases.
Sincerely,
Mr.
Mark Coats

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.  Texans deserve better.  We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.  Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.  Texans deserve better.  We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.  Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.

CHAPTER 5:  WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE 
 
5.1  QUANTITATIVE CORROBORATIVE ANALYSIS 
5.1.1  Introduction 
The corroborative analysis presented in this chapter demonstrates the progress that the Houston-
Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area is making towards attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 0.08 parts per million (ppm).  The United States 
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) April 2007 “Guidance on the Use of Models and Other 
Analyses for Demonstrating Attainment of Air Quality Goals for Ozone, PM2.5, and Regional Haze” 
(EPA, 2007) states that all model attainment demonstrations should include supplemental evidence that 
the conclusions derived from the basic attainment modeling are supported by other independent sources 
of information.  This document will present the supplemental evidence, i.e., the corroborative analyses, 
for the current modeling demonstration.  The guidance also states that a weight of evidence demonstration 
is allowed when the future design value is at or below 87.9 parts per billion (ppb). 
 
The first section of the quantitative corroborative analysis will discuss photochemical grid modeling.  
Modeling is one of the most important tools available for evaluating progress toward meeting air quality 
standards, but it is not a perfect tool.  The first section will also discuss known issues with photochemical 
grid modeling and how the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has dealt with them.  It 
also discusses overall model performance.  Finally, it discusses the diagnostic analyses performed by the 
TCEQ, and the implications of those analyses on the projected attainment status.  The second section of 
the quantitative corroborative analysis will discuss trends in ozone and ozone precursors observed in the 
HGB area, and examines the possible causes for those trends.  The third section describes air quality 
control measures that cannot yet be adequately quantified but are nonetheless expected to yield tangible 
air quality benefits.  
 
5.2  Corroborative Analysis:  Modeling 
Photochemical grid modeling of the HGB area is challenging, due to complex coastal wind circulation, 
complex petrochemical point sources of emissions in Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, and Harris 
Counties, and the challenges associated with modeling a metropolitan area of over five million 
inhabitants.   
 
One purpose of the Texas Air Quality Study 2000 (TexAQS 2000) and the Texas Air Quality Study 2006 
(TexAQS II) field studies was to address the uncertainties that affect photochemical grid modeling and 
their regulatory applications.  Insights gleaned from the TexAQS 2000 and subsequent studies have 
helped resolve some of these uncertainties.   
 
Several studies have tried to identify and reduce uncertainties in the HGB photochemical grid modeling.  
Foremost among these efforts are the studies that have sought to quantify underreported industrial highly 
reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) emissions (Wert et al., 2003; Xie and Berkowitz, 2007; 
Yarwood et al., 2004; TCEQ, 2002, 2004, 2006; Smith and Jarvie, 2008) and to assess the sensitivities of 
ozone simulations to underreporting these emissions (TCEQ, 2002, 2004, 2006; Byun et al., 2007; Jiang 
and Fast, 2004).  Other modeling efforts have tested different chemical mechanisms in the HGB area’s 
photochemical grid modeling, to study the effects of using different mechanisms on ozone model 
performance and control strategy effectiveness (Byun et al., 2005b; Faraji et al., 2008; Czader et al., 
2008).  Modeling sensitivity studies have also been performed to guide selection of model parameters 
such as vertical mixing schemes, number and depth of model layers, and horizontal grid resolution 
(Kemball-Cook et al., 2005; Byun et al., 2005b; Byun et al., 2007; Bao et al., 2005).   
 
 
 

 
 
5-2
Some of the most important findings of these studies include the following. 
 
• 
Emissions inventories must be reconciled to some extent with observational data before the 
model can accurately depict the ozone formation processes in the HGB area, especially for 
HRVOC. 
• 
Adding HRVOC to modeling emissions inventories generally increases ozone concentrations and 
alleviates a portion of the ozone and HRVOC under-prediction problems found by every 
modeling group who has attempted to model the HGB area. 
• 
Reactivities of the TCEQ-defined HRVOC are high regardless of which chemical mechanism is 
used to evaluate their effects.  In addition to the TCEQ list of HRVOC, formaldehyde also 
displays high reactivity. 
 
Mesoscale meteorological modeling is used to drive photochemical grid models, and many studies have 
examined and reduced uncertainties in these models as well.  One of the most successful efforts improved 
meteorological simulations of ozone episodes by using radar profiler and other upper level wind data to 
“nudge” the meteorological modeling (Nielsen-Gammon et al., 2007; Zhang et al. 2007; Stuart et al., 
2007; Bao et al., 2005; Fast et al., 2006).  Other efforts improved land cover data and land surface 
modeling (Byun et al., 2005a; Cheng et al., 2008a, 2008b) and studied the sensitivity of ozone simulations 
to solar irradiance and photolysis rates (Zamora et al., 2005; Fast et al., 2006; Pour-Biazar et al., 2007; 
Byun et al., 2007; Koo et al., 2008). 
 
Some of the most important findings of these meteorological modeling studies include the following. 
 
• 
Assimilation of radar profiler and other upper air wind data is essential to good meteorological 
modeling performance in the HGB area. 
• 
Modeling parameterizations need to be chosen carefully to alleviate the common problem of 
spurious thunderstorms and clouds. 
• 
Accurate simulation of cloud cover is crucial to getting photolysis rates correct in the 
photochemical grid model, and ozone predictions are very sensitive to photolysis rates. 
• 
An ensemble approach to meteorological and photochemical grid modeling may be warranted, 
given the sensitivity of ozone modeling to relatively small changes in meteorology.  The 
ensemble approach will allow probabilistic attainment demonstrations to be produced. 
 
In the remainder of this section, modeling issues identified by the studies described above will be 
discussed, as well as issues raised by TexAQS 2000 research, by TexAQS II research, and by TCEQ-
sponsored investigations.  Overall performance of the photochemical grid modeling and the implications 
of the model’s ability to accurately simulate ozone episodes will also be discussed.  Finally, additional 
metrics that show the effects of the proposed control strategies on ozone in the HGB area will be 
presented. 
 
5.2.1  Solving Modeling Problems 
For the HGB area, there are several aspects of ozone modeling that require special attention, due to their 
role in current or historical shortcomings in model performance.  This section discusses some of these 
issues, and how TCEQ has attempted to resolve them in this round of modeling. 
 
5.2.1.1  Industrial Point Source Emission Inventory Issues  
High concentrations of light alkenes such as propylene, ethylene, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes have been 
observed in the HGB metropolitan area, and are closely associated with petrochemical industry facilities 
in eastern Harris, Galveston, Chambers, and Brazoria Counties (Ryerson et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2003; 
Daum et al., 2004; Berkowitz et al., 2004; Berkowitz et al., 2005; Kleinman et al., 2002; Kleinman et al., 
2005; Jobson et al., 2004; Karl et al., 2003; Buzcu and Fraser, 2006; Xie and Berkowitz, 2006, 2007; Kim 
et al., 2005).  These compounds have been identified as highly reactive, and they play a major role in 
forming the highest concentrations of ozone observed in the HGB area (Ryerson et al., 2003; Daum et al., 
2003, 2004; Kleinman et al., 2002, 2005; Wert et al., 2003; Czader et al., 2008).  Historical analyses of 
routinely collected volatile organic compounds (VOC) data indicate that these compounds are present in 

 
 
5-3
high concentrations on a routine basis in the HGB area (Hafner Main et al., 2001; Estes et al., 2002; 
Brown and Hafner Main, 2002; Brown et al., 2002; Hafner and Brown, 2003; Jolly et al., 2003; Fang and 
McDowell, 2003; Jolly, 2003; Kim et al., 2005; Buzcu and Fraser, 2006; Xie and Berkowitz, 2006, 2007).  
Consequently, the high HRVOC concentrations observed during the two field study periods in 2000 and 
2006 are not anomalously large, and the conclusions drawn from those data should be generally 
applicable to the HGB area.  
 
Both field studies sponsored by the TCEQ, TexAQS 2000 and TexAQS II, have indicated that there are 
substantial discrepancies in the reported emissions of HRVOC, especially ethene and propylene (Ryerson 
et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2004; Wert et al., 2003; Gilman et al., 2009; de Gouw et al., 
2009).  The TCEQ remote sensing studies of flares, storage tanks, cooling towers, and other sources have 
shown that large quantities of VOC emissions have gone unreported (Robinson et al., 2008; Smylie et al., 
2004).  In addition, solar occultation flux measurements have shown that 30-minute variations in 
industrial HRVOC emissions can be an order of magnitude or more (Mellqvist et al., 2007, 2008).   
 
In an attempt to better quantify underreported HRVOC for purposes of photochemical grid modeling, the 
TCEQ commissioned a study by researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Xie and 
Berkowitz, 2006, 2007).  The researchers used historical HRVOC measurements from the extensive 
automated gas chromatograph network currently in place in the industrial areas of the HGB area.  Most of 
the sites in this network went into operation during 2003.  Using trajectories to link the source areas to the 
observations, the researchers were able to estimate which areas had the greatest emissions relative to other 
areas.   
 
For the current round of modeling, TCEQ researchers extended the methods developed by Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory to quantitatively estimate underreported HRVOC emissions in the HGB 
area.  The Potential Source Contribution Function method has measurably improved model performance 
for ozone and its precursors by reconciling the industrial point source emissions inventory with observed 
HRVOC concentrations during 2005-2006 (Smith and Jarvie, 2008).  This method does not attempt to 
reproduce the temporal variations in emissions, but instead calculates a median rate of emission for each 
square kilometer of the HGB area.  Since two years of data are used to estimate the medians, the metric is 
statistically robust.   
 
5.2.1.2  Modeling of Emissions Events 
Attempts have been made to quantify temporal variations in industrial point source emissions by 
accessing emission event reports that are delivered by industry to the TCEQ (Murphy and Allen, 2005).  
Problems with the event report data include the following. 
 
• 
Emission events were self-reported by industry, and the quantities of emissions reported were not 
independently observed or verified.  Facilities are allowed, by rule, to estimate emissions during 
emergency releases due to safety concerns. 
• 
Emission events were only reported if estimated emissions were greater than a certain threshold 
above the permitted emission level.  Some facilities have very large permitted emissions levels, and 
therefore large fluctuations in emissions may occur under an authorized emission rate that are not 
included in the data set.  Consequently, the frequency and magnitude of emission events in this data 
set does not reflect the actual magnitudes or frequency of emission events. 
• 
Emission event data for the Murphy and Allen study were collected before industry was required to 
monitor HRVOC.  Therefore, most of the emission estimates are not based upon measurements of 
the events. 
• 
The TCEQ infrared camera studies have found numerous instances where emissions were 
emanating from locations that were not included in any emissions inventory. 
• 
The TCEQ flare investigations have found that flares are typically managed to reduce noise, smoke, 
and glare.  Optimizing the flare to keep destruction efficiency at a maximum is a secondary 
consideration.  In particular, flares used as both emergency flares and process flares have been 
observed to operate with poor combustion efficiency when operating in process flare mode 
(Robinson et al., 2008).   

 
 
5-4
• 
In addition, flare monitoring records only the chemicals flowing to the flare, not which species are 
actually being emitted.  Combustion efficiencies are estimates of how much of the original material 
has been destroyed, and no effort is made to estimate the composition or reactivity of the 
combustion products.  Circumstantial evidence from the TexAQS II and from the Study of Houston 
Atmospheric Radical Precursors (SHARP) suggests that formaldehyde may be produced during 
flare combustion, though the absolute quantity of emissions may only constitute a small part of the 
observed ambient formaldehyde (Gilman et al., 2009; De Gouw et al., 2009).  The SHARP field 
campaign in April-May 2009 is investigating this hypothesis in greater depth. 
• 
Field studies (Mellqvist et al., 2007, 2008; de Gouw et al., 2009) and recent infrared camera and 
differential absorption lidar (DIAL) results (Robinson et al., 2008) show that the techniques used by 
industry to estimate HRVOC point source emissions are still inadequate to quantify them properly, 
because these experiments measured much higher emission fluxes than were reported. 
 
A number of recent modeling studies have attempted to investigate the frequency, magnitude, and impact 
of emission events upon ozone in Houston (Webster et al., 2007; Nam et al., 2006, 2008). Since these 
studies are based upon the emission event reports, they have not properly quantified the frequency or 
magnitude of the emission events, due to the problems discussed above.  Therefore, the modeled impact 
of emission events described in the Webster et al. and Nam et al. studies are unlikely to accurately reflect 
the complete impact of emission events in the HGB area.  Since the acquisition of properly quantified 
emissions for all industrial emission events that occur in the HGB area appears to be far in the future, the 
TCEQ has not attempted to speculate on the exact frequency or magnitude of sporadic emission events in 
this modeling exercise. 
 
5.2.1.3  Resolution of Photochemical Modeling Grids   
Numerous studies have investigated the effects of grid size on model behavior (Cohan et al., 2006; Esler, 
2003; Gego et al., 2005; Valari and Menut, 2008).  The main interest in finer grid resolution is that higher 
resolution can increase concentrations of ozone precursors in narrow plumes, which can affect ozone 
production rate and sensitivity to VOC or nitrogen oxides (NOX) within the plumes.  In a city such as 
Houston, using a higher resolution grid is sensible, given the abundance of industrial point sources, which 
can generate narrow plumes.  Researchers during TexAQS 2000 determined that rapid ozone formation 
occurring within narrow industrial plumes are responsible for the highest observed ozone in the HGB 
area, and for the strong ozone gradients that can form.  Strong ozone gradients can cause large increases 
in ozone concentration at monitoring sites as the plume is carried across town by winds that have shifted 
direction and are no longer parallel to the plumes.  To resolve these atmospheric features, the TCEQ is 
using smaller-sized grid cells than previous modeling exercises (2 kilometer (km) × 2 km instead of 4 km 
× 4 km).  In general, the TCEQ has found that smaller grid sizes can yield higher ozone production and 
can alleviate, in part, the commonly observed low bias for ozone within industrial plumes.  There are 
limits to this solution, however; it is inappropriate to decrease grid size indefinitely.  Parameterizations in 
both the meteorological modeling and the photochemical grid modeling are based upon the assumption 
that turbulence features within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) are much smaller than the grid size.  If 
the grid size is decreased to 1 km × 1km or lower, the assumption probably no longer holds, and more 
uncertainty can be added to the modeling as a result of the finer resolution.  If smaller grid sizes are 
desired, large eddy simulation modeling should be considered rather than photochemical grid modeling.   
 
Also, note that if the spatial resolution of the photochemical grid modeling is reduced, then the temporal 
resolution of the meteorological and chemical processes within the model ought to be reduced, to match 
the shorter residence time of precursors in each grid cell. In other words, as the size of the box shrinks, 
the amount of time that a mass of air resides in the box also shrinks, affecting how the ozone chemistry 
plays out.  While the Comprehensive Air Model with Extensions (CAMx) automatically adjusts the time 
step for chemical processes, the meteorological process time step is fixed, based upon the input data from 
the Fifth Generation Meteorological Model (MM5).  While it is possible to extract meteorological output 
with higher temporal resolution, reduction of the time steps seems likely to cause unusual model 
behavior.  The reduction of time steps in regulatory photochemical grid modeling has not been well 
studied.  In the future, it may be desirable to use grid sizes smaller than 2 km, and shorter time steps, but 
for now, TCEQ will refrain from experimenting with finer resolutions.  For this round of modeling, the 

 
 
5-5
TCEQ has reduced the size of the CAMx modeling grid cells from 4 km to 2 km through flexi-nesting, 
but has kept the size of the MM5 modeling grid cells at 4 km.   
 
5.2.1.4  Incommensurability and Model Performance Evaluation   
Swall and Foley (2009) discuss the problems inherent in comparing point measurements to grid cell 
values.  In statistical parlance, this problem is known as incommensurability.  A portion of the difference 
between point measurements and grid cell values is due solely to the fact that measurements made at a 
monitoring station do not generally represent an average of the conditions for the 2 km × 2 km grid cell in 
which it resides.  The ability of a point measurement to represent the average of the entire grid cell area is 
related to how much sub-grid variation is observed in the area.  If sub-grid variation is small, then the 
point measurement and the grid cell value are commensurate.  If the spatial gradients of the variables of 
interest are large, the point measurements are less able to reflect the average conditions of the entire grid 
cell, and therefore they are incommensurate with the grid cell value.   
 
HGB area ozone often has strong spatial gradients due to the rapid ozone formation within industrial 
source plumes.  In the HGB area, the worst ozone model performance is sometimes found in areas with 
the steepest ozone gradients, and the best ozone model performance is often found in areas further 
downwind, where the ozone gradients have lessened.  Swall and Foley demonstrated that 
incommensurability alone is capable of degrading model performance in areas of steep gradients.  They 
state in their discussion:  “This means that, even if the model is performing perfectly and there is no 
observational error, we cannot expect that in a scatterplot, points representing paired modeled and 
observed values will lie on a one-to-one line. Our comparison of Gaussian and exponential correlation 
structures with the same effective range shows that this concern looms larger for correlation structures in 
which there is a rapid decrease in correlation for small distances relative to grid cell size (like the 
exponential).”  While there are other causes of poor model performance as well, note that 
incommensurability is likely to be responsible for some of the differences between model output and 
point measurements.  
 
5.2.1.5  Ensemble Modeling   
A number of researchers have discussed the benefits of using ensembles of models to create more 
accurate forecasts (Pinder et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2007).  Pinder et al. and Zhang et al. have noted that 
probabilistic attainment demonstrations could be made using ensemble modeling and have argued that 
this approach can be more scientifically sound than a deterministic attainment demonstration.  The TCEQ 
acknowledges the potential soundness of the ensemble approach but notes that the current regulatory 
framework does not easily allow for a probabilistic attainment demonstration. 
 
5.2.1.6  Vertical Distribution of Ozone   
Ozonesonde measurements have been made each summer in the HGB area since 2003 (Morris et al., 
2006).  Findings from this study indicate that elevated free tropospheric ozone (i.e., above the PBL) in the 
HGB area is usually underestimated, and it often does not appear to mix down to the ground.  Ozone in 
the lowest layers of the atmosphere often shows much more structure than the model simulates.  The 
implication is that the model is mixing the lowest layers of the atmosphere more efficiently than they are 
actually mixing.  The TCEQ has attempted to address these two issues.  For the free tropospheric ozone, 
the TCEQ has obtained global model output for the appropriate time periods so that boundary conditions 
of free tropospheric ozone are more appropriate.  Some of the discrepancies still persist; they appear to be 
related to phenomena that occur between the outermost domain boundaries and the HGB area. .  For the 
PBL mixing issue, the TCEQ has improved the land cover data and sea surface temperature data in its 
latest round of modeling, in an attempt to improve the simulations of surface energy balance.  In addition, 
the TCEQ has chosen the Eta PBL scheme (i.e., the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic scheme), which appears to be 
more effective at simulating PBL dynamics in the coastal regions than other available schemes.  The 
TCEQ continues to investigate potential improvements for vertical mixing in the modeling. 
 
5.2.1.7  Photolysis Discrepancies Due to Improper Placement of Clouds   
Researchers at the University of Alabama-Huntsville performed a modeling study that examined the 
effects of modeled cloud cover on ozone performance in the HGB area, and found that some of the 

 
 
5-6
shortcomings in model performance could be corrected with better depiction of clouds (Pour-Biazar et al., 
2007).  University of Houston researchers also found that their forecasts were occasionally biased due to 
poor depiction of cloud cover (Byun et al., 2007).  TCEQ-funded research found that higher-order 
decoupled direct method analysis of modeling sensitivities indicated substantial sensitivity to photolysis 
rates (Koo et al., 2008). 
 
The TCEQ has found similar cloud cover effects in the photochemical modeling for this state 
implementation plan (SIP).  The greatest discrepancies tend to involve the model under-predicting cloud 
cover, and hence, greatly over-predicting ozone on low ozone days.  Modeled episode days for which 
cloud cover problems exist include:  May 28, 2005; June 17, 2005; July 31, 2005; Aug 5, 2005; May 31-
June 1, 2006; Aug 15, 2006; Aug 19, 2006; Aug 22, 2006; September 12, 2006; October 10, 2006.  The 
average mean normalized bias for these days is +34.6 percent, compared to an average mean normalized 
bias on exceedance days of +9.7 percent.  TCEQ process analysis shows that most of the radical 
initiation, propagation and termination steps are very sensitive to photolysis rates.  Hence, improvements 
in cloud placement could greatly improve ozone and precursor performance, though the greatest 
improvements will likely occur on low ozone days.   
 
To improve the cloud distribution, the TCEQ has followed the guidance of Texas A&M University 
(TAMU) researcher and state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon and has utilized the Grell cumulus 
parameterization, which reduces the amount of spurious thunderstorm formation in the HGB area.   
 
5.2.1.8  Radical Shortage   
A number of researchers studying urban photochemistry in the HGB area and other cities have found that 
available mechanisms for simulating radical production are unable to replicate the observed radical 
formation and propagation rates (Mao et al., 2007, 2009; Chen et al., 2009).  The process analysis section 
of Appendix I:  Corroborative Analysis for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP discusses this issue in 
detail and compares TCEQ process analyses to the Mao et al. and Chen et al. work.  The TCEQ modeling 
is consistent with the Mao et al. and Chen et al. findings that there is apparently something missing in the 
current mechanisms. The atmospheric chemistry community as a whole has not yet resolved the problem 
or problems with the current mechanisms.  Several hypotheses for the missing radical formation 
mechanism exist, including daytime nitrous acid (HONO) production from nitric acid-aerosol interactions 
and photolysis (Ziemba et al., 2009); isoprene production of hydroxyl radical (OH) (Lelieveld et al., 
2008; North and Ghosh, 2009); formation and decomposition of electronically excited nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2
*) (Li et al., 2008); nitryl chloride (ClNO2) chemistry (Osthoff et al., 2008; Simon et al., 2008); 
improved aromatic chemistry (Faraji et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2007); and molecular chlorine reactions 
(Chang et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2003; Chang and Allen, 2006; Sarwar and Bhave, 2007).  Given the 
manifold hypotheses and the current lack of a definitive explanation, the TCEQ has not incorporated 
modified chemical mechanisms into its base case modeling at this time.  However, the TCEQ continues to 
support investigations for improving chemical mechanisms, and is prepared to adopt an improved 
mechanism when it becomes sufficiently mature. 
 
5.2.2  Model Performance Evaluations:  Implications of the Model Performance of the Current SIP 
Modeling 
Model performance evaluation is presented in Chapter 3, Photochemical Modeling and in its associated 
appendices.  Appendix I:  Corroborative Analysis for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP includes 
two discussions of model performance in the Chemical Process Analysis and Intensive Model 
Performance sections.  In addition, Appendix I:  Corroborative Analysis for the HGB Attainment 
Demonstration SIP  includes a discussion of using 2005 baseline modeling to estimate future 2018 design 
values.  Based upon these evaluations, the following overall conclusions can be reached. 
 
Ozone performance  
• 
The model simulates the location, spatial extent, and relative intensity of ozone relatively well on 
most of the high-ozone days. 
• 
The model consistently underestimates peak ozone within the highest concentration plumes. 
• 
Simulated ozone depicts rapid morning ozone increases (30-50 ppb) relatively well, but tends to 

 
 
5-7
miss afternoon peak concentrations. 
• 
Radical and ozone precursor budgets were calculated directly from observations by Mao et al. 
(2009) at the Moody Tower during TexAQS II.  They observed that ozone formation in the HGB 
area is both VOC- and NOX-sensitive, with VOC-sensitive ozone formation usually occurring in 
the morning and NOX-sensitive formation occurring in the afternoon.  Based upon the TCEQ’s 
process analysis, the TCEQ modeling appears to be simulating the VOC- and NOX-sensitivity of 
ozone formation at Moody Tower relatively well, because the relative radical termination rates 
generally agree with the Mao et al. data. 
• 
Process analysis and modeling sensitivity analyses show that peak eight-hour ozone is primarily 
NOX-sensitive in much of the domain, but can be VOC-sensitive downwind of the urban core and 
the HGB industrial areas. 
• 
According to TCEQ process analyses, VOC-sensitive conditions occur more often and more 
strongly in the industrial and urban core plumes.  When ozone production is VOC-sensitive, 
usually more ozone is created than in NOX-sensitive conditions.  
• 
Chen et al. (2009) used the Moody Tower TexAQS II observations to constrain a steady-state 
photochemical box model.  They used the Carbon Bond 05 chemical mechanism and several 
other chemical mechanisms to simulate the chemistry with the box model.  They found that all of 
the chemical mechanisms underestimated peak daytime radical concentrations. The Carbon Bond 
05 mechanism used by the TCEQ in this modeling exercise is one of the better performing 
mechanisms, but it still doesn’t make enough radicals.  The shortfall in radical production may be 
related to the shortfall in ozone production rates observed in the photochemical grid modeling.  
Note, however, that the results from Chen et al. are based upon a constrained steady-state box 
model, which assumes that the chemical system is in a photochemical steady state.  It isn’t clear 
whether this assumption is valid all of the time in the HGB area.  
• 
Decreases in ozone production rates and other reaction rates correlate with decreases in NO2 
photolysis, implying that most of the ozone formation chemistry is highly sensitive to photolysis, 
and hence, highly sensitive to cloud-cover errors. 
• 
Background ozone concentrations are important in accurately simulating the modeling for the 
HGB area. For most of the modeled days, the background ozone is unlikely to bias the modeling 
results in the HGB area, but during the July-August 2005 episode, excessively high background 
concentrations seem to compromise the model performance. 
• 
In rural areas, the model routinely over-predicts nighttime ozone and under-predicts NOX.  The 
cause of this issue is unknown, but it could involve unreported NOX sources or problems with 
vertical mixing in rural areas. 
• 
Above the planetary boundary layer, the model sometimes underestimated ozone concentrations, 
especially in the springtime.  Usually the high ozone above the PBL was not being mixed 
downward, so that this error usually did not have much effect upon the ozone concentrations in 
the HGB area.   
• 
Transport and mixing of urban and industrial emissions within the HGB area can apparently 
affect the ozone chemistry substantially, especially when the urban core plume and the industrial 
plumes mix together.  Ozone behavior, including VOC- and NOX-sensitivity, appears to change 
when these plumes mix.  The implication is that the VOC- and NOX-sensitivity of ozone 
formation in the HGB area depend somewhat on the wind direction. 
• 
Since ozone was sometimes overestimated during the evening hours, the model did not display 
the amount of dynamic range present in the observations. 
 
Ozone precursor performance 
• 
In general, the modeling simulated ozone precursors relatively well, albeit with a large degree of 
scatter, and the peak concentrations for some species were underestimated. 
• 
NO2 was usually simulated in an unbiased manner, but nitric oxide (NO) was often 
underestimated for the peak concentrations, which were usually observed in the pre-dawn hours, 
i.e., during morning rush hour. 
• 
The highly reactive Carbon Bond 05 species ETH and OLE, which represent ethylene, propylene, 
and other alkenes, were well simulated much of the time, but the model tended to underestimate 

 
 
5-8
the peak concentrations.  Concentrations of these two species were routinely overestimated at the 
Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitoring site. 
• 
The performance of isoprene, represented by the Carbon Bond 05 species ISOP, was mixed, with 
some areas showing no bias, others showing high bias, and others showing low bias.   
• 
Formaldehyde data were available during the TexAQS II study at three sites.  For the Moody 
Tower site, the concentrations were usually well simulated, but the peak concentrations were 
underestimated.  For the Lynchburg Ferry (CAMS 1015) and HRM-3 Haden Road (CAMS 603) 
sites, the performance was mediocre.  The HRM-3 Haden Road (CAMS 603) observations were 
consistent with secondary formaldehyde formation as the main source of formaldehyde, but the 
diurnal patterns of the modeled concentrations were more consistent with a primary source:  
concentrations peaked in the pre-dawn hours, like NO.  The aircraft data generally show that the 
model underestimated formaldehyde peaks, though the location, extent, and relative magnitude 
were well simulated, much like the ozone data. 
 
Meteorological performance evaluation 
• 
The meteorological modeling was able to successfully replicate the major features of ozone 
episodes in the HGB area much of the time, including the typical veering pattern of local winds, 
stagnation and flow reversal, and the coastal oscillations associated with the Galveston Bay 
breeze and Gulf breeze. 
• 
Trajectory analyses and vertical wind profiles in the HGB area show that much of the time on 
high ozone days, the model transported ozone and precursors to approximately the correct areas 
at approximately the correct times. 
• 
The model occasionally did not generate enough cloud cover, resulting in high ozone on days 
when low ozone was observed.  While the addition of the Grell cumulus parameterization and 
improved land surface characteristics data appeared to reduce the common problem of spurious 
thunderstorms, the problem has not been completely eliminated. 
• 
Episode days with strong stagnation were more difficult to model precisely than days for which 
the winds did not stagnate.  The model sometimes simulated nighttime winds that were too brisk, 
resulting in more dilution of emissions than was actually observed. 
• 
Ozonesonde and radar profiler data indicate that for most episode days, the PBL over land 
appeared to be modeled with good accuracy.  Over water, however, planetary boundary layer 
depth was consistently modeled less accurately.   
 
Model response to emission changes 
• 
The base case modeling has been challenged with different emissions inventories in order to 
evaluate its dynamic response to emission changes (Gilliland et al., 2009). 
• 
Adding more VOC to the flare emissions increases peak ozone concentrations, though the 
emission changes do not completely correct the ozone underestimations.  Addition of 
formaldehyde emissions to HRVOC flares increases peak ozone concentrations further. 
• 
Substitution of flare emissions for the standard emission reconciliation tends to improve the 
model performance by increasing ozone production close to the industrial emission sources and 
by increasing the peak ozone concentrations, without adversely affecting ozone performance at 
other times and places. 
• 
Modeled ozone appears to decrease slightly in response to NOX emission decreases typical of the 
changes that occur on weekends.  The observed weekend effect is a slightly stronger response to 
NOX emission decreases, implying that the model may be slightly less NOX-sensitive than it 
should be. 
• 
Modeled ozone increases substantially in response to VOC and NOX emission increases 
commensurate with the difference between 2006 emissions and 2000 emissions in the HGB area.  
When relative response factors are calculated using 2000 as the baseline year and 2006 as the 
future year, the modeled response to emission reductions is less vigorous than the observed 
response.  This finding implies that the current modeling appears to underestimate the response to 
emission controls.  If the atmosphere responds to the emission reductions from 2006 to 2018 in a 
manner similar to its response to the emission reductions between 2000 and 2006, the actual 
decrease in ozone design value will be greater than the model predicts. 

 
 
5-9
• 
Some of the strongest model responses to emission changes occur outside the boundaries of the 
current ozone monitoring network, and sometimes outside the current nonattainment area.  This 
finding suggests that the proposed controls may have a greater impact on ozone than the 
responses registered at the different monitoring sites would indicate.   
 
5.2.3  Model Response to Proposed Controls:  Additional Ways to Measure Progress 
Table 5-1:  Changes in the Area and Population Affected by an Eight-Hour Ozone Design Value Greater 
than or Equal to 85 ppb in Response to Growth and Controls shows how the area affected by high ozone 
is expected to shrink dramatically in response to the emission changes projected to occur between 2006 
and 2018.  Even though peak ozone drops by only 8 percent, the area with an estimated ozone design 
value greater than the 85 ppb standard shrinks by 96 percent.  The population living in those areas and 
how the changes might reduce the number of people that encounter high ozone were considered.  The 
estimated number of people residing in the high ozone areas decreases by 92 percent.  Note that the 
population data is from the 2000 Census and has not been grown to reflect changes in population in those 
areas in 2006 or 2018.  Also note that the numbers reflect areas where people reside, i.e., their home 
addresses, not necessarily where they might be during the hours of highest ozone during the ozone season.  
However, the dramatic decrease in the area with high ozone suggests that ozone decreases arising from 
the proposed control strategies are likely to benefit many residents of the HGB area.

5.2.4  Conclusion  
The photochemical grid model performed by the TCEQ for this SIP revision has been rigorously 
evaluated against observational data.  While there are a number of shortcomings that this modeling has in 
common with other modeling exercises in the HGB area as discussed in Sections 5.2.1, Solving Modeling 
Problems, and 5.2.2, , Model Performance Evaluations:  Implications of the Model Performance of the 
Current SIP Modeling, modeling for many of the simulated ozone days appears to behave in a manner 
consistent with most of the atmospheric phenomena of interest.  Evaluation of the modeling response to 
emission changes appears to show that the modeled ozone is slightly less responsive to emission changes 
than the observed ozone.  Thus, modeling of 2018 emissions with the proposed control package in place 
may overpredict the future ozone concentrations. 
   
5.3  AIR QUALITY TRENDS IN THE HGB AREA 
This section describes analyses of air quality observational data in the HGB area.  Trends in ozone and its 
precursors demonstrate not only the substantial progress the HGB area has made in improving air quality 
but also the magnitude of the future challenge in attaining the ozone NAAQS.  Trends are also useful to 
show how ozone is related to its precursors.  Decreases in NOX and VOC demonstrate the effectiveness of 
policies to reduce emissions; however, due to its dependence on meteorological variables, ozone may not 
always exhibit trends identical to its precursors.  Separating variations in meteorological factors from 
trends in ozone and its precursors can highlight whether ozone reductions are due to decreases in 

 
 
5-10
precursor emissions or are due to year-to-year variability in local meteorology (Sullivan, 2009; Camalier, 
et al., 2007).   
 
5.3.1  Ozone Trends 
This section examines the frequency at which the NAAQS for ozone are exceeded, with the 
understanding that the 1997 eight-hour standard of 0.08 ppm is the subject of interest for this SIP revision 
and that the one-hour standard is no longer in effect, but still a useful benchmark for understanding ozone 
behavior in the HGB area.  While the NAAQS is expressed in units of ppm, this section will use the 
familiar convention of expressing concentrations in ppb.   
 
The trend in design values for the HGB area is seen clearly in Figure 5-1:  Ozone Design Values for the 
HGB Area.  While the HGB area continues to exceed both the one-hour and eight-hour ozone standards, 
one-hour ozone design values have generally decreased over the past 17 years, and eight-hour ozone 
design values have decreased over at least the past nine years.  The eight-hour ozone design value in 2008 
was 91 ppb, a 24 percent decrease from the 1991 design value of 119 ppb.  The 2008 value is approaching 
the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS of 85 ppb.  A regression analysis of design value on year estimates 
that eight-hour ozone design values decreased at the rate of 1.2 ppb per year, which is statistically 
significant at the 5 percent level (α = 0.05).  If this trend were to continue at that rate, attainment of the 
1997 eight-hour standard could be reached in five years, though if the pace of recent years were 
maintained, it could occur even sooner.

The one-hour ozone design value in 2008 was 147 ppb, a 33 percent decrease from the 1991 design value 
of 220 ppb.  Regression of one-hour design values on year shows they decreased at the rate of 3.6 ppb per 
year, which is faster than the decrease for eight-hour ozone design values; the slope is also statistically 
significant at the 5 percent level.

The design value in a metropolitan area is the highest design value of all of the area’s monitors’ 
individual design values.  Because ozone varies spatially, it is also prudent to investigate trends at 
all monitors in an area.  Table 5-2:  Eight-Hour Ozone Design Values (in ppb) for Each 
Regulatory Monitor in the HGB Area and Table 5-3:  One-Hour Ozone Design Values (in ppb) 
for Each Regulatory Monitor in the HGB Area contain the eight-hour and one-hour ozone design 
values at all regulatory monitors in the HGB area from 1991 to 2008.  More monitors than these 
operate in the HGB area, but because the data at those monitors do not meet the EPA’s quality 
control standards, the design values at those additional monitors are not displayed here.  These 
non-regulatory monitors are discussed in Section 5.2.2:  Model Performance Evaluations:  
Implications of the Model Performance of the Current SIP Modeling.

Note: Missing values indicate a monitor was not operating during that year or did not produce a valid year of data.  Only one year of valid data is required to calculate a one-hour ozone design value; therefore, some monitors 
that have a one-hour ozone design value may not have an eight-hour ozone design value.  

 
 
5-14
 
Figure 5-2:  Eight-Hour Ozone Design Value Statistics for All Monitors in the HGB Area and 
Figure 5-3: One-Hour Ozone Design Value Statistics for All Monitors in the HGB Area display 
three summary statistics for the eight-hour and one-hour design values, respectively:  the 
maximum, median, and minimum design values computed across all monitors in the HGB area.  
These figures facilitate assessment of the range of design values observed within a year, as well 
as how these distributions change over time.  From these figures, it appears that neither eight-
hour nor one-hour design values exhibited a noticeable trend until about 1999, after which both 
began falling steadily.  Before 2002, no monitors in the HGB area met either standard; since then, 
the area has seen a steady increase in the number of monitors attaining both standards.  By 2008, 
over half of the monitors in the area had attained both standards, as median ozone design values 
fell below the NAAQS that year.

Ozone trends can also be investigated by looking at the number of days an exceedance of the 
ozone NAAQS was recorded, termed an exceedance day.  An exceedance day for the 1997 eight-
hour ozone NAAQS is any day that any monitor in the area measures an eight-hour average 
ozone concentration greater than or equal to 85 ppb over any eight-hour period.  An exceedance 
day for the one-hour ozone NAAQS is any day that any monitor in the area measures a one-hour 
average ozone concentration greater than or equal to 125 ppb for at least one hour.  Previous 
research (Savanich, unpublished, 2006) by the TCEQ has shown that, until 2006, the number of 
exceedance days was positively correlated with the number of monitors in a particular area.  As 
the number of monitors increases, so does the number of exceedance days recorded, at least until 
the area has been saturated with monitors or until ozone concentrations truly decrease.  Because 
of this correlation, when examining exceedance-day trends, the number of monitors must always 
be considered.  Thus, it is especially noteworthy that Figure 5-4:  Number of Monitors and Ozone 
Exceedance Days in the HGB Area shows that, despite an increase in the number of monitors, the 
number of exceedance days for both one-hour and 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS has decreased, 
a decrease that is especially pronounced over the past three years.  Since 1999, the number of 
1997 eight-hour and one-hour ozone exceedance days occurring in the HGB area has fallen 83 
percent and 96 percent, respectively.  In just the last three years, the number of 1997 eight-hour 
and one-hour ozone exceedance days has fallen 76 percent and 92 percent, respectively.

Figure 5-4:  Number of Monitors and Ozone Exceedance Days in the HGB Area 
 
 
Results for individual monitors, displayed in Figure 5-5: Number of 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone 
Exceedance Days by Monitor and Figure 5-6: Number of One-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by 
Monitor support the conclusion that the number of exceedance days at individual monitors also 
appears to be decreasing.  Figure 5-5: Number of 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by 
Monitor highlights two monitors, Houston Aldine (CAMS 8) (red line) and Houston Bayland 
Park (CAMS 53) (blue line), that recorded the most 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS exceedances 
in the past.  Since recent peaks in 1999 (at Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53)) and in 2000 
(Houston Aldine (CAMS 8)), neither monitor, in any year, has come within 60 percent of these 
peaks; in 2008 both monitors experienced at least an 85 percent reduction from the recent peaks.  
While results for other monitors are less impressive, overall, the trend in ozone exceedance days 
at monitors throughout the HGB area is clearly downward.  Due to the large number of monitors 
in the HGB area, data from Figure 5-5:  Number of  1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by 
Monitor and Figure 5-6:  Number of One-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by Monitor  are 
presented in Table 5-4:  Number of Days with a 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance and Table 5-
5:  Number of Days with a One-Hour Ozone Exceedance for detailed inspection.

Figure 5-6:  Number of One-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days by Monitor 
 
 
The progress achieved in recent years in reducing eight-hour and one-hour ozone concentrations 
in the HGB area is evident in Table 5-4: Number of Days with a 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone 
Exceedance and Table 5-5: Number of Days with a One-Hour Ozone Exceedance.  The number of 
times the monitors in the HGB area registered daily peak eight-hour ozone ≥ 85 ppb fell from a 

 
 
5-18
high of 340 occurrences in 1995, to 39 occurrences in 2007, to 19 occurrences in 2008.  Prior to 
2007, that number was never below 90.  The number of monitors recording at least one 
exceedance of the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard has fallen by half, from a maximum of 23 
monitors in 2003 to only 12 in 2008. 
 
A similar pattern is apparent with the number of exceedances of the one-hour ozone NAAQS 
presented in Table 5-5: Number of Days with a One-Hour Ozone Exceedance.  The table shows 
that the total number of one-hour ozone NAAQS exceedance occurrences fell from a high of 165 
in 1995 to just three in 2008.  Prior to 2005, the number of one-hour exceedances was never 
below 50.  The three exceedances in 2008 occurred at only two monitors.  As recently as 2006, a 
total of 15 monitors recorded at least one exceedance.  This significant progress has occurred in a 
fairly short amount of time in an area well known for its air quality challenges.

The ozone season spans the entire year in the HGB area; the period of elevated ozone 
concentrations, however, varies from year to year.  Figure 5-7:  1997 Eight-Hour Ozone 
Exceedance Days in the HGB Area shows the frequency of, and variation in, the number of 1997 
eight-hour ozone NAAQS exceedance days in the HGB area by month and year.  While the 
duration and intensity of the ozone season does vary from year to year, in the past few years the 
HGB area has experienced fewer ozone exceedance days over fewer months.  The darker areas in 
the figure show that peak ozone season in the HGB area typically occurs from August to 
September, with a smaller, secondary peak occurring earlier, roughly in June.

Figure 5-7: 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days in the HGB Area 
 
 
In summary, the number and intensity of ozone exceedances in the HGB area has been dropping, 
especially since 2000, with 2007 and 2008 demonstrating the largest of these decreases. 
 
5.3.2  Ozone Trends at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors 
Twenty-three monitors in the HGB area, listed in Table 5-6:  Eight-Hour Ozone Design Values at 
Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors and Table 5-7:  One-Hour Ozone Design Values at 
Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors report ozone concentrations following EPA 
certification protocols and are used for attainment determinations for regulatory purposes.  
However, since 2003, over 20 additional monitors have become operational in the HGB area that 
measure ozone concentrations following protocols that have not been certified to EPA standards.  
Usually, this means fewer calibrations and/or zero and span checks.  These non-regulatory 
monitors are located throughout the HGB area.  The locations were chosen with the aim of 
ensuring that all episodes of elevated ozone and precursors are observed.  The additional 
monitoring sites also help to describe the spatial extent and distribution of high ozone more fully 
than the regulatory monitors alone.  While the non-regulatory monitors are not acceptable for 
making regulatory determinations, they help describe the spatial patterns of ozone more 
completely and thus provide a broader perspective on trends in ozone concentrations across the 
HGB area.

Monitors are sorted in descending order of 2008 design values, then 2007, 2006, etc.  The annual maximum of each series is noted in 
boldface type.  Because of the way design values are computed, some monitors in some years may have one-hour but not eight-hour 
design values.

The annual maximum of each series is noted in boldface type.  Because of the way design values are computed, some monitors in 
some years may have one-hour but not eight-hour design values 
 
Figure 5-8:  Distributions of Eight-Hour Ozone Design Values at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory 
Monitors in the HGB Area compares eight-hour ozone design values at regulatory and non-
regulatory monitors in the HGB area from 2003 to 2008.  This period was chosen because many 
non-regulatory monitors only became operational, or had complete data, in 2003 and later years.  
The distributions of eight-hour ozone design values dropped for both types of monitors over the 
six-year period, though the interquartile range, a measure of spread between high and low values, 
did not narrow noticeably for either.  Annual median fourth high eight-hour ozone design values 
fell from 90 ppb in 2003 to 80 ppb in 2008 at regulatory monitors, a drop of 11.1 percent.  The 
median at non-regulatory monitors fell from 89 ppb to 81 ppb over the period, a 9.0 percent drop. 
 
While medians and other moments from the distributions all dropped over the period, the annual 
maximum eight-hour ozone design value is most relevant, as this value is the current standard 
used for regulatory attainment determinations.  The annual maximum eight-hour ozone design 
value measured at regulatory monitors fell from 102 ppb in 2003 to 91 ppb in 2008, a drop of 
10.4 percent.  The annual maximum at non-regulatory monitors fell from 96 ppb in 2005, when 
three-year design values were first computable, to 94 ppb in 2008, a drop of 2.1 percent.  Note, 
however, that maximum eight-hour design values at non-regulatory monitors in 2006 and 2007 
were higher than in 2008, 104 ppb and 100 ppb respectively, presumably because those years are 
strongly influenced by the fourth high value observed at Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) in 2006 
(111 ppb).  Even though this 2006 fourth high value continued to influence the 2008 design value, 
when averaged with the 2008 fourth high value of 85 ppb, the three-year average dropped to 94 
ppb, a 6 percent decline in a single year.

The ozone design values computed for the non-regulatory monitors are within the range of design 
values computed for the regulatory monitors.  This finding suggests that both sets of monitors 
observe the same ozone behavior.  
 
Figure 5-9:  Distributions of One-Hour Ozone Design Values at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory 
Monitors in the HGB Area compares one-hour ozone design values at regulatory and non-
regulatory monitors in the HGB area from 2003 to 2008.  This period was chosen because many 
non-regulatory monitors became operational or had complete data in 2003 and later years.  The 
one-hour design value is computed as the fourth highest one-hour value observed among all 
values during each rolling three calendar-year period.  The distributions of one-hour ozone design 
values dropped for both types of monitors over the six-year period and the spread between high 
and low values narrowed for both.  Annual median fourth high one-hour ozone design values fell 
from 141 ppb in 2003 to 118 ppb in 2008 at regulatory monitors, a drop of 16.3 percent.  The 
median at non-regulatory monitors fell from 149 ppb to 122 ppb over the period, an 18.1 percent 
drop. 
 
While medians and other moments from the distributions all dropped over the period, the annual 
maximum one-hour ozone design value is most relevant, as this design value would be compared 
to the one-hour ozone NAAQS to determine attainment, were the one-hour standard still in force.  
The annual maximum one-hour ozone design value measured at regulatory monitors fell from 
175 ppb in 2003 to 147 ppb in 2008, a drop of 16.0 percent.  The annual maximum at non-
regulatory monitors fell from 161 ppb to 138 ppb over the period, or 14.3 percent.  Note that the 
eight-hour design value does not change when the data from the non-regulatory monitors are 
added to the calculation.

Figure 5-10:  1997 Eight-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory 
Monitors, 2003 through 2008 presents the number of days per year from 2003 through 2008 that 
the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS was exceeded in the HGB area at regulatory monitors and at 
all monitors, both regulatory and non-regulatory.  Since 2005, the combined network has 
recorded a total of 19 additional exceedances of the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard that would 
not have been captured by the regulatory network, i.e., about four to five per year.  This result 
confirms earlier findings that suggest as the monitoring network has expanded, fewer episodes of 
elevated ozone concentrations are likely to elude detection.

Figure 5-11:  One-Hour Ozone Exceedance Days at Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors, 
2003 through 2008 presents the number of days per year from 2003 through 2008 that the one-
hour ozone NAAQS was exceeded in the HGB area at regulatory monitors and at all monitors, 
both regulatory and non-regulatory.  Both series initially increased, then fell at similar rates 
throughout the period, suggesting that the two sets of monitors measure broadly similar 
phenomena.  During the first half of the period, non-regulatory monitors measured from five to 
nine additional exceedance days that were not detected by regulatory monitors.  However, in the 
second half of the period, that gap dropped to only two to three additional days, indicating that 
non-regulatory monitors are detecting fewer and fewer events not detected by regulatory 
monitors.  This result confirms earlier findings that suggest that, as the monitoring network has 
expanded, fewer episodes of elevated ozone concentrations are likely to elude detection.

Another way to see the ozone trend in the HGB area is to examine how the spatial distributions of 
ozone have changed over the years.  Figure 5-12:  Eight-Hour Ozone Design Values for 2000, 
2005, and 2008 shows the spatial distribution of eight-hour ozone design values in the HGB area, 
for regulatory monitors only, and the changes that have occurred from 2000 to 2005 to 2008.  In 
2000, local peaks in design value were at Houston Aldine (CAMS 8), Houston Bayland Park 
(CAMS 53), and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139), and all three peaks were 110 ppb or higher. 
 
By 2005, eight-hour ozone design values had dropped across the region.  While the highest 
concentrations still occurred at Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 
35/139), they were no longer observed in the Houston Aldine (CAMS 8) area.  Further, the 2005 
peaks are much lower, between 100 and 103 ppb.  The lowest eight-hour ozone concentration is 
still observed at Lang (CAMS 408), but low ozone also occurs to the northeast at Houston North 
Wayside (CAMS 405), to the north at Conroe (CAMS 65) or Conroe Relocated (CAMS 78), and 
to the south at Galveston Airport (CAMS 34/CAMS 109/CAMS 154).  The minimum eight-hour 
ozone concentration in 2005 is below the 1997 NAAQS.   
 
In 2008, eight-hour ozone design values dropped even further.  Ozone concentrations are 
substantially lower across a large part of the HGB area, with the kriging model predicting design 
values below the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS at many locations.  Maximum eight-hour ozone 
concentrations are now considerably lower, between 89 ppb and 91 ppb.  The highest 
measurements occurred at Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139), 
and also at a new monitor, Park Place (CAMS 416), which measured ozone in the same range as 
Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139).  The eight-hour ozone 
concentrations in 2008 are lower throughout the HGB area, with a local ozone minimum located 
in the urban core area surrounding the Lang (CAMS 408), Houston North Wayside (CAMS 405), 
Houston Texas Avenue (CAMS 411), Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304), and the 
TCEQ Houston Regional Office (CAMS 81) monitors. 
 
Notice that while the overall concentrations of eight-hour ozone are lower, the areas that 
experience the highest and lowest ozone remain the same.  Spatial interpolation shows that high 
ozone concentrations continue to occur south of downtown Houston, and stretch from the 
Houston Ship Channel in the east to west Houston, near Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53).  The 
lowest ozone values are found to the south along the coast, at the northern edge of the 
nonattainment area towards Conroe (CAMS 65), and to the northwest of downtown Houston, at 
Lang (CAMS 408).

The kriging method can also be employed to investigate the geographic origins of high ozone 
concentrations.  Studies during the TexAQS 2000 field study reported that the highest ozone in 
the HGB area occurs in plumes emanating from industrial areas (Daum et al., 2004; Kleinman et 
al., 2005; Ryerson et al., 2003; Berkowitz et al., 2005; Banta et al., 2005).  As these plumes are 
transported across the region, they can be tracked by the high ozone concentrations recorded at 
successive downwind monitors as the day progresses.  An analysis of the time of day of 
maximum ozone at each monitoring site can confirm or challenge conclusions of the field study 
about these origins by revealing spatial patterns of ozone formation and movement. 
 
Yet another way to examine the ozone behavior in the HGB area is to investigate the time of day 
that ozone peaks, on average, in each part of the monitoring network.  Daily maximum ozone 
concentrations were divided into two groups:  days with values exceeding the 1997 eight-hour 
ozone NAAQS, and days not exceeding the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS.  The time of day 
when peak ozone was recorded at each monitor was determined for each day, then averaged 
across the two groupings of days.  Only monitors that report data to the EPA were included.  
Days were restricted to March through November to exclude months when few or no exceedance 
days occur in the HGB area. 
 
Maps of the time of peak ozone in the HGB area, averaged from March through November 1998-
2008, are found in Figure 5-13:  Time of Day of Peak Hourly Ozone on Low and High Ozone 
Days.  The left map shows that on days with low eight-hour ozone values, daily maximum values 
are recorded in the Galveston area early in the day, between 11:30 a.m. and 11:45 a.m.  Inland 
monitors record their highest daily values at progressively later times of day, as monitors are 
located farther inland from the Gulf Coast.  On low ozone days, the earliest ozone maxima occur 
near the coast, and the latest occur in the Conroe area between 2:00 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. This 
pattern of ozone concentrations is consistent with the occurrence of the sea breeze, which often 
dominates local weather during the summer in the absence of strong synoptic-scale weather 
influences.  After the plume is carried past a monitor, ozone levels often drop, reflecting the 
cleaner maritime air behind the sea breeze front.   
 
By contrast, the right map of the daily pattern on high eight-hour ozone days looks quite different.  
Daily maximum ozone concentrations are observed earliest in the industrial areas, and 
successively later at sites that are progressively farther away from these areas.  This pattern 
indicates that high ozone forms first in the industrial areas, and is transported outward to urban, 
suburban, and rural sites later in the day.  Maximum ozone occurs latest at Lake Jackson (CAMS 
1016), Clute (CAMS 11), Northwest Harris Co. (CAMS 26), Conroe (CAMS 65) and Conroe 
Relocated (CAMS 78), the sites at the greatest distance from the industrial area. 
 
The time of day of maximum ozone on high eight-hour ozone days represents a composite 
pattern:  high ozone formed in industrial areas is carried by winds to Conroe (CAMS 65) and 
Conroe Relocated (CAMS 78) on some days, to Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016) on other days, and 
to western Houston on other days.  Combined with the earlier spatial design value analysis, the 
patterns of peak ozone appear to show that the highest ozone concentrations are formed in the 
vicinity of the heavily industrialized areas of metropolitan Houston and are then transported 
throughout the area.

5.3.3  Trends in the Strength of Observed Ozone Gradients in the HGB Area 
Rapid ozone increases have been observed at HGB area monitoring sites for many years, but the 
phenomenon was not sufficiently explained until the TexAQS 2000 study.  Researchers from 
Brookhaven National Laboratory and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) Aeronomy Laboratory were able to establish that the rapid ozone increases were due to 
strong spatial ozone gradients that arose when ozone formed very rapidly in industrial plumes.  
The rapid ozone formation observed by Daum et al. (2003, 2004) allowed ozone to build up in the 
plumes before ozone and its precursors could disperse.  Shifting winds due to the coastal 
oscillation or bay/Gulf breeze phenomena pushed the strong ozone gradients over the monitoring 
sites, resulting in observations of rapid ozone increases (Banta et al., 2005).  The rapid ozone 
formation occurs when industrial HRVOC reacts with co-emitted NOX (Ryerson et al., 2003; 
Wert et al., 2003).  The following analysis examines whether the strength of these ozone 
gradients has lessened, as measured by the magnitude of one-hour changes in ozone observed at 
monitoring sites. 
 
One-hour changes in ozone concentrations examined for each hour during the ozone season (May 
through October) at each site for each year.  The maximum daily peak change in ozone 
concentration was chosen for each day, and various statistical measures were calculated from 
those values.  Not all sites were included in this analysis:  only those with long operating histories 
were included.   
 
Figure 5-14:  Trends in the Strength of Ozone Gradients Measured in the HGB Area from 1995 
through 2008 shows how the daily maximum one-hour change in ozone has changed since 1995 
in the HGB area.  While at the mean and median levels the change is slight, the steepest observed 
ozone gradients have been reduced dramatically since 1995, decreasing by about 40 percent.

Figure 5-14:  Trends in the Strength of Ozone Gradients Measured in the HGB Area from

Figure 5-15:  The Number of Occurrences of One-Hour Increases in Ozone Greater Than 40 
ppb/hr in the HGB Area for the Subset of Monitors with Long Historical Records shows that the 
number of strong ozone gradients observed by monitoring sites in the HGB area has also 
decreased substantially since the 1990s, matching the general trends in decreasing ozone 
concentrations. The intensity of ozone gradients has decreased, and the frequency of strong ozone 
gradient observations has also decreased, which strongly suggests that ozone is forming less 
rapidly in the HGB area than in previous years.  This change in ozone behavior is consistent with 
decreasing reactivity of VOC emitted in the HGB area.  Note that the intensity of ozone gradients 
can depend upon meteorological factors as well as chemical factors.  This analysis has not 
examined the importance of meteorological factors upon the observed trends.  Subsequent 
sections will discuss trends in HRVOC concentrations.

5.3.4  The Impact of Hurricane Ike on Ozone Observations in the HGB Area 
The HGB area typically records high ozone values each year in September.  Sometimes, these 
values help determine the area-wide design value for that year.  The HGB eight-hour ozone 
design value has been declining recently and was particularly low in 2008 (91 ppb).  September 
2008 was not typical for the HGB area.  Hurricane Ike, a strong Category 2 hurricane, struck the 
Texas coast near Galveston Bay on September 13, 2008.  Most monitors in the area were shut 
down and emissions patterns were substantially altered. 
 
Hurricane Ike struck the Texas coast near Galveston Bay on September 13, 2008.  Before the 
hurricane struck, the evacuation of Galveston Island and the surrounding areas created enormous 
traffic jams.  After the storm passed, there was far less automobile traffic than normal for several 
weeks.  In preparation for the storm, many of the local petrochemical facilities shut down their 
operations, generating unknown quantities of emissions in the process, and after the storm, their 
operations were atypical for an extended period.  Rescue operations, tree cutting and burning, 
lack of electrical power, unusual traffic patterns, and abnormal industrial operations were among 
the atypical conditions that occurred before, during, and after the hurricane.  The exact effect of 
the emission changes on ozone concentrations is unknown, due to the number of ozone 
monitoring sites disabled indirectly or directly by Hurricane Ike.  Monitors in the HGB area 
ceased operations for as little as one day, and as long as 69 days at a site that was severely 
damaged by storm surge.  Key monitors that typically record the area design values were down 
for as much as 16 days, e.g., Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) (see Table 5-10:  List of the 
Number of Days HGB Ozone Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Monitors were Not Operating 
Before and After the Landfall of Hurricane Ike).

Hurricane Ike’s greatest impact occurred during the second half of September and the first half of 
October.  August and September are typically the months when the HGB area records the most 
number of days that exceed the ozone standard.  For 2000 through 2008, 21 percent of the 266 
observed 85 ppb exceedance days in the HGB area were recorded in September (Figure 5-16:  
Number of Days that Exceeded the 1997 Eight-Hour Ozone NAAQS by Month from 2000 through 
2008).

in Texas, September 2006 and Figure 5-18:  Frequency of Daily Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Values 
for All Ozone Monitoring Sites in Texas, September 2008 show peak eight-hour ozone at all 
Texas monitoring sites in September 2006, which was unaffected by tropical systems and in  
September 2008, the month in which Hurricane Ike struck.  In 2008, the number of monitors in 
operation dropped substantially just before the hurricane made landfall, as they were shut down 
by the TCEQ.  The monitors came back on-line gradually, as electrical power was restored, and 
storm damage was repaired.  Ozone concentrations immediately before and after Ike were fairly 
low.   
 
The purpose of this analysis is to examine how the ozone behavior in September and October 
2008 deviated from the 2000 through 2007 average, and thus to ascertain whether the lower 
design value observed in 2008 was due primarily to the effects of Hurricane Ike.

5.3.4.1  Approach 
One approach to estimate the influence of Hurricane Ike on the HGB area’s ozone design value is 
to estimate what the eight-hour ozone design value might have been in 2008 if Hurricane Ike had 
not occurred.  This estimate is derived from historical data collected during 2000-2007.  
Removing calendar days affected by Hurricane Ike and replacing them with averages derived 
from historical data yields a re-calculated fourth-highest eight-hour ozone concentration for each 
monitor.  The actual fourth-high is then divided by the re-calculated fourth-high to obtain an 

 
 
5-38
adjustment ratio or an Ike Adjustment Factor (IAF).  This ratio is expected to be greater than one, 
and can be used to adjust 2008 ozone data to non-hurricane conditions.  The IAF can be 
calculated as an area-wide average IAF or as a monitor-specific IAF.  An area-wide average IAF 
is computed as the average of all IAFs from all monitors in the region, applied to all 2008 data.  
The monitor-specific IAF was applied only to the monitor in question.  After the data were 
adjusted with  IAFs, an IAF-corrected design value was calculated and compared to the current 
unadjusted ozone design value to determine the influence of Hurricane Ike.   
 
The days affected by Hurricane Ike are not easy to identify.  As stated before, many unusual 
activities occurred in the HGB area before the arrival of Hurricane Ike, and many others occurred 
in the aftermath.  For example, many industrial facilities shut down operations before the storm 
arrived, releasing emissions that they usually would not release.  After the hurricane, electrical 
power was not available in parts of the HGB area for two or more weeks.  Given the difficulties 
in establishing the exact period of Hurricane Ike’s influence, alternative IAFs were calculated by 
removing three different time periods from the historical ozone data.  The first period considered 
for exclusion was a two-week period from September 11 through September 25, 2008, which 
includes days immediately before and after the hurricane.  Two other periods considered for 
exclusion were a one-month period from September 6 through October 5, 2008, and a one-month 
period after the storm (September 13 through October 12, 2008).   All data used in this analysis 
were obtained from the TCEQ-LEADS system, and are eight-hour ozone averages.  The HGB 
area eight-hour ozone design value was obtained from the EPA. 
 
5.3.4.2  Results 
Table 5-11:  Alternative Fourth-High Daily Peak Eight-Hour Ozone Concentration Calculations 
Using Different Ike Adjustment Factors (IAFs) shows results of the six different methods for 
estimating the fourth-high daily peak eight-hour ozone concentration for each monitoring site.  
The table shows that the expected fourth high is greater than the observed at most sites, regardless 
of which method is used to calculate the expected fourth high.  This indicates that the atypical 
conditions experienced during and after Hurricane Ike during September and October in 2008 did 
have an effect on the monitored values, but the effect was no greater than 4 ppb on the fourth-
high daily maximum ozone concentration.

This table compares the observed 2008 fourth-high at each monitor to the expected fourth high, as 
calculated by six different methods. 
 
 
The attainment status of an area is not based upon fourth-high ozone concentrations, but upon 
design values.  Table 5-12:  Observed and Expected Design Values, Recalculated to Account for 
Hurricane Ike shows the observed 2008 design value, and the expected design values, as 
calculated with the six different methods described above.  As Table 5-12:  Observed and 
Expected Design Values, Recalculated to Account for Hurricane Ike shows, the effect upon the 
design value for the HGB area is at most 1 ppb, and for two of the alternatives there is no effect.  
This analysis is robust, because six different methods of estimating the effect of the hurricane on 
ozone design value have given substantially the same answer:  the 2008 eight-hour ozone design 
value was not different from the expected design value, based upon comparisons with historical 
data.  Therefore, based upon the historical analysis, the effect of Hurricane Ike upon the eight-
hour ozone design value in the HGB area was apparently minimal.

5.3.5  NOX Trends 
Nitrogen oxides, or NOX, are a variable mixture of NO and NO2 and are critical precursors to 
ozone formation.  NOX is primarily created by fossil fuel combustion, lightning, biomass burning, 
and microbial action in the soil. 
 
Previous analyses performed using aircraft measurements and emission inventories obtained 
during TexAQS 2000 and TexAQS II indicate that NOX emissions in the Houston Ship Channel 
area have decreased between 2000 and 2006 (Cowling et al., 2007).  Furthermore, aircraft data 
obtained during the two field studies were in agreement with data measured by continuous 
emission monitoring systems (CEMS) located at the facilities.  Analyses done by the Rapid 
Science Synthesis Team of the 2005-2006 Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS II) indicate that 
NOX emissions at several electric generating units (EGUs) have decreased by factors ranging 
from two to four between 2000 and 2006 (Cowling et al., 2007).  These reductions were seen at 
EGUs that implemented NOX control features, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), 
between 2000 and 2006, which suggests these control strategies are working.  The two field 
studies effectively describe the emissions during two short time windows, six years apart.  To 
complement these analyses, the TCEQ has performed a more comprehensive investigation of 
long-term trends in NOX concentrations. 
 
Daily peak one-hour NOX from all monitors in the HGB area from 1991 through 2008 is plotted 
in Figure 5-19:  Daily Peak Hourly NOX in the HGB Area.  The increasing density of NOX data 
points shows that the number of NOX monitors in the HGB area has greatly increased since 1991.  
Annual 90th percentile and annual average NOX values are also plotted in the figure.  Both of 
these measures have decreased markedly over the 1991 to 2008 period, falling 64 percent and 68 
percent, respectively.  Even more remarkable may be the 53 percent and 48 percent declines since 
1999.

Though highly variable from season to season, daily peak hourly NOX also shows a general 
decreasing trend since 1991.  Maximum NOX concentrations have decreased overall by 41 
percent  since 1999, an average of roughly 32 ppb per year, or nearly 6 percent per year.  The 
drop since the 1991 high of 880 ppb is 54 percent or greater than 4 percent annually. 
 
Average daily peak hourly NOX has dropped even more precipitously, falling 53 percent, or 8 
percent per year, from 75 ppb to 35 ppb, since 1999.   Since 1991, average hourly NOX has 
dropped 68 percent, or over 6 percent per year, from the series high of 110 ppb.  Notice that in 
2008, both the NO2 design value and maximum daily peak NOX recorded the lowest values of any 
previous year back to 1991.

While the highest NOX values occur in the winter, the NOX values during the summer months, 
when ozone production is the highest, are of particular interest.  Trends in median hourly NOX 
concentrations at individual monitors in the HGB area from May through October, 1998 to 2008, 
are shown in Figure 5-20:  Median NOX Concentrations in the HGB Area.  Four monitors of 
particular interest, Houston Texas Avenue (CAMS 411), Lang (CAMS 408), Clinton (CAMS 
403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304), and Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53), are highlighted.  Sites with 
less than 75 percent complete data for a year were not plotted for that year; for example, Clinton 
(CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) had less than 75 percent complete data in 2008 and 
therefore was not plotted.

Figure 5-20:  Median NOX Concentrations in the HGB Area 
 
 
Median NOX values tend to vary from year to year, but most monitors show overall decreases in 
median NOX since 1998.  Monitors that show the smallest decreases or show no change are at 
sites that have traditionally had lower NOX concentrations.  Some of the largest median NOX 
concentrations were measured at the Lang (CAMS 408) monitor (in close proximity to Highway 
290), and at the Houston Texas Avenue (CAMS 411) monitor (in downtown Houston).  These 
monitors are both near major roadways; their similar trends suggest they may be measuring 
decreases in NOX emissions from mobile sources.  Monitors at Galveston Airport (CAMS 
34/C109/C154), Seabrook Friendship Park (CAMS 45), and Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016) 
measured the lowest median NOX concentrations. 
 
Sites recording among the highest ozone design values, for example, Houston Bayland Park 
(CAMS 53) and Park Place (CAMS 416), are not necessarily the sites with the highest median 
NOX concentrations.  The previous section showed that Houston Bayland Park (CAMS 53) has 
the highest eight-hour ozone design value in the HGB area of 91 ppb, yet it has a lower median 
NOX concentration than many other sites in the area.  This observation is consistent with the 
behavior expected from ozone chemistry; in addition to being an ozone precursor, NO also reacts 
directly with ozone and in areas with high NO emissions, can destroy more ozone than it creates.  

 
 
5-44
Downwind from the high emission areas, however, ozone destroyed by reaction with NO can re-
form. 
 
The largest decreases since 1998 (Table 5-14:  Median and 90th Percentile Hourly NOX Values) 
were observed at monitors primarily influenced by mobile source emissions, rather than industrial 
sources.  Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) and Houston East (CAMS 1), which are 
located near both industrial sources and highways, have seen larger decreases in median NOX 
values than in 90th percentile values since 1998.  At Houston East (CAMS 1), the 90th percentile 
value decreased 34 percent, while the median decreased 42 percent between 1998 and 2008.  The 
Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) monitor experienced a drop of 16 percent in the 90th 
percentile, with a 21 percent decrease in the median between 1998 and 2007 (2008 was not used 
due to incomplete data), though these measures have increased in recent years.

* Percentage changes computed from 1998 to 2007 for years missing 2008 data, due to 
incomplete data. 
Monitors are sorted in increasing order by percentage change in median values.  Monitors with 
indeterminate trends began operating after 1998. 
 
While several monitors recorded large decreases from 2007 to 2008, most others observed only 
minimal changes over that same period.  These large disparities in patterns of ambient NOX 
concentrations across the region are appropriate for further investigation, suggesting that larger 
decreases are not due solely to variations in meteorological conditions, which would be expected 

 
 
5-45
to influence all monitors similarly, though not identically.  The differences seem to be related to 
the relative magnitudes of the overall concentrations.  Sites with the highest concentrations, 
which tend to be urban sites, showed the greatest decrease.  More rural sites like Lake Jackson 
(CAMS 1016), Conroe (CAMS 65), and Conroe Relocated (CAMS 78) may reflect slight 
changes in background values, while more urban sites may reflect actual emission changes. 
 
Similar to ozone, NOX concentrations in the HGB area appear to be decreasing over time, in large 
measure the result of the comprehensive suite of NOX-targeted controls implemented since 2000.  
Stringent point source NOX standards have been adopted along with numerous factors affecting 
mobile source NOX emissions.   
 
5.3.6  Ambient VOC Concentrations 
The other major class of compounds that are ozone precursors are VOC.  TexAQS 2000 
researchers identified a specific subset of VOC that were closely associated with rapid and 
efficient ozone formation, i.e., light alkenes (Ryerson et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2003, 2004; 
Jobson et al., 2004).  The TCEQ examined the historical data for these compounds, and decided 
to regulate several light alkenes emitted by industry that were particularly reactive, and that often 
had particularly high concentrations: ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes.   
 
Since the mid-1990s, the TCEQ has collected 40-minute measurements, on an hourly basis, of 45 
VOC compounds using automated gas chromatograph (auto-GC) instruments.  Initially, 
measurements were collected at just one site (Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304)), but 
in subsequent years, auto-GC monitors have been added to new sites (see Figure 5-21:  Houston 
Ship Channel Auto-GC Monitors and 2006 Reported Point Source HRVOC Emissions Points and 
Plant Boundaries).  Currently, eight sites, listed in Table 5-15:  Auto-GC Monitors in the Houston 
Ship Channel Area, along or near the Houston Ship Channel, along with three in Brazoria County 
and one in Texas City, are collecting VOC measurements with auto-GCs.

Ambient concentrations of the TCEQ-defined HRVOC (ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-
butene, c-2-butene, and t-2-butene) were analyzed from 1995 to 2008.

Trends at each of the eight Houston Ship Channel monitors were examined.  Data from the four 
other auto-GC monitors were analyzed only for trend slope and possible statistical significance of 
trends.  Daily geometric means were computed from valid ambient hourly measurements for days 
with at least 18 valid hours of data.  A geometric mean was calculated by taking the natural 
logarithm of each of the measurements, averaging these logs, then calculating the antilog of this 
mean log value.  The geometric mean is a preferable statistic to median or arithmetic (ordinary) 
mean for evaluating the central tendency of data when the data are skewed, that is, when the data 
are not symmetrically, or normally, distributed, but clustered around extreme high or low values.  
It is more robust than an ordinary average, meaning its value is not greatly influenced by one or a 
few very high or very low values.  Many distributions of pollutant measurements in the HGB area 
are skewed.  Monthly geometric means were also computed with a 75 percent data completeness 
criterion for valid days in a month. 
 
Figure 5-22:  Monthly Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors, July 1995 through December 2008 shows monthly geometric mean ethylene 
concentrations, ordered according to the monitor location from west to east.  Grey bars denote the 
range of values from the 25th through 75th percentile concentrations, for all monitors.  Noteworthy 
in this figure is the frequency of extremely high values recorded during the 1990s at Clinton 
(CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304), at the western end of the Houston Ship Channel, and Deer 
Park (CAMS 35/139), in south central Houston Ship Channel.  These were the only monitors 
operating during the early years of this period; this pattern suggests that high ethylene 
concentrations were not restricted to certain areas of the Houston Ship Channel, but were 
somewhat geographically widespread.  
 
 

 
 
5-47
Figure 5-22:  Monthly Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors, July 1995 through December 2008 
 
 
For four consecutive years, July 1995 through July 1999, valid monthly geometric mean 
concentrations at Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) exceeded the 75th percentile of the 
multi-decade series.  Deer Park (CAMS 35/139) also exhibited high concentrations in the first 
several years, including the highest mean value for any complete month, 10.2 parts per billion, 
carbon (ppbC) in March 2001.  By contrast, few monthly mean concentrations exceeded the 75th 
percentile in the most recent four years, 2005 through 2008. 
 
Though measured ethylene and propylene concentrations show a large degree of variability at all 
auto-GC monitors, downward trends are apparent at seven of the eight; only Wallisville Road 

 
 
5-48
(CAMS 617) appears to show no decrease.  A statistical trend analysis, described below, provides 
further insight into this. 
 
Peak monthly geometric mean ethylene concentrations at all monitors, 6.9 ppbC and 8.4 ppbC in 
2003 and 2004 respectively, decreased to 5.6 ppbC in 2005, 4.9 ppbC in 2006, and 4.5 ppbC in 
2007, before climbing to 5.1 ppbC in 2008.  This decline in ambient ethylene concentrations 
suggests that ethylene emissions in the Houston Ship Channel are declining, though meteorology 
could be responsible for some or all of the decline in geometric mean concentrations. 
 
Similar to Figure 5-22:  Monthly Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston 
Ship Channel Monitors, July 1995 through December 2008, Figure 5-23:  Monthly Geometric 
Mean Propylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston Ship Channel Monitors, July 1995 through 
December 2008 displays monthly geometric mean concentrations of propylene for the eight 
Houston Ship Channel area auto-GC monitors.  Again, Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 
304) and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139) show higher concentrations in earlier years compared to 
recent ones; however, the magnitude of concentrations at the two monitors are dissimilar, unlike 
ethylene, suggesting elevated propylene concentrations are more geographically limited than 
elevated ethylene concentrations.  Two other eastern Houston Ship Channel monitors, 
Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 115) and Lynchburg Ferry (CAMS 1015), report concentrations 
well above the 75th percentile in 2003, and to a lesser extent in 2004 and subsequent years, 
suggesting there are greater propylene emissions in the eastern Houston Ship Channel than the 
western Houston Ship Channel.  However, the relatively fast reactivity of propylene, compared to 
ethylene, may explain part or all of the low concentrations seen in the western Houston Ship 
Channel. 
 
Similar analyses were performed for 1, 3-butadiene and the isomers of butene; however, trends in 
these pollutants can be difficult to interpret, as their relatively low concentrations are frequently 
within accepted measurement uncertainty.  Further work is needed before trend estimation for 
these compounds can be considered accurate.   
 
Though still variable from month to month, pervasive decreases in the ambient concentrations of 
ethylene and propylene suggest that overall industrial emissions of these compounds have 
decreased considerably since 1995.  This finding agrees with early reports from TexAQS II that 
ethylene emissions along the Houston Ship Channel have decreased approximately 40 percent 
from 2000 to 2006.   
 
 

 
 
5-49
Figure 5-23:  Monthly Geometric Mean Propylene Concentrations at the Eight Houston 
Ship Channel Monitors, July 1995 through December 2008 
 
 
A preliminary analysis was performed to verify whether decreases observed were statistically 
significant.  Ordinary least squares regression lines were fit to the monthly geometric mean 
ethylene and propylene concentrations, using an index of month, where the first recorded month 
was given a value of zero.  Results of these fits are reported in Table 5-16:  Parameter Estimates 
of Monthly Geometric Mean Concentrations Trends.  In 23 of the 24 regressions, concentrations 
decreased across the respective study periods, with correlation coefficient (R2) values ranging 
from 0.045 to 0.549.  Eight of 12 monitors recorded statistically significant decreases for 
ethylene, including six of eight Houston Ship Channel monitors.  All 12 monitors recorded 
statistically significant decreases for propylene.  However, caution must be exercised when 

 
 
5-50
interpreting these results.  First, some of the computed R2 values are very low, confirming there is 
a substantial degree of variation in the measured values, with only a portion of it explained by a 
simple linear model.  Further statistical testing and verification, such as testing for and correcting 
possible autocorrelation, is necessary to fully validate these models.

5.3.7  Geographic Patterns in Ambient HRVOC Concentrations Near the Houston Ship 
Channel 
The next analysis showed that, for some HRVOC, geographic patterns are apparent.  Wind speed 
and wind direction measurements, collected in tandem with HRVOC concentrations at the 
Houston Ship Channel auto-GC monitors, were used not only to identify these patterns, but to 
track their changes over time.  Radar plots of geometric mean concentrations of ethylene and 
propylene, by wind direction, were plotted, superimposed on maps of the Houston Ship Channel, 
and displayed in Figure 5-24:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors through Figure 5-27: Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Western 
Houston Ship Channel Monitors. 
 
These plots consist of jagged rings encircling a monitor.  Each ring around a particular monitor 
represents the geometric mean concentration of the subject HRVOC at each of the 360 degrees 
surrounding the monitor, for a particular year.  The distance from the origin to any point on the 
ring is proportional to the concentration of HRVOC arriving at the monitor from that direction.  
For example, Figure 5-25:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at Eastern Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors shows that in 2003 at Deer Park (CAMS 35/139), the highest mean ethylene 
concentration, 16 ppbC, occurred when winds were blowing from the northeast, suggesting there 
may be large ethylene emissions sources upwind of Deer Park (CAMS 35/139) in that direction.   
 
To help interpret these graphs, it is useful to describe a couple of hypothetical scenarios.  In the 
first one, if HRVOC did not vary when winds arrived from different directions, i.e., the same 
concentrations were observed regardless of the wind direction, the ring would be a smooth circle.  

 
 
5-51
Conversely, in the second scenario, if HRVOC were detected only when winds arrived from a 
single direction, the ring would simply be an elongated spike pointing in that direction. 
 
In Figures 5-24: Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors through 5-27: Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship 
Channel Monitors, for the Houston Ship Channel monitors, a strong directional association with 
mean concentration is typical.  The directional spikes seen in these rings are referred to as “lobes” 
in this section. 
 
 
Figure 5-24:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors 
 
 
Sources of ethylene (blue circles) and propylene (brown circles) are also depicted on the map of 
the respective compound, with sizes proportional to values reported in the 2006 TCEQ point 
source emissions inventory.  Valid hourly measurements from 2002 through 2008 were used; 
hours with hourly wind speed measurements less than two miles per hour (mph) were discarded, 
due to considerable error in wind direction measurements at low wind speeds. 
 
While a compound’s concentration for a particular wind direction at a particular monitor is 
proportional to the distance from the monitor to the ring at that direction, the scale differs across 
monitors.  For example, peak 2003 ethylene concentration (see Figure 5-25:  Geometric Mean 
Ethylene Concentrations at Eastern Houston Ship Channel Monitors) at Lynchburg Ferry 
(CAMS 1015) is 24 ppbC, and 15 ppbC at Wallisville Road (CAMS 617), yet the length from 
each monitor to its respective peak (tip of sharp “point”) is approximately the same.  For this 
reason, peak concentration at each monitor, for each pollutant, is labeled. 
 

 
 
5-52
 
Figure 5-25:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors 
 
 
Figure 5-24:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors shows mean ethylene concentrations at the three western-most Houston Ship Channel 
auto-GC monitors.  Sources of ethylene having the greatest impact on these monitors are all 
located east of the monitors, because the greatest peaks for each monitor point in this direction for 
all the years.  The plot also shows trends across time at each monitor.  At Clinton (CAMS 
403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304), peak ethylene occurred in 2003 from almost due east, as seen in the 
lobe labeled “14 ppbC.”  Following 2003 and 2004, peak concentrations from that direction have 
been somewhat lower.  Also, the lobes pointing south observed in 2003 and 2004 are markedly 
smaller in 2005 and subsequent years.  An olefins production plant located in the Houston Milby 
Park (A169) area shut down in 2005; its emissions may have been responsible for those lobes. 
 
The plot shows mean ethylene concentrations for the Cesar Chavez (CAMS 1020/175) and 
Houston Milby Park (A169) monitors, which started operation in 2004 and 2005, respectively.  
While these monitors measured peak concentrations in different years, both monitors have peaks 
pointing in the direction of the Houston Milby Park (A169) olefins plant while it was in 
operation; Houston Milby Park (A169) observed a large lobe to the southeast in 2005, and Cesar 
Chavez (CAMS 1020/175) observed a notable lobe to the north in 2004 and 2005.  This provides 
a stronger indication, when combined with the Clinton (CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) peak 
to the south, of the influence of emissions from that plant on local concentrations. 
 
Figure 5-25:  Geometric Mean Ethylene Concentrations at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors shows mean ethylene concentrations at the five auto-GC monitors located in the eastern 
part of the Houston Ship Channel.  Variation in mean concentrations by direction is even more 
pronounced here than in the western portion of the Houston Ship Channel.  The pattern in mean 
concentrations at Lynchburg Ferry (CAMS 1015) suggests there is a large source of ethylene 
emissions south-southeast of the monitor, near Battleground Road and Highway 225, and that 
emissions from this area have decreased.

The pattern observed at Deer Park (CAMS 35/139) may provide additional evidence of suspected 
emission decreases in the same source area.  The northeast lobe in Table 5-17:  Geometric Mean 
Ethylene for Key Wind Direction Lobes at Eastern Houston Ship Channel Monitors has dropped 
from a high of 16.6 ppbC in 2003 to a range of about 11 to 13 ppbC in recent years.  Similarly, 
the southeast lobe at Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 115), which points yet again to the same 
source area, peaked at 12.5 ppbC in 2003, dropped to 11.9 ppbC in 2004, and has not exceeded 
7.1 ppbC since.  While this monitor is farther from this source region than are the other two 
monitors, and therefore is more likely to be impacted by other emissions sources, consistent 
decreases observed at these three monitors across the six-year span of available data suggest 
ethylene emissions have decreased in the subject source region.   
 
HRM-3 Haden Road (CAMS 603) shows a peak of 24.8 ppbC to the southeast in 2003, which fell 
to 18 ppbC in 2004, then further to 15.6 ppbC in 2005.  The mean concentration has dropped 
since then, not exceeding 5.2 ppbC.  The magnitude of the decrease over 2006 to 2008, as 
compared to 2005 and earlier years, suggests a shut down of one or more major process units, or 
even entire plants, somewhere southeast of this monitor, or implementation of HRVOC rules. 
 
Peaks at the Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor point southwest, toward the east Houston 
Ship Channel, and east-northeast, in the direction of the Mont Belvieu industrial area, where there 
is considerable ethylene and propylene storage in underground salt caverns.  Table 5-17:  
Geometric Mean Ethylene for Key Wind Direction Lobes at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors shows that ethylene originating to the southwest decreased from the six-year peak in 
2003 (15 ppbC), to a range from 9.9 to 11.1 ppbC, before rising slightly to 12.8 ppbC in 2008.  In 
contrast, the east-northeast lobe at this monitor shows relatively unvarying mean concentrations 

 
 
5-54
across the entire six-year period, ranging from 9.2 to 11.6 ppbC, with the six-year peak occurring 
in 2008. 
 
These conclusions for five monitors and eight directional lobes show a nearly consistent pattern 
across these monitors.  Seven of eight lobes witnessed their highest mean concentration in 2003.  
Within one or two years of this peak, concentrations at all seven had dropped, from 27 to 65 
percent, and have leveled off since; mean concentrations have not varied appreciably from 2006 
to 2008.  These findings suggest ethylene emissions from source areas close to these monitors, 
especially Battleground Road, Highway 225 in La Porte, and the petrochemical complex north of 
the Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 115) monitor, have decreased considerably in recent years.  
These observations suggest that the new TCEQ regulations specifically targeting HRVOC 
emissions and requiring full compliance by 2006 are proving effective in controlling point source 
HRVOC emissions.  However, the trends shown here have not been corrected for meteorological 
variations.   
 
Results for the lobe pointing east-northeast from the Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) monitor 
disagree with some key findings at other lobes.  The Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) east-northeast 
lobe, unique among the eight, experienced an increase in mean concentration from 2003 (9.7 
ppbC) to 2004 (11.5 ppbC). While 2006 to 2008 mean concentrations at Wallisville Road (CAMS 
617), like those of other monitors and lobes, changed relatively little, mean concentrations of the 
east-northeast Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) lobe changed relatively little across the entire six-
year period.  The absence of recent decreases at this lobe compared to earlier years suggests that 
meteorology may not have caused high concentrations seen at most other lobes in earlier years. 
 
Figure 5-26:  Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Eastern Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors displays monthly geometric mean concentrations of propylene in the same area of the 
eastern Houston Ship Channel.  Table 5-18:  Geometric Mean Propylene Concentrations for Key 
Wind Directions at Eastern Houston Ship Channel Monitors lists mean propylene concentrations 
across the study period, for each monitor and lobe.  Similarities with ethylene are evident.  For 
propylene, all seven lobes measured their highest concentrations in 2003 or 2004; five of the 
seven had their two lowest annual concentrations in 2007 and 2008.  All seven lobes had 
concentrations in 2007 and 2008 that were 40 percent or more lower than their respective six-year 
peaks.

These results suggest that the propylene emissions in the source regions near the monitors have 
dropped considerably in the six-year study period, and that the HRVOC regulations may be 
responsible for the decreases.  As seen with ethylene, patterns in geometric mean propylene 
concentrations at the east-northeast Wallisville Road (CAMS 617) lobe differed considerably 
from the other seven.  Propylene concentrations varied relatively little across the six-year period, 
suggesting that, like ethylene, Mont Belvieu propylene emissions have changed little or not at all, 
on average, across the study period. 
 
Figure 5-27:  Geometric Mean Propylene Concentration at Western Houston Ship Channel 
Monitors shows mean propylene concentrations by wind direction at the three western Houston 
Ship Channel monitors.  Patterns depicted here exhibit strong similarities to those seen with 
ethylene in this area:  the largest propylene source areas are to the east, and judging from the 
disappearance of strong peaks from 2006 onward, emissions from the now-defunct olefins plant 
located in the Houston Milby Park (A169) area were probably affecting these monitors.

5.3.8  Ambient Total VOC Concentrations  
Considerable research has focused on patterns and trends in HRVOC concentrations in the HGB 
area (Hafner Main et al. 2001; Brown and Hafner Main, 2002; Jolly et al., 2003; Fang and 
McDowell, 2003).  Less examined are patterns for other, less-reactive VOC.  This section 
presents a detailed examination of patterns in total VOC concentrations in the HGB area, using 
concentrations of total nonmethane hydrocarbons (TNMHC) as a measure of total VOC.  Each 
TNMHC measurement corresponds to the sum of all chromatogram peaks (identified and 
unidentified) from the start to the end of sample collection.  TNMHC is a useful measure of total 
VOC because it has been calculated in a consistent manner over the entire study period, unlike 
other parameters, such as the sum of Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) 
target compounds, whose constituents have changed periodically.   
 
Similar to the first HRVOC analysis presented in this section, geometric mean TNMHC 
concentrations, by monitor, year, and month, were calculated for valid months for all available 
data from each of the 12 HGB monitors.  Further analysis of the four non-Houston Ship Channel-
area monitors has not been completed at this time. 
 
Figure 5-28:  Monthly Geometric Mean TNMHC Concentrations, July 1995 through December 
2008 shows, for each of the eight Houston Ship Channel monitors, monthly geometric mean 
TNMHC concentration for all months with complete data, between the start of monitoring and 
December 2008.  Monitors are sorted according to their location from west (top) to east (bottom); 
the grey bars denote the 25th through 75th percentile concentrations (85 ppbC and 149 ppbC 
respectively) of all valid months across all monitors. 
 
As with ethylene and propylene, the two monitors with data before 2001, Clinton (CAMS 
403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) and Deer Park (CAMS 35/139), recorded their highest monthly 
geometric mean values before 2001.  Both monitors exhibited overall decreases across their 
respective data collection periods.  A statistical analysis of possible trends, using ordinary least 
squares regression, is presented in Table 5-19:  Parameter Estimates of Monthly Geometric Mean 
TNMHC Concentration Trends Houston Ship Channel Area Auto-GC Monitors.  This statistical 
model indicates that all 12 monitors had decreasing monthly mean concentrations, from the 
beginning to the end of each monitor’s respective data range.  As well, this model indicates that 
eight of the 12 monitors’ decreases were statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence 
level.

Figure 5-29:  90th Percentile TNMHC Concentration in the HGB Area presents 90th percentile 
TNMHC concentrations at each auto-GC monitor.  The area-wide 90th percentile TNMHC 
concentrations and the 90th percentile TNMHC at most of the individual monitors are decreasing.  
Smaller decreases are evident at Wallisville Road (CAMS 617), Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 
115), Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016), Mustang Bayou (CAMS 619), and Danciger (CAMS 618), 
while larger decreases are observed primarily at monitors closer to the Houston Ship Channel.  
Monitors in Brazoria County (Danciger (CAMS 618), Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016), and Mustang 
Bayou (CAMS 619)) and Galveston County (Texas City 34th St. (CAMS 620)) tend to report 
lower 90th percentile TNMHC than monitors located in Harris County.  In the past, Clinton 
(CAMS 403/CAMS 113/CAMS 304) has recorded the highest TNMHC concentrations, but since 
2006 Clinton has decreased at a faster rate and Channelview (CAMS 15/CAMS 115) has 
recorded the highest concentrations.

5.3.9  Meteorologically Adjusted Ozone Trends 
Ozone formation is dependent not only on its precursors (NOX and VOC), but also on 
meteorological variables.  While trends in ozone design values have been decreasing, design 
value trends must be examined to determine if the values are decreasing due to emission controls 
or if they are decreasing simply because of meteorological conditions in the area in the past 
several years.  To determine whether control strategies have been effective, meteorological 
influences must be removed from ozone trends.  Analysis done by Sullivan (2009) used a 
generalized linear model to account for meteorological influences in ozone trends.  The following 
discussion is based upon Sullivan (2009), who used a modified version of the Camalier et al. 
(2007) technique for removing the meteorological influences from the ozone trends. 
 
Before meteorological influences can be removed from ozone trends, the meteorological factors 
that are most important to ozone formation must first be identified.  Various correlations and 
factor analyses were used to identify the most important meteorological variables for ozone 
formation in the HGB area.  Data from the Omnibus Meteorological Database (METDAT) 
maintained by the EPA was compared to ozone data obtained from surface monitors in the HGB 
area.  Because the set of observed ozone levels can be influenced by the number of monitors in an 
area, Sullivan (2009) used a consistent set of ozone monitors in the HGB area.  These monitors 
are listed in Table 5-20:  Area Ozone Monitoring Sites with Long-Term Data.  Most contain a 
consistent set of data from 1990 to 2007.  Data from monitors that were moved a short distance 
during the period from 1990 to 2007 were combined with data from monitors in nearby locations, 
for example, data at Clute (CAMS 11) were combined with data from Lake Jackson (CAMS 
1016).

Figure 5-30:  Actual Mean Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations (Blue Line) and Mean Eight-Hour 
Predicted Concentrations with the Non-Meteorological Trend Removed (Red Line), which was 
reproduced from Sullivan (2009), displays two time series.  The values in blue represent the 
observed mean daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentrations; values in red represent the daily 
peak ozone based purely on the meteorological variations, with the non-meteorological factors 
removed.  In other words, the statistical model described above has been used to re-create the 
ozone time series with only the meteorology taken into account.   
 
For 2006 and 2007, the statistical model predicts that the observed mean daily peak eight-hour 
ozone should have been higher than observed, based upon the conduciveness of the meteorology 
toward ozone formation.  In other words, based on the weather, ozone concentrations should have 
been higher in 2006 and 2007.  Subtracting the meteorologically-based eight-hour ozone 
estimates from the actual eight-hour ozone results in a trend with the meteorological effects 
removed (Figure 5-31:  Residual Meteorologically Adjusted Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations 
Trend).  This trend represents how the sum of anthropogenic factors, model error, and 
undiagnosed meteorological factors have changed from 1996 to 2007.  Figure 5-31:  Residual 
Meteorologically Adjusted Eight-Hour Ozone Concentrations Trend, which was reproduced from 
Sullivan et al., 2009, represents the trend in peak daily maximum ozone with the meteorological 
factors removed.  The meteorologically-adjusted ozone trend is clearly downward.  Since the 
meteorological variations have been removed, this downward trend shows the effect of emission 
reductions in the HGB area.  Statistical results of this analysis are listed in Table 5-21:  Summary 
Statistics for Meteorologically Adjusted Ozone Trends from 1996 to 2007.  The slope of -0.86 
shows that eight-hour ozone trends in the HGB area are decreasing and that they are significant 
(p-value = 0.00).

The analysis from Sullivan (2009) shows that, after adjusting for meteorology, concentrations of 
ozone has declined substantially in the HGB area.  All else held equal, daily maximum eight-hour 
ozone concentrations in the HGB area should be around 9 ppb lower in 2007 compared to 1996. 
 
5.3.10  Background Ozone Concentrations:  Transport of Ozone into the HGB Area 
Estimating the levels of ozone transported into the HGB area is important in order to identify so 
that the amount of locally produced ozone.  Several researchers have previously investigated the 
background ozone concentrations in Texas and the transport winds that are associated with them.  
Nielsen-Gammon et al. (2005) investigated background ozone from 1998-2003 in the HGB area 
and obtained the following insights (paraphrased from Nielsen-Gammon et al., 2005): 
 
• 
The seasonal variability in eight-hour maximum ozone in eastern Texas is primarily 
associated with background ozone. Local contributions tend to be highest during the 
summer when background ozone reaches a minimum. 
• 
The late spring peak in eight-hour maximum ozone in eastern Texas is primarily 
associated with “tropospheric background” ozone. This ozone maximum has been 
observed at rural sites elsewhere and is associated with variations in the lifetime of 
ozone, the concentrations of NOx, and enhanced transport from the stratosphere. 
• 
The midsummer minimum in background ozone in eastern Texas leads to a minimum in 
eight-hour peak ozone that is strongest in southeastern Texas and barely noticeable in 
northeastern Texas. The primary cause of the summertime minimum is a decline in the 
tropospheric background ozone. Although the relatively clean southerly flow is 
weakening during this period, most air parcel paths remain maritime in nature. 
• 
When easterly and northeasterly winds become more frequent in late summer, 
background ozone and total ozone in eastern Texas begin rising.  Winds are also less 
steady than in the middle of summer, so continental transport becomes increasingly 
frequent. 
 
Langford et al. (2009) showed that the techniques used by Nielsen-Gammon et al. (2005) yielded 
results consistent with a different technique of estimating background, except on some occasions 
when the Galveston Airport (CAMS 34/CAMS 109/CAMS 154) site was chosen as the 
background site.  Langford et al. showed that the Galveston site is the site most strongly affected 
by the Gulf breeze, and that on some days, the maritime air from the Gulf does not affect the 
Houston area, even though this air affects Galveston.  Hardesty et al. (2007) have shown that 
during the TexAQS II study in August through September 2006, background ozone in southeast 
Texas averaged about 50 ppb, with background concentrations lower near the coast, and higher in 
northeast Texas.  On one day, September 8, 2006, the background ozone entering Texas from east 
was 85-90 ppb.  The results of these studies have shown that background ozone entering 
southeast Texas can have a large effect on the total observed eight-hour ozone concentrations.  To 
investigate the role of background ozone for the most recent years, the TCEQ commissioned a 
study of background ozone and its relationship to larger-scale wind patterns.  Below is a 
description of this work. 

 
 
5-64
 
Sullivan (2009) used 72-hour back trajectories calculated with the Hybrid Single Particle 
Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) algorithm, using data from the Ecosystem 
Dynamics and the Atmosphere Section (EDAS) meteorological model to estimate the amount of 
ozone entering into the HGB area.  A total of 1,456 backward trajectories were run starting at 
12:00 Central Standard Time in central Houston, at 300 meters above ground level, during the 
peak of ozone season in the HGB area (May 1 through October 31, 2000 to 2007).  Analysis of 
multiple trajectories can distinguish between source areas, or paths, that lead to higher than 
average, or lower than average ozone concentrations (Sullivan et al., 2009).  A clustering 
algorithm was used to group multiple trajectories based on trajectory size and shape.  Six 
identified clusters appear in Figure 5-32:  Six Clusters Found Using HYSPLIT Backward 
Trajectory Clustering Algorithm, which was reproduced from Sullivan, 2009.  Forty backward 
trajectories that did not end up in any of the six clusters, illustrated in Figure 5-33:  Cluster 0 
Backward Trajectories, reproduced from Sullivan (2009), were grouped and assigned a cluster 
number of zero.  All but one of the back trajectories in cluster zero originate from the south and 
that these trajectories appear to extend beyond the EDAS modeling domain, which is the only 
difference between cluster zero and cluster two.

Figure 5-32:  Six Clusters Found Using HYSPLIT Backward Trajectory Clustering Algorithm 
shows that cluster one and cluster two represent days in which winds originated from the Gulf of 
Mexico; these trajectories typically represent cleaner air coming from the Gulf of Mexico and 
hence lower observed ozone concentrations in the HGB area.  Cluster three represents long 
trajectories, which come into the HGB area from the north as far away as Canada.  This type of 
trajectory can also bring clean air from northern states and Canada into the HGB area.  Cluster 
four represents stagnant air conditions, a frequent cause of ozone accumulation.  Cluster five 
shows trajectories that originate from the northeast, in the Ohio River Valley, that bring polluted 
air from more populated areas into the HGB area.  Cluster six illustrates trajectories from the east, 
some of which cross over Louisiana and the Beaumont-Port Arthur (BPA) area and some of 
which cross over the Gulf of Mexico.  The mean centerline from each of the six clusters is shown 
in Figure 5-34:  Means of Six 60-Hour Backward Trajectory Clusters.  Trajectories were 
compared to ozone concentrations in the HGB area to quantify how these trajectories are related 
to ozone in the HGB area.

Twelve ozone sites, shown in Figure 5-35:  Sites Used in Ozone Area Maximum and Background 
Determination, that had near continuous operation from 2000 to 2007 in the HGB area were 
selected to compare with trajectory clusters.  In an effort to use measurements from a consistent, 
long-term set of monitors, data from sites that were shut down were combined with data from 
sites that began collecting data near the sites that were taken off-line.  Sites where data were 
combined are Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016) and Clute (CAMS 11), and Galveston Airport (CAMS 
34/CAMS 109/CAMS 154) and Galveston Airport 99th St. (CAMS 1034).  Sites were selected 
based on locations as either a site upwind or downwind of the HGB area.  Northwest Harris 
County (CAMS 26), the Lake Jackson (CAMS 1016) / Clute (CAMS 11) combined site pair, and 
the Galveston Airport (CAMS 34/CAMS 109/CAMS 154)/ Galveston 99th St. (CAMS 1034) 
combined site pair generally represent sites measuring background ozone concentrations.  Sites 
on the downwind side of downtown Houston and the Houston Ship Channel generally represent 
sites measuring maximum ozone concentrations in the HGB area.  Maximum peak and minimum 
peak eight-hour ozone concentrations from the twelve monitors were found for each day, then 
merged with the cluster classification from each day.  Following Nielson-Gammon et al. (2005), 
that minimum peak eight-hour average ozone concentration was used to represent the 
“background” ozone level in the HGB Area.

Table 5-22:  Ozone Statistics for HYSPLIT Back Trajectory Clusters summarizes average 
maximum and average minimum, or background, ozone concentrations for each cluster.  Average 
maximum peak daily eight-hour ozone among the clusters ranges from 40.6 ppb to 73.3 ppb, 
while average minimum peak daily eight-hour ozone, considered a proxy for background ozone 
concentrations, ranges from 21.4 ppb to 45.1 ppb.  The difference between these two means can 
be used as a surrogate for locally produced ozone.  Cluster four and cluster five, which represent 
the short fetch and the northeast fetch, have the highest average maximum ozone concentrations, 
71.6 ppb and 73.3 ppb, respectively, and the highest average background, 40.8 ppb and 45.1 ppb.  
These two clusters also exhibit some of the largest average differences or local contributions.  
Cluster zero, the far southeast cluster, cluster one, the east southeast cluster, and cluster two, the 
southeast cluster, exhibited some of the lowest average background and average peak ozone; 
these clusters are expected to have a lower background ozone due to their origins over the Gulf of 
Mexico.

* May not sum due to rounding.  Note:  Data is May through October, 2000 to 2007.  Fetch 
represents the main direction of the cluster, count is the number of back trajectories in each 
cluster, average minimum peak daily eight-hour ozone is taken as the background ozone 
concentration. Clusters are sorted in descending order by average maximum peak daily eight-hour 
ozone. 
 
The 95 percent confidence intervals for the mean eight-hour ozone maximum for each cluster are 
shown in Table 5-23:  Average Maximum Ozone and 95 Percent Confidence Intervals.  Two 
standard errors were used for the confidence intervals in each row.  The confidence intervals in 
the table show that differences between means are statistically significant for most of the pair-
wise comparison.  This is shown graphically in Figure 5-36:  Average Maximum Ozone and 95 
Percent Confidence Intervals.  Fetches originating from the northeast and east, as well as the 
“short” fetch, have the highest average peak daily ozone values, and they are tightly clustered.  
Clusters originating from the north and far southeast have noticeably wider confidence intervals, 
indicating more variability, but with lower average peak daily ozone concentrations than the 
northeast and east clusters.

Note: Confidence intervals were constructed using two standard errors.  Clusters are sorted in 
descending order by average maximum peak daily eight-hour ozone.  Confidence intervals for 
differences between the area ozone maximums generally do not overlap beyond one or two rows. 
 
 
Although many of the selected sites were intended to represent background and maximum ozone 
in the HGB area, note that on many days true background ozone concentrations may be observed 

 
 
5-70
farther away, in more rural areas, and the true maximum ozone concentration may also be 
underestimated.  Despite uncertainty in estimates of true background and maximum ozone 
concentrations, the large number of observations used in this analysis, as well as evidence 
presented earlier, provide clear evidence that ozone in the HGB area is affected by transport of 
ozone from external sources.

Figure 5-37:  Relationship Between Minimum and Maximum Ozone Concentrations, recreated 
from Sullivan (2009), shows there is a significant linear relationship between mean HGB area 
minimum and maximum eight-hour average ozone concentrations by trajectory cluster (p-value < 
0.01).  The dark red points and estimated regression line represent the relationship between mean 
maximum ozone and mean minimum (background) ozone concentrations by cluster.  The olive 
points and estimated regression line represent the relationship between “local contribution” 
(difference between maximum and minimum) and mean minimum ozone concentrations by 
cluster.  The relationship between maximum and minimum ozone by cluster suggests that 
trajectory direction is a factor determining severity of both HGB area maximum and background 
ozone concentrations (Sullivan, 2009).  The estimated slope parameter (β = 1.36) of the ordinary 
least squares regression of average minimum ozone concentration against average maximum 
ozone concentration shows that maximum ozone concentration increases at a greater rate with 
trajectory direction when compared to minimum ozone.

Figure 5-37:  Relationship Between Minimum and Maximum Ozone Concentrations 
 
 
Figure 5-37:  Relationship Between Minimum and Maximum Ozone Concentrations also shows 
that the difference between mean HGB area maximum and minimum ozone concentrations is also 
roughly linear with area minimum, but with a lower slope (β=0.36) and lesser statistical 
significance (p-value=0.03) (Sullivan, 2009).  The linear relationship between the difference and 
mean HGB area minimum ozone suggests the transport direction also affects local ozone 
production.  The slower air movement of cluster four, which is the “short” cluster, allows greater 
accumulation in the area under lower local surface wind speeds.  Winds originating from the 
directions of cluster six, the “east” cluster, and cluster five, the “northeast” cluster, help to move 
surface air along the area around the Houston Ship Channel and across the downtown Houston 
area, which, as noted, contain large amounts of ozone precursors.  Overall, this analysis shows 
that directions of back trajectories can account for up to 24 ppb of variation in background ozone 
concentrations, and up to 35 ppb of variation in maximum ozone concentrations. 
 
5.3.11  Transport and Surface Wind Trajectories 
While still incomplete, a preliminary analysis of upper level, or transport, wind trajectories was 
conducted to confirm and extend findings from the previously discussed directional analysis.  
Additional HYSPLIT modeling of 48-hour back trajectories at 1,500 meters altitude for May 
through August, 2000 to 2008, was used to detect difference in trajectories across years that may 
have influenced ozone concentrations in the HGB area.   
 
A simple visual inspection of the densities of distributions of trajectory end points presented in 
Figure 5-38:  Distributions of End Points from HYSPLIT 48-Hour Back Trajectories shows that 
upper level wind patterns for 2008, a year which had relatively low ozone concentrations, do not 
noticeably differ from patterns in other years.  Of the years analyzed, the pattern for 2000, a year 
with relatively high levels of ozone, is perhaps the most similar to 2008.  The spatial distribution 
is similar among years and wind speeds are also similar.  Higher wind speeds are evident in 2004 
and 2005, as implied by trajectories with longer fetches.  The implication is that the wind patterns 

 
 
5-72
observed during 2008 were not responsible for the lower ozone concentrations observed, since 
high ozone was observed during other years that had wind patterns similar to 2008.

5.3.12  Background Ozone in Texas 
Research on the meteorology of the HGB area has found that the highest background ozone 
transported into the HGB area predominately originates from the north and northeast (Nielson-
Gammon et al., 2005).   In the present analysis, two techniques are used to examine background 
ozone concentrations in Texas since 2000.  The first technique examines the trend in ozone 
concentrations at four sites that can be considered background sites under certain flow conditions.  
The second technique examines ozone concentrations associated with different patterns of long-
term backward trajectories. 
 
Identifying appropriate background ozone monitoring sites from which to ascertain trends is 
complicated by local ozone, complex wind patterns, and natural variability in background ozone 
itself.  To estimate background ozone, Nielson-Gammon et al. evaluated all monitors in the 
region to identify those that could be considered to be recording background ozone values.  They 
proposed a modification of a TCEQ procedure to identify such sites.   
 
The TCEQ procedure involves determining the direction of transport winds, then selecting a rural 
monitor upwind of the area in that direction.  Nielson-Gammon et al. simply select as the 
background value the lowest of the peak eight-hour ozone values from all monitors.  Unlike the 

 
 
5-73
Nielson-Gammon procedure, which used gridded output of a meteorological model, this analysis 
follows the TCEQ approach using direct measurements of surface winds and tracking background 
ozone concentrations over time at selected monitors.  Modifying the Nielson-Gammon procedure, 
the approach presented here identifies the 90th percentile values recorded at the selected monitors 
and examines the distribution of daily maximum ozone concentrations over time to determine 
whether these supposed background concentrations have increased or decreased.  Both the 
Nielson-Gammon method and the TCEQ method may not strictly estimate background ozone, as 
defined above, because they do not remove any potential recirculation of pollutants generated via 
local emissions.  Also, background ozone alone may not tell the complete story, since ozone 
precursors, which can react with each other and with local emissions to produce ozone, may also 
be present in transported air. 
 
Four candidate monitors were selected for this analysis and are listed in Table 5-24:  Monitors 
Selected for Background Transport Analysis.  Two monitors, West Orange (CAMS 9) and 
Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665), are located east of the HGB area, adjacent to 
the Texas-Louisiana border, east of the BPA area; one, Karnack (CAMS 85), is located in 
northeast Texas near the Texas-Louisiana-Arkansas border and the Tyler-Longview-Marshall 
(TLM) area; and one, Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654), is located east of the HGB area, 
between the HGB area and the BPA area.  Each of these monitors was selected for specific 
purposes.  West Orange (CAMS 9) and Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) were 
chosen because they are as close as possible to the Texas border and, thus, are useful for isolating 
background ozone being transported into the state from the east.  Karnack (CAMS 85), in 
northeast Texas, is also very near the Texas border, and was selected to provide an assessment of 
background ozone transport from more northerly regions.  The final site, Hamshire (CAMS 
64/CAMS 654), was selected to aid stratification of background ozone being transported into the 
HGB area into a component originating outside the state, and a component contributed by the 
BPA area.

Source:  TCEQ/LEADS database.  Data with wind speeds less than 3 miles per hour were 
excluded to minimize influences from periods of stagnation which may result in over estimation 
of background concentrations. 
 
To isolate ozone being transported into the state, measurements at the selected monitors were 
restricted by wind direction.  The West Orange (CAMS 9) monitor is located less than 3 miles 
from the Louisiana border but is near several industrial sites.  Only ozone measurements taken 
when winds originated from directions ranging from 30° to 90° (Figure 5-39:  Mauriceville 
C642/C311/C665) and West Orange (C9) Monitors) were considered, to minimize possible 
influence from these sources. Thirty degrees corresponds to a north-northeast direction and 90o is 
due east.  The Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) monitor is located ten miles 
from the Louisiana border, north of the West Orange (CAMS 9) monitor.  This site may have 
some minor influence from relatively small NOX and VOC sources.  Data from this monitor was 
restricted to wind directions originating from 30° to 90°, similarly to West Orange (CAMS 9), to 
minimize any possible influence of nearby point sources. 
 
The Karnack (CAMS 85) monitor in the TLM area is located eight miles from the Texas-
Louisiana border, and roughly 20 miles from Arkansas.  Measurements from Karnack (CAMS 
85) were restricted to wind directions originating from 30° to 135° (Figure 5-40:  Karnack 
C85Monitor), that is, from north-northeast clockwise to southeast.  Though this site is not near 

 
 
5-74
the HGB area, it records large influxes of continental air transported from the Midwestern United 
States into Texas, which ultimately may raise background ozone concentrations throughout the 
state.  Also, estimates of background ozone concentrations from Karnack (CAMS 85) can be 
compared to background estimates from West Orange (CAMS 9) and Mauriceville (CAMS 
642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665), which is useful for corroborating estimates at these two sites, and 
determining the range of background ozone entering the state. 
 
The final site under consideration is Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654), located between the HGB 
area and the BPA area.  Ozone measurements from this site can be used to estimate background 
ozone concentrations transported to the HGB area when winds are from the east.  These 
background ozone measurements are a combination of pollution transported into Texas, as well as 
the contribution of pollution from the BPA area.  To avoid undue influence of nearby industrial 
sites, similar to Karnack (CAMS 85), data from Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654) are restricted 
to measurements obtained when winds originate from directions ranging from 30° to 135°.  For 
the four monitors, monthly 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th   percentiles of hourly ozone 
concentrations were calculated for the spring and summer ozone season, May through September, 
2000 through 2008, except Karnack (CAMS 85) which only has data since 2001.  These values 
are plotted in Figure 5-42:  Selected Statistics for the West Orange C9 Monitor, Figure 5-43:  
Selected Statistics for the Mauriceville C642/C311/C665 Monitor, Figure 5-44:  Selected 
Statistics for the Karnack C85 Monitor, and Figure 5-45:  Selected Statistics for the Hamshire 
C64/C654 Monitor.  Ninetieth percentile values are reported in Table 5-25:  Range of Monthly 
90th Percentile Daily Peak Hourly Ozone Concentrations for Subject Wind Directions.

Note:  Though data has been restricted by wind direction to mitigate influences 
from nearby pollution sources, there may be unknown influences that are 
unaccounted for.  Maximum values for each year are highlighted in boldface 
type. 
 
 
To statistically verify whether a trend across time exists in the data, an index of date was fit to the 
daily peak values using ordinary least squares regression.  Additional regressions were performed 
using an index of month against the selected percentiles of the monthly distributions.  The 
resulting parameter estimates from these models revealed no statistically significant trend at the 5 
percent significance level; however, the data likely suffer from autocorrelation, a problem 
common to time series data.  Time series data are often not independent, but correlated with 
themselves across time, which complicates formal statistical estimation by biasing parameter 
estimates. 
 
Rather than performing the procedures necessary to detect, measure, and correct for 
autocorrelation, a careful visual inspection of time series plots, presented in Figure 5-42:  Selected 
Statistics for the West Orange C9 Monitor through Figure 5-45:  Selected Statistics for the 
Hamshire C64/C654 Monitor, satisfies that no time trend is perceptible.  These four figures plot 
the five selected percentiles of the monthly distributions at each monitor.  While no trend is 
detectable, what is apparent is that ozone concentrations measured at these monitors, which have 
been restricted in such a way as to proxy background levels, vary substantially.  Background 
ozone at these monitors varies as much as 35 ppb, due to meteorological effects and ozone 
dynamics occurring in upwind regions. 
 
Notable in Figure 5-45:  Selected Statistics for the Hamshire C64/C654 Monitor, hourly ozone 
concentrations at Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654) behave similarly to West Orange (CAMS 9) 
and Karnack (CAMS 85), in that there is no observable or statistically significant trend of the 
median or 90th percentile values.  The 90th percentile value at Hamshire (CAMS 64/CAMS 654), 
considering directionally restricted data for May to September, 2000 through 2008, is 59 ppb.  
This value is in the range of values computed by Nielson-Gammon using different procedures; 
however, the 90th percentile can exceed 80 ppb at any of the sites, and even exceeded 90 ppb at 
Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) in 2000.  TexAQS II also found background 

 
 
5-78
ozone concentrations that exceed the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS (TexAQS II Rapid Science 
Synthesis Team 2006). 
 
Over the 2000 through 2008 period, the maximum 90th percentile one-hour ozone concentrations 
at West Orange (CAMS 9) and Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) are 79 and 92, 
respectively.  The maximum 90th percentile for Karnack (CAMS 85) over the 2001 through 2008 
period is 81.  Karnack (CAMS 85) appears to consistently measure a higher background than 
either West Orange (CAMS 9) or Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665).  These 
results are consistent with estimates reported by Nielson-Gammon, et al. (2005), which also 
found higher background ozone concentrations during the ozone season in northeast Texas than 
in the HGB area. 
 
Regression analysis was used to determine whether the 90th percentile values at West Orange 
(CAMS 9) and Mauriceville (CAMS 642/CAMS 311/CAMS 665) track one another, which 
suggests they are measuring roughly equivalent phenomena.  The resulting R2 of 0.78, which is 
significant at a probability level less than 0.1 percent (Table 5-26:  Parameter Estimates for 
Regression of West Orange C9 on Mauriceville C642/C311/C665, indicates very strong 
correlation between measurements at the two sites.  The scatter plot of the data is illustrated in 
Figure 5-46:  Scatter-plot of 90th Percentile Hourly Values at West Orange C9 and Mauriceville 
C642/C311/C665.  The values in the scatter plot are from May through September, 2000 to 2008.  
The scatter plot supports the contention that these two monitors are measuring roughly the same 
phenomena, under wind-restricted regimes.

In summary, none of the four sites used for estimating background ozone concentrations recorded 
a statistically significant trend.  The Karnack (CAMS 85) monitoring site recorded the highest 
90th percentile measurement of the four background sites, with 90th percentile ozone 
concentrations reaching as high as 63 ppb.  Since it is farthest from the HGB area, however, the 
HGB area may not be strongly affected by the ozone observed at this site, at least not on the same 
day.   
 
5.3.13  Air Quality Trends Conclusions 
Ozone concentrations have decreased dramatically in the HGB area since the 1990s.  
Examination of trends in one-hour ozone, eight-hour ozone, the number of exceedances, the 
spatial distribution of ozone, the seasonal distribution of ozone, and the strength of ozone 
gradients all show substantial downward trends.  The causes of the trends were investigated by 
examining the meteorological variations that have occurred over the years, by evaluating the local 
changes in ozone precursor concentrations, and by examining trends in background ozone.  The 
analyses found that the interannual meteorological variations cannot explain the observed 
decreases in ozone, and that the ozone precursors are on statistically significant downward trends.  
In addition, the analyses have found that background ozone has not dropped substantially since 
2000, suggesting that the significant ozone reductions in the HGB area are due to local emission 
controls, not due to background ozone decreases. 
 
5.4  QUALITATIVE CORROBORATIVE ANALYSIS 
5.4.1  Introduction 
Because photochemical modeling is an evaluation tool and not an absolute prediction of future 
ozone concentrations, additional data must be considered in order to draw conclusions about the 
validity of the final predicted design value and whether the attainment demonstration satisfies the 
requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA).  The EPA’s “Guidance on the Use of Models 

 
 
5-80
and Other Analyses for Demonstrating Attainment of Air Quality Goals for Ozone, PM2.5, and 
Regional Haze,” referenced as modeling guidance in Chapter 3, Photochemical Modeling 
acknowledges that many issues cannot be accurately quantified and therefore cannot be properly 
included in the photochemical modeling demonstration.  The qualitative corroborative analysis 
contains information regarding federal preemption issues and analysis of additional measures that 
were not included in the modeling. 
 
5.4.2  Federal Preemption Issues 
The TCEQ has limited authority to regulate certain components of the emissions inventory.  The 
federal government has jurisdiction over on-road and non-road vehicles, ships, locomotives, and 
aircraft, among other sources.  Since states cannot control sources that are under federal 
jurisdiction or located in other states, the state is limited in its ability to impose controls on all of 
the sources that contribute to ozone formation in a nonattainment area. 
 
5.4.2.1  Federal Assignment 
While these categories have been addressed through expeditiously implemented state incentive 
programs such as the Low Income Vehicle Repair Assistance, Retrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle 
Retirement Program (LIRAP) and the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP), future reductions 
are dependent on the prompt implementation of new federal engine and fuel standards for on-road 
and non-road vehicles, ships, locomotives, and aircraft. 
 
5.4.3  Additional Measures 
5.4.3.1  New International Marine Diesel Engine and Marine Fuel Standards for Oceangoing 
Vessels and Emissions Control Areas 
In October 2008, the United States ratified the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 
adoption of the amendments to Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of 
Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) for new international marine diesel engine and marine fuel 
standards for oceangoing vessels (OGV).  The new Annex VI Tier II and Tier III emission 
standards will apply to diesel engines with a power rating above 130 kilowatts (kW) (i.e., 175 
horsepower) installed on marine vessels constructed on or after January 1, 2011 (Tier II), and 
January 1, 2016 (Tier III), or diesel engines above 130 kW that undergo a major conversion on or 
after those dates.  The revised MARPOL Annex VI will become effective on July 1, 2010. 
 
In March 2009, the United States submitted a request to the IMO for the creation of an emissions 
control area (ECA) around the nation's coastlines.  If the ECA is granted, all marine diesel fuels 
used by OGV in the ECA will be limited to a maximum sulfur content of 1,000 ppm beginning 
January 1, 2015, and all new engines on OGV operating in these areas must use emission controls 
that achieve an 80 percent reduction in NOX emissions beginning January 1, 2016.  Table 5-27:  
New MARPOL Annex VI Emission Standards for Marine Diesel Engines lists the new emission 
standards for marine diesel engines with greater than 30 liter per cylinder displacement.

Note:  NOX emission standards presented in grams per kilowatt hour.   
 
In the August 28, 2009, issue of the Federal Register (74 FR 44442), the EPA proposed 
rulemaking to adopt new federal Tier 2 and Tier 3 engine standards for new marine engines above 
30 liters per cylinder displacement (i.e., Category 3 marine diesel engines) that are consistent 
with the new MARPOL Annex VI NOX emission standards shown in Table 5-27:  New MARPOL 
Annex VI Emission Standards for Marine Diesel Engines.  The EPA's proposed new Category 3 
marine diesel engine standards also include new standards limiting the emissions of hydrocarbons 
and carbon monoxide from new Tier 2 and later Category 3 engines to 2.0 g/kW-hr and 5.0 
g/kW-hr, respectfully.   
 
The EPA regulations for marine diesel fuel and new marine engines less than 30 liters per 
cylinder displacement and the new MARPOL Annex VI standards for marine residual fuels and 
new marine diesel engines above 30 liters per cylinder displacement will apply to all OGV 
flagged and registered in the United States.  The EPA's proposed new regulations for new 
Category 3 marine engines and new sulfur limits for marine diesel fuel will also apply to all OGV 
flagged and registered in the United States.  In addition, the new MARPOL Annex VI standards 
will apply to all new marine diesel engines and fuels on foreign marine vessels that operate near 
United States coasts and ports.  
 
The new marine diesel engine and fuel standards will provide a 96 percent reduction in sulfur in 
marine diesel fuels, as well as an 85 percent reduction in particulate matter emissions and an 80 
percent reduction in NOX emissions, when compared to current standards (EPA, 2009a, 
http://www.epa.gov/otaq/oceanvessels.htm#emissioncontrol).  The cumulative effects of these 
new marine diesel engine and fuels standards will result in a 0.5 to 1.0 ppb reduction of ozone in 
the ambient air of the HGB ozone nonattainment area by 2020 (EPA, 2009b). 
 
5.4.3.2  SmartWay Transport Partnership and the Blue Skyways Collaborative 
Among its various efforts to improve air quality in Texas, the TCEQ is currently promoting two 
voluntary programs in cooperation with the EPA:  the SmartWay Transport Partnership and the 
Blue Skyways Collaborative. 
 
The SmartWay Transport Partnership is a voluntary EPA program for the freight transport 
industry that promotes strategies and technologies to help improve fleet efficiency while also 
reducing air emissions.  Fleets participating in the SmartWay Transport Partnership commit to 
implementing voluntary measures over three years, providing the EPA with annual updates of 
their progress throughout that period.  
 
SmartWay carriers typically commit to integrating fuel-saving strategies and technologies into 
their fleet including:  improved aerodynamics, single-wide tires, lighter wheels and rims, idle 
reduction, automatic tire inflation systems, driver training, and advanced powertrain technologies.   
 

 
 
5-82
Rolling resistance is estimated by the EPA to account for as much as 13 percent of a heavy-duty 
vehicle’s fuel consumption.  By reducing rolling resistance, as well as vehicle weight, the EPA 
believes that single-wide tires will help to improve fuel economy and reduce NOX emissions by 
an average of 5 percent.   Aerodynamic drag accounts for most of a long-haul truck’s energy 
losses at highway speeds.  As a result, the EPA estimates that improving the aerodynamics of 
both a long-haul truck and its trailer can help to improve fuel economy and reduce NOX 
emissions by another 5 percent.   
 
The extended periods of idling typically associated with long-haul trucks consume an average of 
one gallon of fuel per hour, while generating associated emissions.  New technologies such as 
auxiliary power units (APU) and truck stop electrification (TSE) systems reduce vehicle idling by 
providing power for air conditioning, heating, and onboard electrical accessories, even when the 
vehicle is not in operation.   The EPA estimates that, assuming typical idling levels, idling 
reduction technologies such as APU and TSE can reduce NOX emissions by approximately 10 
percent. 
 
The transient nature of freight transportation makes it difficult to isolate emissions reductions to a 
certain region or even a certain state.  As a result, any estimates of the impact of these 
technologies will largely rely on estimates of accumulated reductions based on estimated levels of 
overall fleet integration.  These estimates are possible through ongoing research, and in 
conjunction with the more than 2,000 companies nationwide already committed as SmartWay 
partners, the EPA has identified a variety of technologies and the potential fuel savings and 
emissions reductions from those technologies.  There are 87 Texas companies that are currently 
SmartWay partners. 
 
The Blue Skyways Collaborative is a related effort, spearheaded by the EPA Region 6 office in 
Dallas, Texas and the Region 7 office in Kansas City, Missouri.   
 
Partnering with the EPA Region 6 and Region 7 through this effort are the environmental and 
energy agencies from the 10 states along the Interstate Highway 35 (IH-35) corridor, including 
Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, and 
Minnesota.  In implementing the Blue Skyways Collaborative, the EPA and the participating 
states recognize that because air quality is often a regional concern, greater reductions are 
possible through cooperative efforts as opposed to individual efforts initiated independently in 
each state.   
 
The primary objective of the Blue Skyways Collaborative is to improve air quality in these states 
by promoting innovative technologies in a variety of sectors.  In addition to promoting reduction 
strategies through the SmartWay Partnership for freight transportation via air, water, and rail, 
Blue Skyways also focuses on promoting emissions reduction strategies for other on-road 
sources, non-road sources, and highway fueling and idling reduction infrastructure, while also 
promoting renewable, efficient, and alternative energy sources.   
 
To achieve these objectives, the collaborative develops partnerships among international, federal, 
state, and local governments, as well as non-profit organizations, environmental groups, and 
private industries.  These partnerships work together in projects along the key transportation 
corridors by sharing emission reduction technologies and leveraging financial resources from a 
variety of sources.

5.4.3.3  Control of VOC Emissions from Flash Emissions 
When the TCEQ and its research partners began the second Texas air quality study, TexAQS II, 
in May 2005, one of the study’s primary goals was to identify VOC emission sources that have 
been historically underestimated, unreported, or underreported in the TCEQ emissions inventory 
and could potentially be contributing to a discrepancy between measured and reported emissions.  
TexAQS II remote sensing VOC project results indicate that certain types of storage tank 
emissions, including flash, generally have been underestimated, unreported, or underreported in 
the emission inventory.  Flash emissions occur when a liquid with entrained gases goes from a 
high pressure to a low pressure.  As the pressure on the liquid drops, some of the lighter VOC 
dissolved in the liquid are released or flashed.  Compounds that are liquids at the initial pressure 
may transform from a liquid into a vapor and are also released from the liquid.  As these gases are 
released, some of the heavier compounds in the liquids may become entrained in these gases and 
are emitted with the lighter VOC. 
 
In May 2007, the commission adopted rule amendments to 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 
Chapter 115, Subchapter B, Division 1 that revised the requirements for VOC storage tanks 
located in the HGB ozone nonattainment area. The revised requirements were developed to 
reduce VOC emissions that result from uncontrolled flash emissions at upstream oil and gas 
exploration and production sites and other sources of tank emissions.  At the time of the rule 
proposal, the amount of flash emissions from minor sources was unknown.    
 
A method for quantifying flash emissions became available around the same time.  Houston 
Advanced Research Center Project 51C, conducted in 2006, quantified emission rates from 
heater-treaters (separators) and storage tank batteries, including flash and condensate tanks, 
associated with the upstream oil and gas industry in the Dallas-Fort Worth and HGB ozone 
nonattainment areas, and Jefferson County.  In April 2007, the TCEQ used the results of this 
study to determine the flash emissions from the oil and gas production industry.  However, the 
flash emissions were not included in the 2005 area source periodic emissions inventory (PEI) 
because there was not sufficient time to incorporate the emissions before the 2005 area source 
PEI was submitted to the EPA in May 2007.  However, the updated 2005 area source emissions 
inventory is being used for this SIP revision.  More information on this study can be found at: 
http://www.harc.edu/Projects/AirQuality/Projects/Projects/H051C. 
 
The rule amendments adopted in May 2007 resulted in actual reductions to flash emissions but no 
credit is claimed in this SIP revision.  Crude and condensate storage tanks at upstream oil and gas 
exploration and production sites or midstream pipeline breakout stations with uncontrolled flash 
emissions greater than 25 tons per year (tpy) are controlled under the rule.  Since the method of 
calculating the emissions was based on county-level production, it is unknown at this time how 
many sites were over 25 tpy and were required to put on controls.  Also unknown is how much 
flash emissions were already controlled due to economic reasons.  Because of the unknown total 
effect of this rule, the reduction in flash emissions cannot be quantified at this time and is not 
included in the modeling for this SIP revision.  These amendments to Chapter 115 are described 
in more detail in the preamble of the adopted rule (Project Number 2006-038-115-EN). 
 
5.4.3.4  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE/RE) Measures 
Energy efficiency efforts are typically programs that reduce the amount of electricity and natural 
gas consumed by residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal energy consumers.  Examples 
of energy efficiency include increasing insulation in homes, installing compact fluorescent light 
bulbs, and replacing motors and pumps with high efficiency units.  Renewable energy efforts 
include programs that generate energy from resources that are replenished or are otherwise not 
consumed as with traditional fuel-based energy production.  Examples of renewable energy 
include wind energy and solar energy projects.

o HB 66 (Regular Session) 
o HB 3070 (Regular Session) 
o HB 3693 (Regular Session) 
o SB 12 (Regular Session) 
 
SB 5, 77th Texas Legislature, 2001, set goals for political subdivisions in affected counties to 
implement measures to reduce energy consumption from existing facilities by 5 percent each year 
for five years from January 1, 2002 through January 1, 2006.  In 2007, the 80th Texas Legislature 
passed SB 12, which extended the timeline set in SB 5 through 2007 and made the 5 percent each 
year a goal instead of a requirement.  The State Energy Conservation Office (SECO) is charged 
with tracking the implementation of SB 5 and SB 12.  Also during the 77th Texas Legislature, the 
Energy Systems Laboratory (ESL), part of the Texas Engineering Experiment Station, Texas 
A&M University System, was mandated to provide an annual report on EE/RE efforts in the state 
as part of the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP) under Texas Health and Safety Code 
(THSC), § 388.003(e).  HB 2129, 79th Texas Legislature, 2005, directed the ESL to collaborate 
with the TCEQ to develop a methodology for computing emission reductions attributable to use 
of renewable energy and for the ESL to quantify annually such emission reductions.  HB 2129 
directed the Texas Environmental Research Consortium to use the Texas Engineering Experiment 
Station to develop this methodology.  With the TCEQ’s guidance, the ESL produces an annual 
report detailing these efforts (Statewide Air Emissions Calculations from Energy Efficiency, Wind 
and Renewables).  The report: 
 
• 
analyzes power production from wind and other renewable energy sources;   
• 
provides quantification of energy savings and NOX reductions resulting from the 
installation of wind and other renewable energy sources; 
• 
describes methodologies developed to quantify energy savings and NOX reductions from 
energy efficiency, wind and other renewable energy initiatives; and 
• 
provides degradation analysis for future predictions of power production of wind farms. 
 
The ESL documents methods used to develop estimates of energy savings and NOX emissions 
reductions resulting from reductions in natural gas consumption and displaced power from 
conventional electric generation facilities.  The ESL used the EPA’s Emissions and Generation 
Resource Integrated Database to spatially allocate energy use and emission reductions among 
electric generation facilities.  The THSC, § 389.002 and § 389.003 contain requirements that the 
Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), SECO, and the ESL report to the TCEQ all 

 
 
5-85
emission reductions resulting from EE/RE projects in Texas.  The ESL analyzed the following 
areas/programs: 
 
Renewable Energies 
The 79th Texas Legislature, 2005, amended SB 5 through SB 20, HB 2129, and HB 2481 to add, 
among other initiatives, the following renewable energy initiatives, which require:  5,880 
megawatts of generating capacity from renewable energy by 2015; the TCEQ to develop a 
methodology for calculating emission reductions from renewable energy initiatives and 
associated credits; the ESL to assist the TCEQ in quantifying emissions reductions from EE/RE 
programs; and  the PUCT to establish a target of 10,000 megawatts of installed renewable 
technologies by 2025. 
 
Residential Building Codes and Programs 
The THSC, Chapter 388, Texas Building Energy Performance Standards, as adopted by the 77th 
Texas Legislature, 2001, states in § 388.003(a) that single-family residential construction must 
meet the energy efficiency performance standards established in the energy efficiency chapter of 
the International Residential Code.  The Furnace Pilot Light Program includes energy savings 
accomplished by retrofitting existing furnaces.  Also included are Seasonal Energy Efficiency 
Ratio (SEER) 13 upgrades to single-family and multi-family buildings.  In January 2006, federal 
regulations mandated that the minimum efficiency for residential air conditioners be increased 
from SEER 10 to SEER 13. 
 
Commercial Building Codes 
The THSC, Chapter 388, Texas Building Energy Performance Standards, as adopted by the 77th 
Texas Legislature, 2001, states in § 388.003(b) that all other residential, commercial, and 
industrial construction must meet the energy efficiency performance standards established in the 
energy efficiency chapter of the International Energy Conservation Code. 
 
Federal Facilities EE/RE Projects 
Federal facilities are required to reduce energy use by Presidential Executive Order 13123 and the 
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58 EPACT20065).  The ESL compiled energy 
reductions data for the federal EE/RE projects in Texas. 
 
Political Subdivisions Projects 
SECO funds loans for energy-efficiency projects for state agencies, institutions of higher 
education, school districts, county hospitals, and local governments.  Political subdivisions in 
nonattainment and affected counties are required by SB 5 to report EE/RE projects to SECO.  
These projects are typically building systems retrofits, nonbuilding lighting projects, and other 
mechanical and electrical systems retrofits such as municipal water and waste water treatment 
systems.   
 
Electric Utility Sponsored Programs 
Utilities are required by SB 7, 76th Texas Legislature, 1999, and SB 5, 77th Texas Legislature, 
2001, to report these projects to the PUCT.  See THSC, § 386.205 and Texas Utilities Code,  
§ 39.905.  These projects are typically air conditioner replacements, ventilation duct tightening, 
and commercial and industrial equipment replacement. 
 
In addition to the programs discussed and analyzed in the ESL report, local governments may 
have enacted measures beyond what has been reported to SECO and the PUCT.  The TCEQ 
encourages local political subdivisions to promote EE/RE measures in their respective 
communities and to ensure these measures are fully reported to SECO and the PUCT. 
 
HB 3693, 80th Texas Legislature, 2007, amended the Texas Education Code, Texas Government 
Code, THSC, and Texas Utilities Code.  The bill: 

 
 
5-86
 
• 
requires state agencies, universities and local governments to adopt energy efficiency 
programs; 
• 
provides additional incentives for electric utilities to expand energy conservation and 
efficiency programs; 
• 
includes municipal-owned utilities and cooperatives in efficiency programs; 
• 
increases incentives and provides consumer education to improve efficiency programs; 
and 
• 
supports other programs such as revision of building codes and research into alternative 
technology and renewable energies. 
 
Emissions reductions as a result of the above programs were not explicitly included in the 
photochemical modeling because local efficiency efforts may not result in local emissions 
reductions or may be offset by increased demand in electricity.  The complex nature of the 
electrical grid also makes accurately quantifying emission reductions from EE/RE projects 
difficult.  At any given time, it is impossible to determine exactly where on the electrical grid 
electricity comes from for any certain electrical user.  The electricity for a user could be from a 
power plant in west Texas, a nearby attainment county or from within the nonattainment area.  If 
electrical demand is reduced in the HGB area due to these kinds of measures, then emission 
reductions from power generation facilities may occur in any number of locations around the 
state. 
 
5.4.3.5  Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) 
The EPA projects that CAIR regional controls will improve air quality in the HGB area, as well 
as most of Texas, according to EPA’s Texas CAIR Web page, http://www.epa.gov/cair/tx.html. 
 
Under CAIR, 28 eastern states (plus the District of Columbia) are required to comply with a cap 
on sulfur dioxide (SO2) and NOX for EGU emissions.  The definition of an EGU for the CAIR 
program is approximately the same definition as that for an FCAA Title IV Acid Rain unit (i.e., 
larger than 25 megawatt (MW) and more than one-third of its generation going to the public grid 
for sale).  CAIR is a cap and trade program, with each of the CAIR-applicable states given a 
calculated NOX budget and a calculated SO2 budget by the EPA.  The EPA modeled all of these 
states in order to test the effectiveness of controls.  A result of EPA’s CAIR modeling was that 
Texas “significantly contributed” to the nonattainment of the particulate matter of 2.5 microns 
and less (PM2.5) standard of two counties in Illinois, therefore, Texas was included in CAIR for 
the transport of PM2.5.  Texas is not covered under the CAIR program for 1997 eight-hour ozone 
standard contribution. 
 
CAIR is implemented in two phases:  for NOX, Phase I covers the years 2009 through 2014 and 
Phase II is for the years 2015 and later; for SO2, Phase I covers the years 2010 through 2014 and 
Phase II is for the years 2015 and later.  The Phase I NOX budget calculated and assigned to Texas 
was 181,014 tons per year, and the Phase II NOX budget was 150,845.  Because 2018 is the HGB 
ozone attainment year, this SIP revision incorporates CAIR Phase II (post 2014 step-down of 
CAIR) which provides for a Texas state-wide NOX budget of 150,845 tons per year, or 413.3 tons 
per day. 
 
See Appendix B:  Emissions Modeling for the HGB Attainment Demonstration SIP, Section 
2.3.1.2.1 for the procedural details that the TCEQ used to simulate CAIR Phase II in Texas and 
the regional states. 
 
On July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit (Court) (No. 
05-1244) vacated CAIR and the CAIR Federal Implementation Plan (FIP).  On December 23, 
2008, the Court issued a revised opinion to remand, without vacating, CAIR to the EPA.  
Therefore, CAIR will remain in effect while the EPA analyzes data and conducts rulemaking to 

 
 
5-87
modify the program to comply with the Court’s July 2008 opinion.  The Court declined to impose 
a schedule by which the EPA must complete the rulemaking, but reminded the EPA that the 
Court does “. . . not intend to grant an indefinite stay of the effectiveness of this Court’s 
decision.”  For more information on the ruling, see EPA’s CAIR Web page, 
http://www.epa.gov/cair/, or the TCEQ CAIR/CAMR Web page, 
 http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/sip/caircamr.html. 
 
Any future EPA revision to the CAIR program to comply with the court’s ruling may result in 
additional reductions. 
 
5.4.3.6  Texas Emission Reduction Plan (TERP) 
The TERP program was created in 2001 by the 77th Texas Legislature to provide grants to offset 
the incremental costs associated with reducing NOX emissions from high-emitting internal 
combustion engines.  To date the TERP program has funded over $700 million in grants for 
projects in Texas ozone nonattainment and near-nonattainment areas.  Over $300 million of that 
amount has been awarded to projects in the HGB area since 2001, which will help reduce more 
than 66,000 tons of NOX emissions.  Of that $300 million, $5 million was awarded to the H-GAC 
through a third-party grant to administer additional grants in the HGB area. 
 
Additional funds are expected to be awarded to the HGB area in subsequent grant application 
periods that will result in further NOX reductions.  HB 1796, 81st Texas Legislature, 2009, 
extended the TERP program beyond its current 2013 date to 2019, which will result in continued 
reductions in the significant emissions source categories of on-road and non-road engines. 
 
5.4.3.7  Low Income Vehicle Repair Assistance, Retrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle Retirement 
Program (LIRAP) 
SB 12, 80th Texas Legislature, 2007, enhanced LIRAP to expand participation by increasing the 
income eligibility to 300 percent of the federal poverty rate and increasing the amount of 
assistance toward the replacement of a retired vehicle.  The program, known as AirCheckTexas 
Drive a Clean Machine (DACM), provides $3,500 for hybrids of the current or previous model 
year; $3,000 for cars of the current or three model years; and, $3,000 for trucks of the current or 
previous two model years.  The retired vehicle must be 10 years or older or have failed an 
emissions test.  In the HGB area, DACM is available to vehicle owners in five counties:  
Brazoria, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, and Montgomery.  Between December 2007 and May 31, 
2009, LIRAP/DACM has retired and replaced 9,330 vehicles at a cost of $28,370,520.  An 
additional 3,949 vehicles have had emissions-related repairs at a cost of $2,136,602.  The total 
repair and retirement/replacement funding for the HGB area since December 2007 is 
$30,507,122. 
 
5.4.3.8  Clean School Bus Program 
HB 3469, 79th Texas Legislature, 2005, established the Clean School Bus Program.  The new 
program is codified in THSC, Chapter 390 and implemented through 30 TAC §§ 114.640 – 
114.648. 
 
The program is based on the EPA guidance documents, Improving Air Quality with Economic 
Incentive Programs (EPA-452/R-01-001) and Diesel Retrofits:  Quantifying and Using Their 
Benefits in SIPs and Conformity (EPA-420-B-06-005).  Under the economic incentive program 
guidance, the TCEQ is using the financial mechanism option, which is described as subsidies 
targeted at promoting pollution-reducing activities or products.   
 
The Clean School Bus Program was established to provide monetary incentives for school 
districts in the state for reducing emissions of diesel exhaust in school buses.  Eligible 
technologies include those approved by the EPA, certified by the California Air Resources Board, 
or those that the executive director finds will bring about significant emissions reductions.  Some 

 
 
5-88
of the technologies eligible for funding under the program reduce NOX emissions.  However, the 
technologies mainly reduce particulate matter and reduce only negligible amounts of NOX.  The 
80th Texas Legislature, 2007, provided funding for the Clean School Bus Program. 
 
As of May 2009, the TCEQ Clean School Bus grant program has allocated $13.8 million in grants 
for nearly 5,000 school buses in Texas.  In addition, through Supplemental Environmental 
Projects (SEPs), the TCEQ has also allocated over $3.5 million to third-party SEP receivers for 
the same kind of school bus retrofits. 
 
5.4.3.9  81st Texas Legislature, 2009 
HB 432 requires state agencies that purchase passenger vehicles or other ground transportation 
vehicles for general use to ensure that not less than 25 percent of new vehicles purchased during a 
biennium meet or exceed EPA’s Tier II, Bin 3 emission standards.  This bill also limits the 
purchase of state agency passenger vehicles or other ground transportation vehicles purchased for 
general use to only those vehicles that use compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied 
petroleum gas, methanol or methanol/gasoline blends of 85 percent or greater, ethanol or 
ethanol/gasoline blends of 85 percent or greater, biodiesel or biodiesel/diesel blends of 20 percent 
or greater, or electricity, including electricity to power a plug-in hybrid motor vehicle. 
 
HB 1796 establishes a New Technology Implementation Grants (NTIG) program for facilities 
and stationary sources under TERP, requires the current New Technology Research and 
Development under TERP to be administered by the TCEQ, and extends the TERP to August 31, 
2019.  See Section 5.4.3.6, Texas Emission Reduction Plan (TERP), for additional information. 
 
SB 1759 establishes a Texas Clean Fleet Program to be administered by the TCEQ, funding it 
with 5 percent of the 87.5 percent of the Emission Reduction Incentives Grant within TERP.  The 
Texas Clean Fleet Program will provide grants to encourage large fleets to replace diesel-
powered fleet vehicles with hybrid vehicles or alternative fuel-powered vehicles. 
 
5.4.3.10  American Waterways Operators Tank Barge Emissions Best Management Practices 
 
Using infrared gas imaging technology in field studies conducted in the summer of 2005, the 
TCEQ detected inadvertent VOC emissions from tank barges operating in the HGB area.  The 
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) also detected inadvertent emissions 
from tank barges in similar field studies conducted in the same time period.  In response to these 
field studies, the American Waterways Operators (AWO) voluntarily developed industry Best 
Management Practices (BMP) to reduce VOC emissions from tank barges.  The BMP includes 
procedures to reduce VOC emissions from equipment and operations on tank barges.  The 
recommendations are a combination of inspection, corrective action, preventative maintenance, 
operational, procedural, and training practices. 
 
The BMP was reviewed by the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC), United 
States Coast Guard, LDEQ, and TCEQ.  The BMP was distributed to AWO members in 2006 for 
implementation on a voluntary basis.  In 2009, AWO reconvened the Tank Barge Emissions 
Working Group to review the BMP and make further improvements to the document.  The 
improved BMP will be sent to CTAC, the Coast Guard, LDEQ, and TCEQ for review once it has 
been finalized by industry.  While the BMP is a voluntary measure and does not impose an 
enforceable commitment on AWO members, the implementation of the BMP, where applicable, 
may contribute to reducing inadvertent VOC emissions from barges during dock operations and 
during transit, which will help improve the air quality in the HGB area.  A copy of the 2006 BMP 
document is provided in Appendix J:  Recommendations for Best Management Practices to 
Control and Reduce Inadvertent Cargo Vapor Emissions in the Tank Barge Community.

5.4.3.11  Local Initiative Projects 
SB 12, 80th Texas Legislature, 2007, allowed the use of unexpended LIRAP funds to be used for 
Local Initiative Projects.  These projects provide funding to LIRAP-participating counties for 
implementation of air quality improvement strategies through local projects and initiatives.  Local 
Initiative Projects may include: 
 
• 
expand and enhance the repair and replacement program; 
• 
develop and implement programs to remotely determine vehicle emissions and notify the 
vehicle’s operator; 
• 
develop and implement projects for coordinating with local law enforcement officials to 
reduce the use of counterfeit state inspection stickers; 
• 
develop and implement programs to enhance transportation system improvements; or 
• 
develop and implement new air control strategies designed to assist local areas in complying 
with state and federal air quality rules and regulations. 
 
5.4.3.12  Other Local Programs 
The Houston-Galveston Area Council submitted the following programs, which were not 
committed to as Transportation Control Measures or Voluntary Mobile Emission Reduction 
Program measures, but may be implemented locally in the HGB area.  For a detailed analysis of 
these programs, see Appendix F:  Evaluation of Mobile Source Control Strategies for the 
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria State Implementation Plan (prepared by ENVIRON for the 
Houston-Galveston Area Council). 
 
Scrappage and Buy-Back Plan 
This measure would build on the existing LIRAP, implemented as part of the AirCheckTexas 
Vehicle Emissions Testing program, by increasing the number of on-road light-duty gasoline 
vehicles scrapped.  The plan would also make separate funds available to help with the purchase 
of new on-road heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDV) to replace old, highly polluting vehicles. 
 
Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance 
Pay-As-You-Drive Vehicle Insurance, also called Distance-Based Vehicle Insurance and 
Mileage-Based Insurance, is a program that allows a vehicle’s insurance premiums to be based 
directly on how many miles the vehicle is driven during the policy term.  Currently, vehicle 
insurance is structured where high-mileage drivers are, in essence, subsidized by low-mileage 
drivers since all drivers are charged the same premiums after accounting for driving history 
related to collisions and traffic violations. 
 
Limitations on Idling of Heavy-Duty Vehicles; Creation of Regional Government Idling 
Restrictions 
Idling of vehicles is inherently an inefficient operation that can produce unwanted air pollutants.  
Idling also occurs during normal driving and other operations such as when the engine powers 
necessary accessories, known as power take-off, including man-lifts or concrete tumblers.  It is 
not possible to eliminate all idling, but idle reduction programs are typically low in cost and may 
result in a net savings to the owner/operator of the vehicle while also reducing air emissions. 
 
Encourage/Mandate Livable Centers 
The EPA developed the Smart Growth Implementation Assistance (SGIA) program in response to 
communities' requests for help achieving their development goals.  Through this program, the 
EPA provides technical assistance from private-sector experts to help communities find the best 
tools and resources for planning growth in ways that sustain environmental and economic 
progress and create a high quality of life.  The Gulf Coast Institute, Main Street Coalition, and 
Texas A&M partnered to apply for and received an SGIA grant in 2006.  While the City of 
Houston is not participating in the SGIA program at this time, the area has expressed interest in 
evaluating the potential effects of these measures on travel activity and emissions. 

 
 
5-90
 
Enhanced Enforcement of Smoking Vehicles 
This measure would encourage local law enforcement officers to enforce existing smoking 
vehicle laws and enable the emissions inspection status of smoking vehicles to be checked.  
Owners of smoking vehicles displaying a valid inspection sticker would be fined.  Smoking 
vehicles not having a valid inspection sticker would be impounded if the sticker were found to be 
fraudulent. 
 
Limitation on Idling of Heavy-Duty Construction Equipment 
Idling is an inefficient use of equipment in general and generates unnecessary emissions.  Idling 
however cannot be avoided in all cases, such as during normal work, when work is performed 
intermittently, and when the time to restart the engine would be considered a significant delay.  
This measure would seek to limit excessive idling when equipment is not required immediately.  
Suggested periods for limiting idling could be as little as 15 minutes maximum.  Many on-road 
trucks have factory-installed engine shutdown systems that automatically shut down the engine 
after a set period, or devices could be added to existing equipment.  To implement this measure, 
engine shutdown systems could be employed with idle timers set to a period that would not cause 
typical operational problems. Operator training could provide significant idle reduction perhaps 
beyond engine shutdown systems. 
 
5.5  CONCLUSIONS 
The TCEQ has employed several sophisticated technical tools to evaluate the past and present 
causes and effects of high ozone in the HGB area in an effort to predict the area’s future air 
quality.  Photochemical grid modeling has been performed and its performance has been 
rigorously evaluated.  Historical trends in ozone and ozone precursor concentrations and their 
causes have been investigated exhaustively.  The following conclusions can be reached from 
these evaluations.   
 
First, the photochemical grid modeling performs relatively well.  Problems observed with the 
modeling are those that are known to exist in all photochemical modeling exercises.  In spite of 
the known shortcomings, the model can be used carefully to predict ozone concentrations. The 
photochemical grid modeling predicts that the control strategy package chosen by the TCEQ can 
lower the ozone design values in the HGB area down to a value very near the 0.08 ppm eight-
hour ozone standard.  The dynamic model evaluations show that the model response to emission 
decreases is less than the response observed in the atmosphere, suggesting that the proposed 
emission controls are more likely to yield attainment of the eight-hour 0.08 ppm ozone standard 
than the absolute modeled design values indicate.  
 
Second, the ozone trend analyses show that ozone has decreased significantly since the late 
1990s.  Meteorological variations alone cannot explain the significant downward trend.  
Decreases in background ozone cannot explain the downward trend either.  Significant decreases 
in ozone precursors, however, coincide with the decreases in ozone, indicating that the ozone 
decreases observed in the HGB area are due to local emission controls.   
 
Third, many additional air quality improvement measures are being adopted in the HGB area that 
cannot be included in the photochemical modeling analysis because they cannot be accurately 
quantified. These additional measures can provide additional assurance that the HGB area is on 
the path toward attainment. 
 
Based upon the photochemical grid modeling results and these corroborative analyses, the weight 
of evidence indicates that the HGB area will attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard by June 
15, 2019.

CHAPTER 6:  ONGOING AND FUTURE INITIATIVES 
 
6.1  INTRODUCTION 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is committed to improving the air 
quality in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area and continues to work toward identifying 
and reducing ozone precursors.  Texas is investing resources into technological research and 
development for advancing pollution control technology, improving the science for ozone 
modeling and analysis, and refining quantification of volatile organic compound (VOC) 
emissions.  Refining quantification of VOC emissions benefits SIP planning by improving 
understanding of ozone formation.  Additionally, the TCEQ is working with the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), local area leaders, and the scientific community to 
identify new measures for reducing ozone precursors.  This chapter describes ongoing technical 
work that will be beneficial to improving air quality in Texas and the HGB area. 
 
6.2  ONGOING WORK 
6.2.1  Flare Task Force 
In November 2008, the TCEQ formed an agency-wide task force to comprehensively evaluate all 
aspects of flares in Texas.  The Flare Task Force is evaluating how flares factor into air quality 
challenges with an emphasis on air toxics and ozone.  Some of the specific issues under 
evaluation include:  different factors affecting flare performance, such as waste gas flow rates, 
turndown ratio, and waste gas to steam assist ratios; the adequacy of existing monitoring 
requirements for flares; and alternatives to flaring routine emissions.  A stakeholder group 
associated with the Flare Task Force has been formed to solicit comment on these issues related 
to flares.  A report for executive management is planned that will include options, considerations, 
and recommendations for improving our understanding and regulation of flares with the goal of 
improving air quality.  Additional information about the Flare Task Force is available at the 
stakeholder Web site: 
http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/rules/flare_stakeholder.html. 
 
6.2.2  Technologies for Detecting VOC 
6.2.2.1  Optical Gas Imaging Technology 
Optical gas imaging technology offers a unique technological advancement in pollution detection 
capability and has proved to be highly effective in the detection of VOC emissions.  An optical 
gas imaging system is a useful tool that assists the agency in actions such as facility 
investigations, reconnaissance investigations, mobile monitoring, and special projects.   This 
technology is also useful in identifying sources of VOC emissions that are underestimated, 
underreported, unreported, or previously unregulated.  The system also has the potential to 
advance leak detection and repair (LDAR) work practices and enable monitoring of components 
that are difficult to monitor with traditional LDAR methods.  However, the commission has 
technical and enforcement concerns associated with the potential regulatory implementation of 
this technology.  A standardized method or performance specification is necessary to ensure 
consistent and reliable application of optical gas imaging instrumentation.  Methods and 
specifications are also necessary to set minimum standards of performance to evaluate different 
potential technologies. 
 
The TCEQ uses the optical gas imaging technology as a screening tool in the following areas:  
offsite surveillance to identify potential sources of contaminants in response to ambient or other 
monitoring results; identification of sites, or areas with a specific site, where a focused 
investigation may be conducted; identification of potential source control strategies or to assist in 
an assessment of existing strategies; and identification of sources for emissions inventory issues. 
 
6.2.2.2  Open Path Sensing Technology 
Open path sensing technology allows specific pollutants to be monitored over a given distance 
(10 meters up to several kilometers) and generally provides very rapid measurements.  Some of 
these techniques, such as solar occulation flux (SOF), differential absorption lidar (DIAL), and 

 
6-2 
imaging differential optical absorption spectroscopy (I-DOAS) provide specific capabilities that 
include the ability to monitor air pollutants not only at ground level but also along a given path 
length in the sky, which allows measurements of specific elevated sources such as flares, vents, 
and storage tanks.  This information coupled with meteorological measurements and modeling 
tools are capable, in some cases, of providing emission estimates not otherwise available.  These 
data can be helpful in evaluating actual emissions from specific sources.  These measurement 
techniques also have limitations or challenges that include the following. 
 
• 
They are non-separatory techniques, i.e., do not physically isolate the chemical or 
chemicals of interest from other constituents, and as such are more prone to interference. 
• 
They normally measure a path length average concentration or number of molecules and 
as such do not provide a specific concentration at any given point and can thus be 
difficult to compare with standards or guideline concentrations. 
• 
They are difficult to assess from a data quality standpoint because they are an open path 
technology and thus have limitations for enforcement or compliance-related purposes. 
• 
They are complex instrumentation with limited commercial availability that requires a 
highly experienced operator and data analyst to obtain quality data.  In some cases, such 
as SOF and DIAL, there may be only a few operational instruments and qualified 
personnel in the world, which limits the ability of Texas to either acquire and operate the 
instrumentation or contract operation on anything but a sporadic basis. 
 
6.2.2.3  DIAL Remote Sensing Technology 
The TCEQ continued to advance the science of determining emissions from industrial sources by 
performing a five-week emissions monitoring study in the Texas City area during the summer of 
2007.   For the first time, a regulatory agency in the United States used a mobile DIAL remote 
sensing technology to measure emissions from industrial sources.  The study, funded by the EPA 
and the TCEQ, focused on gathering data from industrial sources that are difficult to measure 
using conventional sampling techniques.  The resulting scientific data and future studies will help 
guide future research efforts and may result in additional control measures, refined emissions 
models for common sources, and improved emissions inventories. 
 
The TCEQ contracted with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), based in the United 
Kingdom, to perform DIAL measurements on industrial emissions sources located in a refinery 
and a storage terminal near Houston during 2007. 
 
Measurements focused on those industrial sources that are difficult to measure using conventional 
sampling techniques.  Specifically, the study involved: 
 
• 
identifying potentially under-reported industrial emissions sources; 
• 
conducting remote sensing measurements of these sources; 
• 
collecting process and operational data from these sources; and 
• 
comparing emissions determined using conventional EPA-approved determination methods 
to the remote sensing measurements. 
 
The NPL submitted a draft report in February 2008, which is expected to be finalized in fall 2009.  
An independent third party is currently comparing remote sensing measurements to 
conventionally determined emissions.  Although these results are still being analyzed, preliminary 
total VOC measurements indicate that flare emissions may be underreported when emissions are 
determined using conventional material balance calculation methods.  Additionally, preliminary 
results as well as other research indicate flare destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) may be 
reduced during certain operating conditions, such as combusting small volumes of waste gas and 
during flare air- or steam-assist operations. 
 
These preliminary results indicate the need to conduct a study that determines the relationship 
between flare design, operation, and DRE.

6.2.2.4  Helicopter-Mounted DIAL Imaging System 
The TCEQ completed field work in June 2009 to demonstrate the capabilities of a helicopter-
mounted DIAL.  The study’s major focus will be using the DIAL to locate sources of benzene 
emissions from industrial facilities in the Houston Ship Channel area.  The DIAL system used 
was developed to detect methane leaks during flyovers of gas pipelines.  The system uses the 
infrared absorption of methane to detect leaks.  The system has been used extensively and 
successfully to find pipeline leaks in concentrations as low as 1.7 parts per million (ppm) of 
methane.  Instrument sensitivity has been shown in the laboratory to be approximately 100 ppm 
for benzene.  However, with tuning and adjustments during flight measurements, the benzene 
sensitivity could be as low as 10 ppm.  While the primary purpose of this project will be to 
determine the capabilities of a helicopter-mounted DIAL, results from this project could also be 
used to determine potentially unreported or underreported sources of benzene.  Successful 
location of benzene sources in the surveyed areas may show the potential benefit of a full-scale 
survey of the entire Houston Ship Channel as well as other industrial areas.  A final report is due 
to the agency by August 2009 and the agency final evaluation of the technology should be 
completed by the fall of 2009. 
 
6.2.2.5  Flare Study 
The purpose of the flare study is to measure flare emissions and collect required process and 
operational data in a controlled laboratory environment to determine the relationship between 
flare design, operation, and DRE.  Direct measurement techniques of flare emissions, 
conceptually similar to those employed by the EPA flare studies in the 1980s, as well as remote 
sensing measurement techniques will be employed in the laboratory environment.  Analysis of 
collected process and operational data will allow comparisons between traditional flare material 
balance emissions determinations, process stream measurements, and the emissions rates and 
concentrations measured by the direct and remote sensing technologies. 
 
The TCEQ anticipates that the results of the laboratory tests will be broadly applicable, since 
these measurements will be conducted under controlled conditions.  The TCEQ also anticipates 
that the tests will provide insight to operational conditions that may impact flare VOC DRE and 
flare combustion efficiency, such as assist rates or waste gas volumetric flow rates. 
 
The primary study objectives include: 
 
• assessing the potential impact of waste stream flow rate turndown on flare DRE and 
combustion efficiency; 
• assessing the potential impact of steam/air assist on flare DRE and combustion efficiency 
at various operating conditions, including low flow rate conditions; 
• assessing whether flares operating over the range of requirements stated in 40 Code of 
Federal Regulations § 60.18 achieve the assumed hydrocarbon DRE of 98 percent at 
varying flow-rate turndown and assist ratios as well as variable waste stream heat 
content; and 
• identifying and quantifying the hydrocarbon species in flare plumes currently visualized 
with passive infrared cameras. 
 
Field tests should be conducted during the November 2009 to March 2010 time frame, depending 
on approval of the final test plan and the availability of a test facility.  A final report is expected 
during the summer of 2010. 
 
6.2.2.6  Study of Houston Atmospheric Radical Precursors (SHARP)  
An extensive field study of ozone precursors and formation was conducted in the HGB area in 
April, May, and June 2009 using cutting-edge measurement technology.  Approximately $2 
million of air quality research funds for this project were provided by the state legislature.  The 
goal of the SHARP study is to investigate the: 

 
6-4 
 
• 
contribution of direct emissions of formaldehyde and nitrous acid from flares, stacks, and 
other point and mobile sources; 
• 
importance of secondary formation of formaldehyde from the ozonolysis of olefins; 
• 
identification of formation pathways of nitrous acid; 
• 
ambient levels of nitryl chloride and potential impact as a ozone precursor; and 
• 
spring and early summer ozone formation mechanisms in the HGB area. 
 
The data from this study will be analyzed in 2009 and 2010 and used to better understand HGB 
area emissions and chemistry, enhance model inputs and mechanisms, and aid in the evaluation of 
control strategy development. 
 
6.3  FUTURE INITIATIVES 
6.3.1  Mid-Course Review (MCR) 
The commission is soliciting comments on whether it is appropriate to perform a 1997 eight-hour 
ozone standard MCR analysis for the HGB area, and, if so, what elements should be contained in 
the analysis.  The commission is also seeking input on the appropriate date to submit the MCR. 
 
6.3.2  2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) 
On March 12, 2008, the EPA strengthened its NAAQS for ground-level ozone from 0.08 parts per 
million 
(ppm) 
to 
0.075 
ppm. 
 
Governor 
Rick 
Perry 
submitted the state's 
recommendation regarding boundaries and designations under the federal 2008 eight-hour ozone 
standard to the EPA on March 10, 2009.  The HGB area (Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, 
Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties) was included in the governor’s 
recommended nonattainment areas.  Continued efforts to reduce ozone precursors will be 
necessary to address this new ozone standard.

Executive Summary
Background
In recent years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and some State and local permitting
authorities recognized a change in the manufacturing landscape.  This change arose in today’s increasingly
competitive global markets, requiring companies to respond rapidly to market signals and demand, while
delivering products faster, at lower cost, and of equal or better quality than their competitors.  As their market
response and product development time frames shrank, companies in several industries perceived the potential
administrative “friction” – costs, time, delay, uncertainty, and risk – resulting from operating under
conventional air permitting approaches to increase.  This raised an important question:  how to provide these
U.S. companies with the “flexibility” to compete effectively in global markets without decreasing
environmental protection?  At the same time, the EPA and others sought ways to align the regulatory
framework to encourage emissions reduction and pollution prevention.
To address these challenges, the EPA and several State and local permitting authorities worked with selected
companies over the past few years in the context of individual permit pilots to develop innovative approaches
to air permitting.  The EPA and the States launched these efforts to increase sources’ operational flexibility
while ensuring environmental protection and facilitating pollution prevention.  Permitting authorities involved
in these pilot initiatives designed permits within the existing regulatory framework to address all applicable
air requirements.  As interest in innovative approaches to air permitting increased, the EPA evaluated the
implementation experience with “flexible” permitting techniques developed under pilot permitting efforts, such
as the EPA’s Pollution Prevention in Permitting Program (P4) and various State innovation initiatives.  The
EPA believes that careful evaluation of the implementation experience with such flexible permits can improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of future efforts and help to inform evolving air policymaking activities in
these areas.  The EPA launched the Flexible Permit Implementation Review to meet these objectives.
What Is Flexible Air Permitting?
The term “flexible permit” is used in this report to describe air permits with conditions designed to reduce the
administrative “friction” – costs, time, delay, uncertainty, and risk – experienced by sources and permitting
authorities when implementing a permit or making certain changes under the permit.  This is typically
accomplished by allowing a source to make certain types of changes (e.g., modifications to a source’s method
of operation, equipment, raw materials, emission factors, or monitoring parameters) without requiring
additional case-by-case permitting, provided the source meets certain criteria outlined in its operating or
construction permit.  Such criteria might include the maintenance of plant-wide emissions levels below
enforceable caps.  Over the past decade, the EPA and State and local permitting authorities have also piloted
specific permitting techniques and tools to accomplish advance-approval for certain types of changes that
might take place over the course of a permit term.  While chosen solutions will depend on individual state
permitting rules and requirements, such techniques typically include descriptions of advance-approved
changes or categories of changes in the permit, procedures for testing pollution control device performance
and updating emission factors or parameter values without requiring the permit to be amended or re-opened,
elimination of redundant requirements by applying the most stringent applicable requirement, and provisions
to explicitly encourage pollution prevention.

Flexible Permit Implementation Review Findings
The EPA launched the Flexible Permit Implementation Reviews to examine the implementation experience
with innovative air permitting techniques.  Under this initiative, the EPA assembled a Review Team,
representing multiple EPA offices supplemented by contractor support, to conduct in-depth reviews of six pilot
permits with innovative flexibility provisions and sufficient operating history.  These pilot permits were
developed for the following companies: 3M, DaimlerChrysler, Imation, Intel, Lasco Bathware, and Saturn.
The reviews included detailed analyses of source and permitting authority experiences developing and
implementing flexible air permits, based on review of information in the public record, discussions with source
and permitting authority personnel, site visits to the source and permitting authorities, and verification of
recordkeeping and emissions calculation requirements.
The EPA’s review and analyses support the following findings for the six flexible permits covered in this
review.
Finding 1: The flexible permits contain adequate measures to assure compliance with all applicable
requirements.
Permitting authorities and the EPA found that the flexible permits contained monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting mechanisms sufficient to assure that identified regulatory requirements are met and that appropriate
measures are in place.  The EPA Review Team did find, however, that certain topics related to renewal of
flexible permits warrant further discussion and clarification.  These topics include determining acceptable
approaches for adjusting plant-wide emissions caps at permit renewal, and determining acceptable approaches
to transition back to conventional permitting approaches if flexible permits are allowed to expire.
Finding 2: The flexible permits were considered to be enforceable by permitting authorities and
EPA.
A key objective was to verify that the flexible permit provisions are enforceable by permitting authorities and
the EPA.  The six permitting authorities involved in the pilots all reported the ability to detect non-compliance
with flexible permit conditions and to enforce the permit requirements, and expressed certainty that permit
requirements could be enforced, had the need arisen.  For all permits, the EPA was able to replicate the
emissions calculations for selected time periods to demonstrate compliance.  Permitting authorities reported
that conducting inspections of sources with flexible permits is comparable to conducting inspections of sources
with conventional permits.
Finding 3: The flexible permits facilitated and encouraged emissions reductions and pollution
prevention.
The flexible permits contain mechanisms designed to facilitate and encourage emissions reductions and
pollution prevention (P2).  Five of the sources with flexible permits lowered actual plant-wide emissions during
their permit terms, and the sixth source lowered its emissions per unit of production during the permit term.
For example, using pollution prevention (P2), Intel lowered actual emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) from 190 tons/year to 56 tons/year while increasing production.  After a substantial voluntary
reduction of VOC emissions from 10,000 tons/year, 3M further lowered its actual VOC emissions from 4,300
tons/year to below 1,000 tons/year.  This reduction resulted primarily from increased pollution control device
performance, greater use of voluntary controls, P2, and reduced production.  DaimlerChrysler lowered its

6
actual VOC emissions from 1,400 tons/year to less than 800 tons/year, primarily through P2 associated with
vehicle coatings and plant solvent usage.
The plant-wide emissions caps focused organizational attention on reducing plant-wide emissions.  In many
cases, the advance approved change provisions reduced the administrative “friction” associated with P2
changes, making such changes more attractive for sources to undertake.  The flexible permits increased
internal awareness and focus on pollution prevention at the sources through explicit P2 program, reporting,
and/or performance requirements.
Finding 4: Companies with the flexible permits believe that air permitting is on their critical
response path.
Each of the sources with flexible permits reported that conventional permitting approaches can constrain their
ability to compete effectively.  The combination of increasingly globalized competition and a shift to new
modes of production substantially increased the pressure to operate highly flexible, nimble, and responsive
research, development, and production operations.  For example, competitive pressures and computer design
advances in the automotive sector have compressed the new vehicle development process from five years
to less than 18 months, requiring increasingly flexible production systems and time sensitive equipment
changes.  For products in the semiconductor and specialty tape industries, competitive pressures frequently
cause certain products to become obsolete within six to nine months, as customers’ specifications change and
technology evolves.  Advance production concepts, such as lean manufacturing, designed to help firms
compete effectively, require rapid, and often iterative, operational and equipment changes for continuous
improvement of resource productivity, operational efficiency, and product quality.  For these reasons,
companies report that conventional case-by-case permitting actions can be problematic due to the potential
delay and uncertainty of final permit actions.  Companies with flexible permits identified similar needs at other
facilities and are interested in pursuing flexible permits for those facilities.
Finding 5: Companies with the flexible permits utilized their flexibility provisions.
Flexibility provision utilization during the permit terms exhibited rates and types of changes consistent with the
needs expressed by the companies during permit development.  The actual number of changes made using
advance approval and other flexibility provisions varied by source, with Intel implementing the most changes
(e.g., approximately 150 to 200 equipment and operational changes per year).  Other companies implemented
fewer changes (e.g., more in the range of 20 or fewer changes per year), but emphasized that the relative
value of making certain critical changes can be more important than the number of changes made.  Some
companies did not utilize all of the flexible permit provisions, but generally anticipated using the flexibility
provisions in the future.  The flexible permits accommodated a substantial number of advance approved
changes while providing sufficient clarity in describing the advance approved changes to ensure
enforceability.  Additionally, flexible permits facilitated an increase in the rate and a shift in the type of
changes made, when compared to what might have occurred under a conventional permit.
Finding 6: The flexible permits enhanced information sharing between the companies and
permitting authorities.
The flexible permits enhanced the permitting authorities’ overall understanding of company activities and
emissions as compared to conventional permitting approaches.  The flexible permit development process
provided the permitting authorities with a clearer understanding of the maximum emissions levels anticipated
during the permit terms.  During permit development, companies provided more information regarding the type
of changes anticipated during the permit term.  This provided a more comprehensive, up-front picture of

7
anticipated operational activities and associated environmental performance than a conventional permitting
process.
During permit implementation, information about a company’s specific changes under the advance approval
provisions was generally comparable to information provided under a conventional permitting process.  The
flexible permits also required information about total source emissions and pollution prevention that is not
typically required under conventional permitting.
Finding 7: The flexible permits generally provided to the public equivalent or greater information
than conventional permits.
The flexible permits shifted the timing, type, and format of information made available to the public about
emissions performance, operational and equipment changes, and P2 activities.  The specific format, timing,
and availability of certain types of information required by the flexible permits varied, particularly for advance
approved changes.  In all cases, the flexible permits provided more information up-front about operational
changes (or categories of changes) that the sources anticipated making during the permit terms.  This
provided the public with an opportunity to understand and comment on the companies’ anticipated changes.
During permit implementation, four of the flexible permits provided equivalent or greater information for
specific changes made under the advance approval provisions, although in a different format and timing than
typically available under conventional permitting.  In two cases, the pilot permits resulted in less information
about certain changes implemented under the advance approval provisions.  In the areas of total plant-wide
emissions information and/or P2 information, all of the pilot permits increased the availability of information
to the public for the companies’ emissions and activities.  For all six permits, the permitting authorities
indicated that, on balance, the flexible permits improved the availability of information to the public, ensuring
the flow of significant and meaningful information regarding the current status and future direction of
operations and emissions.
Finding 8: The flexible permits produced or are anticipated to produce net financial benefits to
companies and permitting authorities.
Companies and permitting authorities reported that the flexible permits resulted in net financial benefits or are
anticipated to do so in the future.  Companies and permitting authorities indicated that initial permit
development costs exceeded those required to develop conventional permits because of the innovative nature
of the permits and additional resources associated with developing site-specific flexible permit provisions.
In each case, however, companies and permitting authorities reported that the flexibility provisions decreased,
or are expected to decrease, the administrative costs of operating under the permit to more than offset the
initially higher permit development costs.  Companies reported that the potential opportunity costs of project
delays from air permitting can be high, ranging as high as several million dollars in just a few days.  In so far
as flexible permits can minimize project delays, the economic benefits to companies can be correspondingly
large.  Permitting authorities typically reported that the additional permit development costs for flexible permits
were offset by resource savings within the first three years of permit implementation.
Finding 9:  Permitting authorities are generally supportive of flexible permits as an option.
The six permitting authorities involved in the flexible permits indicated that they are pleased with the
environmental and administrative benefits of the permits.  They believe flexible permitting techniques are
useful tools to address some sources’ operational flexibility needs, to foster environmental improvements
through emissions reductions, and to reduce required permitting resources and backlogs for permitting.  This
increased permit efficiency allows the public agencies to focus resources on higher environmental

8
management priorities.  Permitting authorities expressed interest in renewing the flexible permits and
expanding the use of flexible permits within their jurisdictions and believed that finalization of EPA policy
and/or guidance for flexible permits should increase national interest and efficiency in expanding their use.
Additionally, permitting authorities stated that various forms of EPA outreach, training, and assistance would
be useful to assist permitting authorities to develop effective flexible permits.
Finding 10:  Permitting authorities indicated that flexible permit provisions should be matched with
a company’s need for flexibility and technical capacity to implement effectively its flexible permit
requirements.
Permitting authorities believe that flexible permits meet applicable requirements and are fully enforceable.
However, such permits may not be appropriate for all sources.  Permitting authorities believe that two critical
factors should be considered when determining the appropriateness of flexible permitting for a particular
company.  First, the company should be able to demonstrate that it has a sufficient need for the flexibility to
justify the additional up-front permitting authority time and resources required to develop flexible permit
provisions for the company.  Second, the company should exhibit the technical capacity to operate effectively
under a flexible permit.  Factors such as a source’s compliance history, commitment to pollution prevention,
and ability to track and manage operational changes and emissions should be considered by permitting
authorities when determining the appropriateness of a flexible permit for a company.

1The term “flexible permits” has been primarily used to describe permits with conditions that enable
permitted sources to make certain changes (e.g., modifications to operations, equipment, raw material, emission
factors, monitoring parameters) without requiring further case-by-case review and approval or permit modifications
from the permitting authority.  The term also encompasses those approved permit conditions which are sufficient to
enable a more expedited permit revision process, but not to accomplish a full advance-approval.  This report and its
appendices use the terms “flexible permits,” “flexible permit conditions,” and “flexibility provisions” to denote
permits and permit conditions that include such provisions related to advance approval.  See Section D for a
discussion of flexibility provisions examined by the EPA’s Flexible Permit Implementation Review.

I.  Introduction
A.  Project Scope and Purpose
Over the last several years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and several State and local
permitting authorities worked with several companies to develop innovative approaches to air permitting.  The
EPA and States launched these pilots to increase operational flexibility while ensuring environmental
protection.  Permit developers sought to encourage and facilitate emissions reductions and pollution prevention
with the flexible permits.  The permits were also designed to reduce the administrative “friction” – costs, time,
delay, uncertainty and risk – associated with making certain types of operational and equipment changes.
Additionally, permitting authorities desired to reduce the resources needed for case-by-case applicability
determinations and for the approval process of subject minor and major New Source Review (NSR) permit
applications and other permitting amendments.  Permitting authorities designed these “flexible permits” within
the existing regulatory framework (i.e., approaches were not precluded under any relevant Federal or State
regulation) to address all applicable air requirements.1
As interest in flexible air permitting increased, the EPA saw the need to evaluate the implementation
experience with flexible permits developed under pilot efforts such as EPA’s Pollution Prevention in
Permitting Program (P4) and State innovation activities.  Particular interest has focused on flexible permitting
techniques such as plant-wide emissions limits (e.g., plant-wide applicability limits, or PALs; potential-to-emit
caps).
In response to this need, the EPA launched the Flexible Permit Implementation Review to conduct in-depth
reviews of six flexible permits developed since 1993.  The EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards (OAQPS) initiated this effort, in partnership with EPA’s Office of Policy, Economics, and
Innovation (OPEI).  The EPA Office of Policy Analysis and Review (OPAR), the Office of General Counsel
(OGC), and the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) provided support for this effort.
The purpose of the Flexible Permit Implementation Review is to help the EPA:
•
Determine whether the flexible permits work as envisioned, providing the desired operational
performance improvements and environmental protection.
•
Obtain more detailed and better organized information regarding these efforts.
•
Improve communication of the details and results of these efforts.
•
Understand how such flexible permitting approaches might be improved.
•
Assess the level of environmental benefit achieved under flexible permits.
•
Learn how similar flexible permit development processes can be streamlined in the future.
•
Provide input, as appropriate, into the final development of corresponding EPA policy.

emissions, emissions sources, and emissions control equipment.  The Findings Section presents the EPA’s ten
major findings from this flexible permit evaluation.  Each finding is explored in detail, drawing on examples
from the six Permit Review Reports.
C.  Review Approach and Process
The EPA’s Flexible Permit Implementation Review involved detailed analysis of company and permitting
authority experiences implementing six flexible air permits.  To structure the six permit reviews, OAQPS
developed a “Flexible Permit Review Framework” that includes specific evaluation questions grouped into
eight areas of inquiry.  The Flexible Permit Review Framework was developed by OAQPS in consultation
with other EPA offices, including OPAR, OECA, OGC, and OPEI.
C.1  Flexible Permit Review Framework
The areas of inquiry in the Flexible Permit Review Framework are listed below.  Each of the six Permit
Review Reports accompanying this report are structured based on this review framework, and they include
the specific questions and areas of inquiry that were addressed by the reviews.
•
Background: This section examines background information on the permitting authority’s structure,
capacities, and processes; the pilot source’s operations and characteristics; and the company’s need
for flexibility.
•
Flexible Permit Design Features: This section examines the specific flexibility provisions
contained in the permit and the terms which assure compliance with them, including monitoring,
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
•
Public Participation and Public Perception: This section assesses the public’s participation in the
development of the flexible permit through examination of the public involvement process and the
record of public comments.  It examines the flows of information during development and
implementation of the pilot permit, and compares these to what might have been experienced under
conventional permitting.
•
Implementation of Flexible Permit Provisions: This section examines when and how flexible
permit provisions were actually utilized by the source during permit implementation.  It explores how
the flexible permit implementation might compare to the experience under a conventional permit.

design features, such as advance-approved change provisions, were adequate to assure compliance
with all applicable requirements.
•
Practical Enforceability of the Flexibility Provisions: This section assesses the ability of the
source and permitting authority to determine compliance with the permit conditions and applicable
requirements.  It also examines the ease of inspection associated with the flexible permit.
•
Permit Costs, Environmental Benefits, and Value Added: This section assesses the relative
costs and benefits of the flexible permit to the source and permitting authority, as compared to a
conventional permit.  In particular, this section examines whether the permit actually provided desired
flexibility to the source as well as equivalent or better environmental protection.
•
Other Issues:  This section addresses ways in which flexible permits can be improved and how the
EPA can support such improvements in the future.
C.2  EPA Review Team
The EPA assembled a core Permit Review Team consisting of representatives from various EPA offices,
including OAQPS, OPEI, and OECA.  Ross & Associates Environmental Consulting, Ltd., under subcontract
to the EPA through Industrial Economics, Inc., provided overall team coordination services and compiled
review results.  In addition, representatives from Midwest Research Institute, under contract to the EPA,
participated in the reviews to support the EPA’s evaluation of the emissions monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting requirements and practices.  At least six representatives from this group participated in each of the
six individual permit reviews and associated site visits.  In some cases, the EPA Review Team was
supplemented by representatives from the EPA Regional Office in which the pilot permit was developed.
C.3  Permit Review Process
The Flexible Permit Review Framework was completed for each of the six flexible permits.  This was
accomplished through extensive off-site research, on-site visits to the source and the permitting authority, and
a review process for finalizing responses to the Flexible Permit Review Framework.  Prior to each site visit,
preliminary responses to many of the review questions were drafted by the EPA and its contractors based
on information collected through pre-site visit conference calls with each company and permitting authority.
Background research also included review of the flexible permits and other publicly available records,
including permit applications, public comments received during permit review or implementation, inspection
reports, monitoring data summaries, compliance certifications, notices, and other records.
The on-site reviews consisted of visits to the source and the permitting authority.  The EPA Review Team’s
one to one-and-a-half day visits were designed to collect and verify evidence and data to complete the
Flexible Permit Implementation Review Reports.  The EPA on-site reviews were not conducted as
compliance audits of the sources.  Rather, they assessed the company and permitting authority’s experience
with developing and implementing the flexible permits, so as to help improve similar permits in the future.  The
site visits included discussions with company and permitting authority personnel and a walk-through of the
plant, as well as a detailed examination of on-site records, including monitoring data.  Representatives from
the permitting authority participated in the source site visits and discussions.  The plant site visits were
typically followed by a half-day visit of the EPA Review Team to the permitting authority offices to discuss
specific aspects of the review framework relevant to the permitting authority.  Company personnel did not
participate in meetings and discussions at the permitting authorities.

12
12
Following each site visit, extensive steps were taken to ensure the accuracy of information catalogued in the
Flexible Permit Review Frameworks.  EPA contractors prepared initial drafts of the Permit Review Reports.
EPA contractors conducted follow-up discussions, as necessary, with the sources and the permitting
authorities to complete these draft Permit Review Reports.  The EPA Review Team provided preliminary
review and comment on the draft Permit Review Reports.  The revised Permit Review Reports were then
forwarded to the relevant company and permitting authority contacts for review and comment.  Companies
and permitting authorities were asked to verify the accuracy and completeness of the responses contained
in the Permit Review Reports.  Based on these comments, the EPA contractors worked with OAQPS and
OPEI staff to finalize the six Permit Review Reports.  This Summary Report was prepared by OAQPS and
OPEI, with support from contractors, and was reviewed and commented on by other members of the EPA
Review Team.
C.4 Flexible Permit Selection
EPA selected six pilot permits for review based on the following criteria.
•
Extent of permit implementation and/or duration since permit issuance.
•
Likelihood of source and permitting authority voluntary participation in the review.
•
Number and type of flexibility provisions in permit.

Table 1.1 lists the six flexible permits selected for inclusion in the Flexible Permit Implementation Review (see
end of report).
D.  What Are Flexible Permit Provisions?
The term “flexible permit” is frequently used to describe pilot permits with conditions that reduce the
administrative “friction” – costs, time, delay, uncertainty, and risk – experienced by companies and permitting
authorities when making certain changes under the permit.  Such changes could include modifications to a
source’s method of operation, equipment, raw materials, emission factors, or monitoring parameters.  The six
flexible permits examined in this review contain flexibility provisions which advance approve such changes
or categories of changes.  While flexible permit solutions will depend on individual state permitting rules and
requirements, a variety of flexible permit provisions have been developed by the EPA and State and local
permitting authorities to accomplish advance approval for a category of changes.  Several types of flexible
permit provisions utilized in permits reviewed in this report are summarized below.
D.1  Description of Advance-Approved Changes
The six flexible permits include descriptions that enable the advance-approval of specific changes and/or
categories of changes.  Advance approved change descriptions typically allow companies to make a fairly
broad spectrum of modifications, eliminating the need for additional case-by-case review and approval by the
permitting authority at the time the plant makes the change.  Changes that trigger new applicable requirements
(i.e., requirements unaddressed by the advance approval provisions) or require modifications to monitoring,
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements are not advance approved.  To implement advance approved
changes, sources must maintain plant-wide emissions below applicable limits.  In addition, they typically must
submit notice to the permitting authority and maintain on-site logs providing documentation of the changes

2This assumes the sources is in an attainment area.  SERs also differ depending on the pollutant in
question.
13
13
implemented under the advance approval provisions (e.g., the addition of a new emissions unit).
Some of the flexible permits contain provisions that only partially advance approve particular types of changes,
providing a streamlined review and approval process.  Permitting authorities believe this to be useful as an
interim approach for certain types of changes and review requirements.  For example, a flexible permit might
advance approve a set of changes to which a source must apply best available control technology (BACT).
The permit, however, could preserve the conventional process for public comment on the company’s proposed
BACT approach, as well as the permitting authority’s opportunity to reject or comment on the proposed
BACT approach at the time of the change.
D.2  Plant-wide Emissions Limits
All six flexible permits contain one or more plant-wide caps on emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOC) and/or criteria air pollutants.  These emissions caps typically included annual/12-month rolling limits
(e.g., tons/year) and short-term limits (e.g., pounds/hour) that cover emissions from all emissions sources at
a plant, including any that may be “grandfathered” under the Clean Air Act.
Emissions caps can function in different ways.  First, caps can serve as a basis for ensuring new applicable
requirements are not triggered.  In other words, caps can be set in such a way that (as long as there is no
violation of the limit) new applicable requirements will not be triggered.  Potential-to-emit (PTE) caps typically
establish “synthetic” minor source status for applicability purposes under one or more regulations by setting
a limit on plant-wide emissions below the emissions threshold that would trigger major source status.  In
addition, for major sources, Plant-wide Applicability Limit (PAL) baselines are typically set at an average of
the actual plant emissions for the previous two years (or another more representative period) plus 39
tons/year, an increment just under the Significant Emissions Rate (SER) for VOC emissions of 40 tons/year
that would trigger major New Source Review.2  In another variation, Oregon rules establish an annual and
short-term Plant-Site Emissions Limit (PSEL) for sources in the State, based on each source’s actual
emissions in 1978, that is contained in the State Implementation Plan (SIP).  The PSEL also functions to
define the aggregate emissions level below which major NSR would not apply to changes made at the site.
Short-term emissions caps, where required, also act to assure that the advance approved changes in
combination with existing emissions do not adversely impact the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) (in attainment areas).  Finally, emissions caps serve to bound the magnitude of advance approved
changes so as to define them in a reasonably anticipated alternative operating scenario for title V permitting
purposes.  Often, when more than one cap was involved, these caps can be streamlined into one plant-wide
emissions limit (i.e., combined into the most stringent form) so as to serve multiple functions at the same time.
D.3  Replicable Testing Procedures
Several of the flexible permits contain replicable testing procedures that enable sources to update the
monitored parameter levels of concern (e.g., pollution control device efficiencies, emission factors), based
on approved testing results, without requiring a permit modification.  Permit provisions describe the replicable
procedure to be used when testing and updating parameters, and the actual parameter values are documented
in required correspondence between the permitting authority and company, which are maintained at the
source and in the permitting authority’s files along with the permit.
D.4  Applicable Requirement Streamlining
Pursuant to EPA guidance presented in White Paper Number Two, several of the flexible permits streamlined

14
14
applicable requirements to reduce permit complexity.  In these instances, overlapping and redundant
requirements were subsumed under the most stringent requirement(s).  This technique was particularly
effective when it was used as part of a “clean building” approach.  A “clean building” is a separate structure
or collection point within a plant site containing emissions units that are (or will be in the case of new units)
routed to one or more dedicated, state-of-the-art air pollution control devices.  To advance approve
modifications or new unit additions in a “clean building” with respect to all technology-based requirements,
the control device must assure compliance for all the advance approved changes (as well as for all unchanged
existing operations in the same building) with the most stringent requirement that could apply to any of the
activities being advance approved to occur within the “clean building.”
D.5  Pollution Prevention Provisions
Several of the flexible permits contained explicit pollution prevention (P2) conditions designed to focus greater
plant attention on P2 and to take full advantage of the P2 that often takes place when flexible permit
provisions are established.  These conditions ranged from P2 program development and reporting
requirements to enforceable P2 performance targets.
E.  Pilot Permit and Source Characteristics
While the flexible permits contain provisions to accomplish advance approval that are generally similar, each
permit has a unique combination of conditions that are tailored to the company’s flexibility needs,  operations,
and State-specific requirements.  This section introduces the six flexible permits evaluated by the EPA’s
Flexible Permit Implementation Review.  Table 1.2 highlights the key flexibility provisions in each permit (see
end of report).  The company operations, emissions sources, and emissions control equipment are summarized
below.  Detailed descriptions of source characteristics, flexible permit provisions, monitoring requirements,
and other background information are available in the six Permit Review Reports.
3M Company - St. Paul, Minnesota
3M’s St. Paul tape plant manufactures more than 550 specialty tape products, including automotive and
medical tapes, graphics tape, offset printing tape, and foam and double-sided tapes.  To produce tape
products, adhesives are mixed at the plant and then applied to a tape backing, or “web”, on one of 18 coaters.
The coated web is fed through ovens to volatilize excess solvent from the adhesives, and is then wound into
rolls and cut for packaging and shipment.  VOC emissions result from volatilized solvents coming off the
adhesive mixing areas and evaporation ovens and are controlled through a highly efficient regenerative
thermal oxidizer (RTO).  The flexible permit, issued in 1993, was needed to provide for an extensive program
of renovations to maintain the long-term viability of this plant in 3M’s network of plants.
DaimlerChrysler Corporation - Newark, Delaware
DaimlerChrysler’s Newark Assembly Plant (NAP) began producing the Dodge Durango, a sports utility
vehicle, in 1997.  While vehicle production levels tend to be cyclical due to model changeovers and economic
demand cycles, vehicle production in July 2001 was about 600 vehicles per day (200,000 vehicles/year).  The
NAP’s initial flexible permit, issued in 1995, enabled the source to retool for Durango production and to
construct a new vehicle coatings building adjacent to the assembly buildings.  Most VOC emissions result
from the various steps in the vehicle coating process (e.g., electro-coat dip tanks, paint booths, curing ovens),
and are controlled through pollution prevention (P2) efforts and, to a lesser extent, by a regenerative thermal
oxidizer.  The NAP emits criteria pollutants (PM10, SO2, NOx, and CO) from operation of the thermal

15
15
oxidizer, five boilers, paint curing ovens, and other combustion sources.
Imation Corporation - Weatherford, Oklahoma
Imation’s Weatherford plant consists of two separate buildings.  The North Building houses Printing and
Publishing Division operations and manufactures products for the graphics arts and printing industries.  Digital
and conventional proofing systems are produced by coating thin films with colored, solvent-borne solids.  The
South Building contains Data Storage Division operations and produces data storage products such as
computer diskettes.  VOC emissions result from the solvent-borne coatings as they are mixed, applied to the
film, and heated in curing ovens.  Production areas are maintained with negative pressure and VOC emissions
from the coaters and ovens are routed to voluntarily installed pollution control devices, including a regenerative
thermal oxidizer, a catalytic oxidizer, and a carbon absorber.  The pollution control equipment, two on-site
boilers, and other miscellaneous combustion sources emit criteria pollutants.  The design of the permit was
critically needed for Imation to test new raw materials and processes in a timely manner.
Intel Corporation - Aloha, Oregon
Intel’s Aloha, Oregon semiconductor fabrication plant produces semiconductor chips for use in computers
and other electronic devices.  An iterative sequence of steps, including application of photoresist, UV light
exposure, developing, etching, rinsing with deionized water, doping, and rinsing with acid and solvent is
employed to transform silicon wafers into semiconductors.  Plant air emissions consist of VOCs and organic
and inorganic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from production processes and cleaning activities, as well as
criteria pollutants from on-site boilers.  The flexible permit was designed to rely primarily on a campaign of
P2 to advance approve a myriad of small equipment changes and process modifications.
Lasco Bathware - Yelm, Washington
Lasco’s Yelm source produces fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) bathtubs, shower stalls, and whirlpools.
The source operates a gelcoat line and an acrylic line.  Coats of plastic and fiber-reinforced resins are
sprayed in successive layers into molds (gelcoat line) or on preformed acrylic plastic sheets (acrylic line).
Styrene emissions result from the spray booth operations.  Lasco, through P2, limited its emissions per unit
of production so as to allow greater overall production under its emissions cap.  During the flexible permit
term, Lasco also installed a regenerative thermal oxidizer to control these VOC emissions from various steps
in the gelcoat line.
Saturn Corporation - Spring Hill, Tennessee
Saturn operates an integrated automotive production plant that produces a range of Saturn-brand vehicles.
Production, which peaked in 1996 at 314,035 vehicles, has declined in recent years due to weakness in the
subcompact car market segment.  The flexible PSD permit, issued in June 2000, has enabled Saturn to retool
to produce a new, fuel-efficient sport utility vehicle, the Saturn VUE™.  VOC emissions result from the
vehicle paint lines and the lost-foam aluminum foundry operations.  VOC emissions are controlled by eleven
recuperative thermal oxidizers, two regenerative thermal oxidizers, and a hybrid carbon adsorption/thermal
oxidation system.  Criteria pollutants arise from operation of the pollution control equipment, ovens, boilers,
and other miscellaneous natural gas combustion sources.  The Saturn PAL PSD permit is a hybrid permit
consisting of a PSD permit for a major expansion with permitted emissions based on projected future actual
emissions in combination with a PSD permit for existing emissions units with allowable emissions based on
current actual emissions at the existing emissions units.

II.  Findings
Drawing on information collected through the Flexible Permit Implementation Review, the EPA identified the
following findings.  Where appropriate, specific examples are drawn from the six individual permit
implementation experiences.  Readers should refer to the six Permit Review Reports for the full details of
the individual permit reviews.
Finding 1: The flexible permits contain adequate measures to assure
compliance with all applicable requirements.
Evaluation of the design adequacy of the flexible permits requires consideration of the objectives of the permit
developers.  Permitting authorities generally had two primary objectives in mind.  The first was to ensure that
all applicable air requirements were met.  This design objective meant that the flexible permits were
developed to function within the current regulatory framework without new rulemakings.  The permit design
teams believed that it was imperative to address all substantive requirements (e.g., technology, emissions
performance, or work practice requirements) and procedural requirements (e.g., public notification, review,
and comment processes; and reporting and information availability requirements).  If any applicable
requirement were omitted, this could necessitate obtaining construction approval and/or revising the operating
permit solely to address the missing applicable requirement.  This would erode most, if not all, of the potential
benefits from advance approval of the other applicable requirements.  The design challenge was to do so
through techniques and altered administrative practices that would improve company and permitting authority
operational performance and promote P2.  The second design objective focused on improving the
performance, or outcomes, achieved under the permit when compared with performance that would likely
be experienced under a conventional permit.  Specific aspects of this performance improvement goal are
addressed later in this report.
All of the permitting authorities stated that the flexible permits were fully supported by current Federal and
State rules.  They believed that no rulemaking was required to support any of the flexible permitting efforts.
While many of the flexibility techniques are not explicitly described or addressed in existing rules, the
permitting authorities determined that current rules accommodated the flexible permits, since no existing
regulation expressly precluded them and because the approaches did not bypass established substantive and
procedural regulatory requirements.
In several cases, rule interpretations were important to enable certain flexibility provisions.
•
Oregon DEQ and OAPCA representatives both reported that their ability to interpret “emissions unit”
as an entire production line or building, as opposed to a specific piece of equipment or process step,
was instrumental to enabling the advance approval provisions.
•
DNREC determined that it had the ability to allow advance approvals in a manner consistent with
construction time limit requirements.
The EPA found no evidence indicating that any air-related requirements applicable to the sources and their
advance approved changes were missed during permit development.  The EPA also found that the flexible
permits adequately identified all requirements applicable to the advance approved changes.

17
17
The flexible permits contained adequate monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting mechanisms to
ensure that regulatory requirements are met and that appropriate measures are in place.
Permitting authorities and the EPA found that the flexible permits included monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting (MRR) approaches that are appropriate given source operations.  They also found that MRR
approaches used in the flexible permits are sufficient to determine ongoing compliance with the permit
conditions and applicable requirements.  Table 2.1 summarizes the MRR requirements contained in the
flexible permits (see end of report).  Please refer to the Permit Review Reports for a more detailed discussion
on the design adequacy of MRR approaches used in the six flexible permits.  In several cases, the permitting
authorities required enhanced MRR requirements to ensure that plant demonstration of compliance with
established emissions caps was performed on a more frequent basis.  These measures were partly designed
to enable sources and permitting authorities to quickly identify problems or trends that could result in potential
emissions cap exceedances, reducing the risk and potential severity of permit violations.
•
3M’s St. Paul tape plant was required to calculate daily and rolling annual emissions totals within 41
hours of the end of each day, comparing these totals with the established VOC emissions caps.
•
DaimlerChrysler was required to submit monthly reports to DNREC documenting plant-wide VOC
and NOx emissions in tons per year for the previous 12 months, as well as plant-wide daily emissions
totals for the month.
In all cases, plant-wide emissions totals and calculations that demonstrated the companies’ compliance with
applicable emissions caps were required to be maintained on-site and were available to agency inspectors
upon request.  The EPA did, however, identify areas in which several of the flexible permits could be
improved to ensure that specific monitoring techniques are consistent with current EPA guidance.  The EPA
did not find that any of these areas for improvement affected the companies’ abilities to monitor actual
emissions, or to ensure compliance with the emissions caps or advance approved change provisions.
However, the EPA Review Team recommends that these improvements be considered in subsequent
versions of the permits.  Several of these recommendations are summarized below.
•
Although the monitoring requirements for the VOC scrubber for Intel’s Fab 4 at the Aloha plant used
an appropriate methodology (i.e., operating parameter monitoring), the elements of the monitoring
approach, were they relevant to the companies’ ability to assure compliance, could be improved by
including an operation and maintenance requirement that relates water flow rate with the flow
corresponding to the optimum VOC removal efficiency, as verified through source testing.
•
The EPA found that Saturn is conducting appropriate monitoring for the emissions caps, and has
submitted a complete monitoring protocol to TDEC, in accordance with permit condition C.2.  The
EPA recommends the addition of several specific monitoring procedures and performance indicator
ranges in the final Title V permit.  These recommended measures are associated with monitoring of
the carbon bed adsorber control equipment.
•
For the Imation permit, the EPA found that continuous measurement of the air flow rate from coaters
12W and 15W and going to the catalytic oxidizer is appropriate parametric monitoring for monitoring
capture efficiency.  However, the permit did not identify any indicator range for this parameter (i.e.,
an operating range outside of which a deviation would require corrective action and reporting was
not identified).  Current monitoring guidance would recommend establishing such an indicator range.
The periodic monitoring of capture efficiency and control device performance using inlet and outlet
THC measurements was identified as an appropriate technique.

3At the time of the EPA site visit in June 2001, the 3M St. Paul Tape Plant was operating under its State air
operating permit, although the advance-approval conditions in the permit expired in March 1998.  The plant has
submitted its Title V permit application and is awaiting its draft Title V permit.
19
19
Implementation of flexible permit monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting provisions was consistent
with that envisioned and intended during permit design.
Permitting authorities reported that the sources’ implementation of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting
(MRR) requirements was consistent with that intended during permit development.  They also found that the
scope, timing, and availability of MRR information was sufficient for the permitting authorities to monitor
companies’ compliance with permit conditions and applicable requirements.  In two cases, adjustments were
made to clarify or alter MRR requirements during permit implementation.
•
During a 1995 inspection, MPCA identified potential deficiencies in the recordkeeping approach for
temperature monitoring of the thermal oxidizer emissions control device at 3M’s St. Paul Tape Plant.
3M was able to demonstrate that no violations of the control device temperature level or the VOC
emissions cap had occurred.  3M and MPCA clarified and agreed on an acceptable approach for
recording future control device temperature readings.
•
In 1996, MPCA eliminated the requirement for a ten-day advance written notice from 3M of changes
implemented under permit condition 2.3.4.  MPCA reported that the agency believed that the post-
commencement notice for changes (submitted within two weeks of an actual change) was sufficient
to provide the agency and the public with a documented record of advance approved changes
actually made at the source.
Certain topics related to the renewal of flexible permits warrant further thinking to clarify acceptable
approaches.
While the flexible permits operated well during the initial permit terms, companies and permitting authorities
identified two areas that could benefit from further thinking and clarification.  The first involves clarifying
acceptable approaches for updating PALs at permit renewal.  Companies and permitting authorities indicated
that revising PAL levels based on the average of actual emissions for the prior two years (or some similar
approach) can create disincentives for emissions reductions and P2 if the correction is too extreme.  At the
same time, permitting authorities and companies acknowledged that some approach for revising PAL levels
at permit renewal is important to address new considerations that may have arisen, such as new applicable
requirements or changes in local air quality or attainment status.
The second area involves the clarification of acceptable approaches to transition back to conventional
permitting approaches if flexible permits are allowed to expire and the company or permitting authority does
not wish to renew the flexibility provisions.  For example, in the case of the 3M St. Paul Tape Plant flexible
permit, the advance approved change provisions expired at the end of the permit term, while the plant-wide
VOC emissions cap has remained in place.3  This has raised questions regarding what level of changes (if
any) would be allowed before New Source Review (NSR) would be triggered.

4The number of inspections conducted of sources with flexible permits by the time of the EPA’s review
varied primarily based on the length of time the source had been operating under the flexible permit.  Permitting
authorities typically reported that they conduct annual inspections of the sources, although in some cases (e.g.,
MPCA’s inspection of 3M’s St. Paul Tape Plant) the frequency of inspections was reduced as permitting authorities
focused on higher priority activities (e.g., issuance of Title V permits).
20
20
Finding 2: The flexible permits were considered to be enforceable by permitting
authorities and EPA.
A key objective of the EPA’s Flexible Permit Implementation Review was to verify that company compliance
with the flexible permits is enforceable in a practical manner by permitting authorities and the EPA.
Permitting authorities expressed their belief that the flexible permit provisions are practicably enforceable,
and the EPA agrees with these permitting authority assertions based on the findings from the reviews of the
six flexible permits.
The flexible permits contain sufficient monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements to
enable permitting authorities and the EPA to assure compliance.
Permitting authorities believe that the flexible permits are enforceable in a practical manner.  They believe
that they have the ability to detect source compliance with the flexibility provisions, as well as all applicable
requirements, based on the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements established in the permits.
Permitting authorities further reported that their experiences during implementation of the permits confirmed
that the flexible permits are enforceable in practice.  See Finding 1 above for additional discussion of the
adequacy of permit design related to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
The EPA agrees with the permitting authorities’ statements regarding the ability to determine company
compliance with permit conditions and applicable requirements based on the findings from this review.  The
EPA found the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting information implemented by the companies for
calculating emissions and determining control equipment parameter values to be sufficient to determine
compliance.  The EPA Review Team was able to reproduce the exact compliance values for each flexible
permit using actual emissions and monitoring data (e.g., material usage data, VOC content data, control device
parameter data) and established emissions calculations procedures.  The EPA found that all data necessary
to perform compliance verification calculations was available and well-organized at the sources.
Permitting authorities reported that conducting inspections of sources with flexible permits is
comparable to conducting inspections of sources with conventional permits.
While the number of inspections conducted by permitting authorities varied, permitting authorities generally
indicated that inspecting sources with flexible permits was straightforward and comparable to conducting
inspections for sources with conventional permits.4  A few permitting authorities stated that some up-front
education was required of permitting authority inspectors to ensure their familiarity with the flexibility
provisions in the permits.  They indicated such orientation was necessary since the flexible permits contained
some requirements not typically required in conventional permits, such as on-site logs of alternate operating
scenarios and changes implemented under the advance approval provisions, as well as plant-wide emissions
calculations.

21
21
In some cases, permitting authorities indicated that the flexible permits resulted in less difficult or time-
consuming inspections.  This was primarily attributed to the reduced need to verify compliance with numerous
requirements for specific equipment or activities that are commonly included in conventional permits (e.g.,
limitations on production rates for process lines, equipment, or process level emissions).  Instead, inspectors
were able to direct attention to ensuring compliance with the plant-wide emissions limits.
Finding 3: The flexible permits facilitated and encouraged emissions reductions
and pollution prevention.
The flexible permits were designed to bring sharper attention to the current level of actual plant-wide
emissions and emissions per unit of production.  While the permits generally did not require actual emissions
reductions during the permit term, they contained provisions to facilitate and encourage emissions reductions
and P2.  The permit implementation experience, supported by statements from the sources and permitting
authorities, indicates that the permits were effective in facilitating emissions reductions and P2.  Of the five
sources which had been operating under their flexible permits for three or more years, all five accomplished
a significant lowering of actual plant-wide emissions and/or emissions per unit of production.  Achieving such
environmental benefits was attributed by the companies to several factors, as discussed below.
Companies accomplished a significant lowering of actual plant-wide emissions and/or emissions per
unit of production during their flexible permit terms.
•
3M lowered its actual VOC emissions from 4,300 tons/year to 700 tons/year due to increased
pollution control device capture of VOCs, greater use of voluntary controls, P2, and reduced
production.
•
DaimlerChrysler lowered its actual VOC emissions from 1,165 tons/year to 776 tons/year, primarily
through P2 associated with vehicle coatings and plant solvent usage.
•
Lasco tested its emission factor as part of developing its flexible permit, leading to a voluntary
reduction in emissions of approximately 100 tons/year prior to obtaining the flexible permit.  During
the permit term, Lasco implemented P2 measures and installed a thermal oxidizer to increase
production while remaining under the emissions cap.  These efforts resulted in per unit emissions
reductions of approximately 32 percent.
•
Using P2 projects, Intel lowered its actual VOC emissions over three-fold, from 190 tons/year to 56
tons/year, to become a synthetic minor source while simultaneously increasing production.
•
As Saturn had only operated under the flexible permit for 13 months (at the time EPA’s review was
conducted), it is difficult to determine trends in VOC emissions per unit of production.  VOC
emissions for the first year of the flexible permit implementation were about 580 tons/year, compared
with 798 tons/year in the year prior to the issuance of the flexible permit (1999).
•
Imation reported that it has achieved about an 11 percent reduction in the pounds of VOC emissions
generated per unit of production in 2000 when compared with 1997 baseline levels.
Companies reported that the plant-wide emissions caps focused organizational attention on reducing
plant-wide emissions.
Several of the flexible permits shifted the allowable level of plant-wide emissions downward.

The flexible permit for 3M’s St. Paul Tape Plant enforceably limited VOC emissions to less than half
those previously emitted by this source.  With respect to actual emissions, MPCA indicated that the
State of Minnesota does not have a technology requirement (such as one for best available state-of-
the-art technology) as part of their State minor New Source Review program.  As a result, air
pollution sources are in a position to maintain their historical emissions and to increase their emissions
in 39-ton increments through minor changes on an ongoing basis.  Under the flexible permit in 1993,
3M became subject to an annual VOC emissions cap of 4,283 tons.  Prior to the flexible permit, 3M
was “grandfathered” to emit up to 65,000 tons annually.  In 1988, 3M had 10,600 tons of actual VOC
emissions and then voluntarily installed controls, bringing emissions down to 4,300 tons/year in 1991.
•
The establishment of VOC PALs for the Saturn plant was part of a PSD permit revision process to
allow approximately a doubling of production capacity.  Even with a substantial increase in production
capacity, the new PSD permit (including incorporation of VOC PALs) sets maximum VOC
emissions at a level of about 50 percent of the allowable VOC emissions under the original,
superceded PSD permit for the plant.
•
Imation’s flexible Title V permit extended emissions limits to the 12W coating line that was previously
“grandfathered” under the Clean Air Act.  Without the voluntary emissions controls that Imation
installed (prior to the flexible permit), the coating line had a potential to emit (PTE) of approximately
4,000 tons/year of VOC.  The permit enforceably limited VOC emissions to one site-wide cap of 249
tons/year, creating “synthetic minor” status for purposes of PSD applicability.  Imation could have
requested two such caps since its operations at Weatherford involved two separate sources [i.e,
different operations with different Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes].
While limits on allowable emissions do not necessarily affect actual emissions, several of the companies
reported that the emissions caps had a “focusing effect,” drawing company personnel’s attention to managing
activities so as to minimize plant-wide emissions.  They added that conventional air permits typically contain
a more diffuse set of emissions limitations on specific equipment or production lines that lack this focusing
effect.  With company attention focused on managing plant-wide emissions levels in relation to an emissions
cap, several companies reported that this created structural incentives for the companies to pursue emissions
reduction opportunities that increase the margin of compliance - the difference between the emissions cap
and actual emissions.  First, companies indicated that emissions reductions result in larger compliance margins
that typically reduce the risk of non-compliance associated with emissions cap exceedances.  Second, per unit
emissions reductions can create room under the cap to accommodate future production increases.
•
Lasco representatives indicated that the 249 tons/year PTE cap on VOC emissions created a strong
P2 and emissions reduction incentive, particularly since the source’s margin of compliance was not
large (e.g., actual emissions were 244.5 in 1998) and since the cap created a real production
constraint.
•
DaimlerChrysler representatives reported that the flexible permit conditions are easier to
communicate to operations personnel since the focus on a plant-wide emissions cap and P2 is more
intuitive and provides more “clarity of focus” than specific equipment or production line requirements.
As a result, it has been easier to engage operations personnel in exploring and implementing P2
projects under the flexible permit.  By eliminating numerous requirements on individual emissions
sources at the plant, the flexible permit has also complemented DaimlerChrysler’s lean manufacturing
initiatives designed to reduce complexity throughout the plant.
While emissions caps, in general, can encourage emissions reductions, certain permit designs can also create
disincentives for reducing emissions.  As mentioned above, several companies voiced a major concern that

23
23
their over-control and/or use of P2 to create emissions “head room” under an emissions cap could be lost due
to five year contemporaneous “ratcheting.”  A significant compliance margin between actual emissions and
applicable emissions caps is desired by sources to buffer against risk of emissions cap exceedances and to
accommodate production fluctuations linked to changing market demand for plant products.  Companies
indicated that a counter-productive “ratcheting” situation can arise if a PAL is totally adjusted downward at
permit renewal to reflect recent actual emissions levels (e.g., average of prior two years actual annual
emissions).
Advance approved change provisions reduced the administrative “friction” associated with P2
changes, making such changes more attractive for companies to undertake.
Advance approval provisions for selected operational, equipment, and raw material changes can significantly
reduce the administrative “friction” of making changes, including delay and costs for undertaking
modifications that have P2 benefits.  Companies indicated that under conventional permits, administrative
friction often arises from two activities.  First, desired changes are typically evaluated by company
environmental personnel to determine whether any regulatory requirements apply to or are triggered by the
desired modification.  Several companies reported that such applicability determinations are often not
straightforward, and that they frequently require careful interpretation and necessitate seeking guidance or
clarifications from the permitting authority.  Second, changes triggering minor NSR are typically subjected
to a notice of construction permitting process to seek approval from the permitting authority in advance of
initiating the modification.  Staff time needed to conduct applicability determinations and individual permit
applications increases transaction costs for each modification.  Additionally, the time frame between when
the desired change is first identified and when it is reviewed and permitted can extend beyond the company’s
desired implementation time frame, resulting in a disincentive to change.
Companies reported that modifications designed to improve resource productivity, process efficiency, or
reduce pollution are often implemented in an iterative manner, as source personnel initiate a modification,
observe and measure results, and then make further refinements to optimize system performance.  This could
involve trying multiple raw materials to find one with optimal product quality and emissions performance
characteristics.  Several companies indicated that under such iterative change processes, increased
transaction costs and time delays - or even perceived uncertainty about such costs and delays - can produce
significant “barriers to entry,” causing the plant to forego modifications with positive environmental outcomes
that lack significant strategic, operational, or competitiveness advantages.  
•
For example, Intel representatives indicated that operations personnel are less willing to engage with
environmental staff in exploring potential P2 opportunities if they perceive that there is a significant
potential for delay or time intensive regulatory evaluations and communications.  Due to the iterative
nature of many P2 projects, operations personnel typically need to conduct a series of experiments
on a manufacturing process to see if the changes produce the desired results.  Intel indicated that
many of these individual changes could be subject to individual construction permitting actions thus
imposing a very jagged, stop-and-go aspect to the experimentation process.  Intel indicated that, under
such conditions, operations personnel might well view experimentation for purposes of pollution
prevention as being too disruptive of the manufacturing process to proceed.
Even when emissions-reducing projects “pay” (e.g., exhibit a positive return on investment), increased
transaction costs, time delays, and uncertainty can reduce the projects’ ability to compete effectively for
internal resources and organizational attention.  The net result can be environmental benefits left on the table.

24
24
Companies reported that advance approval provisions can significantly improve the attractiveness of making
modifications that result in reduced emissions by reducing their transaction costs and the potential for time
delays.  The examples below illustrate ways in which utilization of advance approved change provisions
facilitated P2 activities at several of the sources with flexible permits.
•
Between 1994 and 1998, Intel’s Aloha plant made at least 18 P2-related equipment and material
changes, utilizing the permit’s advance approval provisions, that resulted in VOC emissions reductions
of over 100 tons/year.
•
DaimlerChrysler’s NAP has undertaken numerous P2 activities utilizing the advance-approved
change provisions in their flexible permit, including steps to reduce VOC and HAP emissions from
vehicle coating processes.  DaimlerChrysler representatives reported that, in the absence of a flexible
permit, the source might have still pursued some of these P2 initiatives, but that they may well  have
been delayed to coincide with permit renewal time frames due to the cost and staff resources
required to secure case-by-case permit approvals.  They emphasized that the flexible permits
significantly reduce the regulatory friction associated with making P2 changes, increasing incentives
for P2.
•
Lasco representatives stated that the flexibility provisions allowed the Yelm plant to test and
undertake changes that reduced styrene emissions without having to wait for conventional case-by-
case permit approval.  The advance approved change provisions substantially increased the likelihood
that Lasco would actually research and implement such changes, due to Lasco’s corporate
reluctance to undertake changes that would trigger NSR permitting actions.  Lasco has implemented
several changes utilizing the advance approval provisions that have reduced emissions, including
installation of a new putty station and expansion of emissions control capacity.
Several flexible permits increased company awareness and focus on pollution prevention through
explicit P2 program, reporting, and performance requirements.
Four of the flexible permits contained explicit conditions requiring the companies to implement formal P2
programs, report on P2 performance, and/or meet certain P2 performance targets.  While these companies
had histories of P2 accomplishment prior to issuance of the flexible permits, the companies generally reported
that the explicit P2 permit conditions served to increase the visibility of P2 among plant personnel.  When
combined with the new focus on managing plant-wide emissions against a cap and the relative administrative
ease for accomplishing such changes under the advance approval provisions, the P2 commitments and
programs have empowered some company environmental personnel to expand P2 activities.
•
Intel found that the flexible permit provided clear incentives to favor P2 over new emissions control
technology for meeting the required source-specific, performance-based VOC Reasonably Available
Control Technology (RACT) determination (permit condition 14).  The explicit focus on P2 in the
permit increased environmental personnel’s leverage in their efforts to engage operations personnel
in exploring and implementing P2 efforts.
•
The P2 performance requirement included in the DaimlerChrysler NAP’s flexible permit has
prompted a clear organizational focus on reducing VOC emissions associated with vehicle coating
operations.  DaimlerChrysler is to begin utilizing a powder clearcoat by September 2003 if it is
commercially available; if not, the company is to employ P2 measures that will reduce topcoat VOC
emissions to below seven pounds of VOCs per gallon of applied coating solids on a daily weighted
basis until a powder clearcoat option is commercially available.
•
Even though a Washington State P2 expert familiar with the RFP industry identified Lasco as a “first

25
25
in class” pollution preventer, Lasco found that the flexible permit encouraged and facilitated company
efforts to pursue additional P2 opportunities.  To fulfill the flexible permit’s P2 program requirement
(which is linked to Lasco’s BACT determination for advance approved changes), Lasco instituted
a “P2 Task Force” at the Yelm plant.  The task force is charged with identifying P2 opportunities and
coordinating P2 activities throughout the plant.  Lasco representatives stated that its employees are
now more cognizant of how source emissions affect the community and of the importance of P2 as
a result of the flexible permit development process and the increased organizational focus on P2.
•
As part of its required P2 program, Imation conducted routine P2 meetings with a cross-functional
team of plant managers and personnel at the Weatherford plant.  P2 training for plant employees and
research and development staff further heightened organizational focus on identifying P2
opportunities.  Imation representatives also reported that the formal tracking of progress towards the
plant’s ten percent emissions reduction goal (i.e., based on emissions per unit of production) has
increased plant personnel’s awareness of and attentiveness to P2.
Finding 4:  Companies with the flexible permits believe that air permitting is on
their critical response path.
Companies participating in the review reported that conventional permits can constrain their ability to compete
effectively.  Though the factors differ somewhat for each source, the companies indicated that the
combination of increasingly globalized competition and a shift to new modes of production substantially
increased the pressure to operate highly flexible, nimble, and responsive research, development, and
production operations.  In this context, conventional, case-by-case air permitting, which the companies state
can cause delay and uncertainty, can act as a mission-critical bottleneck to their operations.
Global competition across multiple industry sectors has shortened product life-cycles and increased
the importance of moving new products quickly from development to market.
Companies report that global competition, which intensified during the 1990s through the integration of
financial markets, reductions in trade barriers (e.g., NAFTA), increased industrial development in Asia and
other regions, and substantially shortened product development time frames, has exposed U.S.-based
operations to more and often lower cost producers.  Examples of specific company competitiveness needs
include the following.
•
Intel reported that it operates in a highly competitive market and needs to meet aggressive product
development schedules.  Intel currently introduces a new generation of semiconductor chips every
12 to 24 months, with each new product cycle supported by a major “fab revamp.”  These
operational changes are very time sensitive, to meet product release schedules from computer and
electronics manufacturers, and involve highly interdependent and sequenced steps.
•
3M management indicated that the reduction in trade barriers associated with NAFTA and other
international trade agreements, combined with the overall globalization of competition and the ability
of potential competitors to purchase and install rapidly ""off-the-shelf"" production equipment, enables
other companies to reach rapidly into 3M's market share with low cost product.  In this context, 3M
reports that ""first to market"" (where a week delay can be very significant) has become a critical
business success factor, particularly in specialty product markets, such as the automotive and medical
sectors.  3M reported that many specialty tape products become obsolete, and are replaced by newer

26
26
products, within six to nine months of initial production.
•
DaimlerChrysler indicated that its vehicle development process, in part due to advances in
computer-assisted design, has decreased from five years to about 18 months, substantially reducing
its ability to accommodate conventional permitting time frames while meeting product development
schedules.
•
Saturn indicated that the automotive market has shifted significantly in recent years, necessitating
more rapid responsiveness to market demands.  In this context, Saturn has recently expanded its
available product line and expects further changes in the near future, each of which requires
significant production line retooling and process adjustments.  Saturn also indicated that the vehicle
development process has significantly shortened from five years to about 18 months.  Previous lead
times allowed ample time, in most cases, to secure needed permits while remaining on product
development and release schedules.  Under the new time frames, air permitting is now on its critical
path.
Advance production concepts, designed to help firms compete effectively, encourage rapid, and
sometimes iterative operational and equipment changes to continuously improve resource productivity,
operational efficiency, and product quality.
Production theory and techniques have undergone substantial revision with emphasis placed on continuous
resource productivity improvements.  This emphasis - as reflected in such advanced production concepts as
Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma - substantially influences the day-to-day operating environments at many
companies.  These systems are characterized by a major drive to increase the velocity of production
processes (reduce the time required to transform raw materials into product), increase asset utilization and
cash flow, substantially shorten research and development time frames, continually improve process yields,
and respond to heightened customer expectations for quality, product features, and delivery responsiveness.
Specific examples from the permit reviews include the following.
•
Intel reported a need to make rapid (and sometimes iterative) process and equipment adjustments in
production processes to improve yield, lower costs, reduce chemical usage, and otherwise improve
operations.  Many of these changes involve switching chemicals used in tools and process chemical
formulations, adjusting gas flow rates, and moving or adding tools (e.g., photo lithography equipment,
plasma etchers, liquid acid baths).
•
3M indicated that, in response to competitive pressures, it is involved in a major corporate-wide drive
to reduce cycle times and improve asset utilization and cash flow.  These initiatives require for their
success an in-plant culture of continual improvement and substantial flexibility for production
operations.
•
Lasco indicated that the key focus in the bathtub industry is making minor product modifications on
an ongoing basis (rather than launching major new products like in the semiconductor industry).  In
this context, Lasco's competitive strategy focuses on continually increasing material yields, which
requires seeking ways to utilize less and/or increase the capture of its input materials on a per unit
basis.  Lasco also needed flexibility to change production lines rapidly to accommodate different
product types as short-term demand fluctuated among them.
•
Saturn identified factory “agility” as a key to its ability to compete within the General Motors network
of plants for new product lines, citing its flexible permit (and the factory responsiveness it provided)
as a critical factor in its selection to produce the L850 “world engine.”
•
Imation representatives indicated that the company desired to use the Weatherford plant to
experiment with and pilot new coating technologies and product recipes to respond quickly to changes

27
27
in customer demand, as well as new production innovation opportunities.  These changes involve
short-term experimental use of manufacturing equipment, at times requiring changes to equipment
configurations and the emissions profiles of the equipment.  Imation further indicated that  market
demands frequently require rapid process changes, including substituting or introducing new raw
material, relocating, modifying or adding new equipment, and/or interchanging pollution control
devices.
Companies indicated that responding effectively to increasingly industry competitiveness requires operating
environments capable of responding rapidly to changing market circumstances (e.g., develop and introduce
new products rapidly and adjust production to address customer requests), moving production rapidly among
facilities to achieve optimal asset utilization, and generally engendering a culture of continual operational
improvement.  The companies indicated that this results in an operating environment where changes to
equipment, operating parameters, equipment configurations, and locations are more common and are often
subject to tight deadlines.
Companies report that conventional permitting can be problematic due to the potential delay and
uncertainty associated with such actions.
Although some variability exists, Federal and State and local air permitting rules generally prohibit an air
pollution source from constructing, modifying, reconstructing, or operating an emissions unit, stationary source,
or control device without explicit approval (typically in the form of an air permit or permit modification
undertaken on a case-by-case basis at the time a source desires a change).  The typical process for obtaining
any needed New Source Review (NSR) approval involves the following:
•
Communicating the nature of prospective changes to the permitting authority and discussions to
determine if NSR would apply.
•
Determining all the applicable regulatory requirements that the desired change would “trigger.”
•
Preparing and submitting any necessary permit application providing the details of the desired change.
In many cases, permitting authorities may request additional information before a source’s permit
application is considered to be complete.
•
Reviewing the application at the permitting authority and framing a draft permit (to ensure all
applicable requirements are met, air quality protection is maintained, and needed technology
requirements are imposed).
•
Seeking and addressing public comments on the draft permit or permit modification, if required by
Federal, State, or local rules governing the applicable requirements.  In some cases, this step may
involve public hearings.
•
Issuance of the permit or revision required to undertake the change.
Permitting authorities reported that this process can take as little as 30 days (for a minor change that does
not require public comment), but can extend to six or more months depending on the type of change,
environmental impacts, applicable requirements, and public concerns.  A typical time frame (required or
strongly suggested by agency rules) for most minor source construction permit actions is 90 to 180 days,
although certain permitting authorities indicated that past or current permit back logs inhibit their ability to
respond within these time frames.  Some states such as Oregon have provisions that allow ""minor"" operational
changes (as defined by their specific rules) to proceed in parallel with the permitting process.  Companies
indicated that they utilize this option with some hesitancy since the outcome of the review is uncertain and
the consequences of failing to obtain the permit (or be subject to an unexpected requirement) can be

28
28
substantial.
Companies indicated that this case-by-case permit process can introduce significant delay and uncertainty
into their operational decision-making and research, development, and production activities.  Although
case-by-case permitting actions can impose administrative costs from applicability determinations and permit
application development, companies’ concerns focused on the potential opportunity costs and competitiveness
costs associated with delay and uncertainty in the permit process.
Companies reported that operational change delay results from the need to obtain a permit prior to
“constructing” each planned operational change (or aggregated group of changes).  In the new competitive
environment described by the companies, they often do not have substantial advance notice of the specific
operational changes needed to address customer demands or market opportunities.  As a result, the need to
delay implementation of the change to meet conventional permitting requirements can lead to lost market
opportunity.  Companies further indicated that many of the continual resource productivity improvements they
desire to undertake require experimentation and highly iterative process changes.  In this context, the need
to obtain a permit before each iterative step turns continual improvement into an uncertain process that
operations managers are disinclined to undertake.
•
Intel identified 150 to 200 changes per year that they believe would have triggered minor NSR
permitting.  This number of changes, combined with the Oregon DEQ approval time frame of up to
60 days per change, suggest that there would likely have been significant delay under a conventional
permit.  Even if few delays would have resulted in production downtime or missed market
opportunities, the costs would likely have been significant under a conventional permitting scenario,
as many of the changes improved the cost-competitiveness of Intel’s products through resource
productivity improvements.  Industry estimates of the opportunity costs of production downtime and
time delays run as high as several million dollars in just a few days, due to lost sales to computer
makers and other factors.  Intel representatives indicated that the impact of continued time delays
would likely be to redirect Intel’s production investment and operating facilities to locations where
changes could be accommodated within existing environmental regulations (e.g., other U.S. States
or to other countries where Intel operates, such as Ireland or Israel) as they had done prior to
receiving their flexible permit.
•
DaimlerChrysler and General Motors (Saturn’s parent company) reported that they have experienced
PSD review processes lasting more than 2 years.
Several of the companies indicated that uncertainty in the permitting process creates ""friction"" for the
operational change process because it increases risk.  Companies indicated that uncertainty emerges from
a number of aspects of the permitting process.  First, companies reported that they are at times unsure about
the applicability of permitting requirements to maintenance, repair, and replacement activities.  Second, future
permit requirements can be unpredictable due to the discretion inherent in setting emissions limits, making
technology determinations, and establishing monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.  Third, the
length of the permit review and approval process can be unpredictable, due to such factors as permitting
authority backlogs and the degree of public interest.  According to the companies, these factors combine to
make it difficult for a company to accurately estimate the time frame and cost of a permitting action and,
therefore, how the need to permit will affect the financial attractiveness and overall viability of an operational
change.
Companies with flexible permits stated that they have similar needs at other facilities and are

29
29
interested in pursuing flexible permits for those facilities.
The six companies reported that they have identified similar flexibility needs at other facilities, and they
expressed interest in pursuing flexible permits for those facilities.  For example:
•
Imation’s Camarillo, California source has been issued a flexible permit through the EPA’s Project
XL initiative, modeled in several respects on the Weatherford permit.  Imation representatives stated
that they believe the flexibility techniques used in the Weatherford permit would be beneficial to other
Imation facilities as well.
•
DaimlerChrysler pointed to a plant in the Midwest as a primary example of the company’s need to
expand the use of flexible permitting approaches to other facilities.  The plant’s eight existing permits
have multiple, unit-specific technology limits, emissions limits for different time periods, and a variety
of operating conditions specific to each emissions unit, for a total of 128 specific permit conditions
(as compared to only 16 for the Newark Assembly Plant’s permit).  Since the late 1980s, the source
has been addressing permit modifications and other concerns on a continuous basis.  More
specifically, since 1992 the plant obtained 12 permits or permit revisions, with two involving Federal
NSR.  Three recent amendments took, on average, over a year to complete.  DaimlerChrysler
believes that had the plant been operating under a flexible permit, this number of permit transactions
could have been reduced to only two, saving time and money as well as facilitating timely completion
of P2 activities.  DaimlerChrysler representatives indicated that the company has set a goal of having
flexible permits for all DaimlerChrysler facilities in the U.S. within two years.  However,
DaimlerChrysler reported that permitting authorities in several other States are opting to hold off on
negotiating such permits until EPA guidance and/or rulemaking are complete.
Finding 5: Companies with the flexible permits utilized their flexibility
provisions.
Flexibility provision utilization during the permit terms exhibited rates and types of changes consistent
with the needs expressed by the companies during permit development.
All of the companies have utilized advance approval provisions contained in their flexible permits.
•
As mentioned, Intel reported that the Aloha plant made an average of approximately 150 to 200
operational and equipment modifications per year during the Title V permit term that would likely
have been subject to Oregon’s case-by-case Notice of Construction approval process under a
conventional permit.  These changes, primarily associated with “fab revamps” to scale-up production
of new semiconductors and iterative changes to optimize existing production processes (including P2-
driven changes), were implemented using the advance approval provisions in the Title V permit.
•
3M made 34 equipment and operational changes that utilized the advance approval conditions.  3M
estimated that 15 to 20 of the changes would likely have required some form of permitting action
under Minnesota’s conventional permitting process, with two of these changes likely having triggered
at least case-by-case PSD permitting analyses.  3M indicated that the advance approval provisions
accommodated all of the source’s change needs (i.e., no additional construction permitting actions
were necessary), enabling the company to upgrade aging equipment and improve the yield and per
unit emissions performance associated with coating lines.

30
30
•
DaimlerChrysler’s NAP made over 90 operational and equipment changes utilizing the permits’
advance approval provisions between 1995 and 2000.  Advance approved modifications were made
to coating system components, coatings, cleaning activities, fuel-fired sources, source locations,
ventilation systems, and emissions control systems.
•
Lasco made five changes during the Title V permit term (as of July 2001) that utilized the advance
approval provisions.  The advance approvals enabled Lasco to add two new emissions units, increase
its stack height to remedy odor concerns, modify its emission factor to account for improved
emissions performance, and modify its control technology without requiring case-by-case permitting
actions.
•
Despite only having about one year of implementation experience under its flexible permit, Saturn has
made several of the changes outlined in its PSD permit application, including construction of the L850
engine line and the second assembly line in General Assembly.  Saturn reported that it is likely that
changes to existing emissions units have been made during the first year of the permit term (i.e., June
2000 to August 2001) that utilize the advance approval provision in permit condition B.10.1.  Saturn
is not required to maintain records of these changes, provided the changes meet established criteria
in the permit and plant-wide emissions remain below established caps.
•
Imation and Oklahoma DEQ reported that the Weatherford plant has made frequent use of the
flexibility provisions that advance-approve the use of alternative raw materials.  In at least four cases,
this included a streamlined toxics evaluation by the State, allowing the source to rapidly implement
raw material changes at the source.  Imation also utilized the advance approved alternative operating
scenarios for control devices and methods on three occasions.
 
In addition, some companies stated that the number of changes made is not the only indicator or importance
to them.  Equally important to them is the ability to make certain critical changes when other business factors
dictate.
Companies reported that the advanced approval provisions in the flexible permits fully addressed their
operational change needs.  With the exception of Lasco, the companies did not need to undertake any non-
advance approved construction permitting actions (e.g., minor NSR and major NSR) during their flexible
permit terms (i.e., typically a 5 year period).  Also, the permitting authorities indicated that the sources did not
make any changes under the advance approval provisions that were not authorized under the advance
approval provisions.
•
Lasco was required to submit a Notice of Construction permit application and seek a Title V permit
amendment to install a regenerative thermal oxidizer during the flexible permit term.  This was
necessary since this change was not advance approved in the permit, and since the change required
new MRR requirements.
Some companies did not utilize all of the flexibility provisions in their permits, but they anticipated
using these flexibility provisions in the future.
While all six companies utilized at least some of the flexibility provisions in their permits, not all flexibility
provisions had been used at the time of this review (with the exception of Intel).  Several sources indicated
that, while they can reasonably anticipate desired operational and equipment changes (or types of changes)
well in advance, the exact timing of change implementation is often influenced by multiple factors, such as
changing organizational investment priorities and resources and fluctuations in customer demand.  Companies
typically reported that they anticipate using their unused flexibility provisions later in their permit terms or

31
31
following permit renewal.  For example:
•
During the first 14 months under the flexible permit, Saturn did not implement the advance approval
provisions which allow construction of new emissions sources (i.e., permit condition B.10.2).  Saturn
and TDEC anticipate that this provision will be useful in the future to accommodate changes
associated with vehicle model year changeovers.
•
As of December 2001, the Weatherford site had not implemented two changes that were specifically
described in the advance approved minor NSR change provisions (i.e., permit condition Section H,
Subsection 2, Requirement 1b and 1c).  Imation indicated that the source may undertake these
changes in the future.
The flexible permits appear to accommodate a substantial number of advance approved changes while
providing sufficient clarity to support practical enforceability.
The permitting authorities indicated that the actual changes made under the flexible permits were fully
consistent with those envisioned during permit design and that the changes were made in a manner consistent
with the constraints imposed by the permits.  The flexible permits vary in the degree of specificity with which
advance approved modifications are described in the permits.  Each of the permits, however, imposes clear
boundaries for determining which changes would not be covered under the advance approval conditions.
Changes triggering new applicable requirements, including new or modified MRR requirements, that were
not already addressed in the permit, are subject to conventional permitting and approval procedures.
•
Changes advance approved in Intel’s Title V permit were clearly defined categorically and by
conditions documented in the permit.  For example, advance approved changes could only be made
at the stationary sources comprising Emissions Unit 1 (EU1); construction of entirely new stationary
sources are not covered; changes to a pollution control device are not covered; and no new applicable
requirement can be triggered by an advance approved change.  In addition, advance approved
changes must not result in source non-compliance with the VOC RACT requirement and the source
PSELs.
•
3M’s flexible permit contained specific categories of changes advance approved by the permit, such
as updating drive mechanisms and electrical components on coating equipment and replacing or
upgrading coater ovens, provided that 3M satisfied specific requirements described in the permit (e.g.,
remain below emissions caps and meet applicable New Source Performance Standards).  If 3M
desired to make a change not specifically covered by the listed advance approved categories of
changes, they would be required to proceed with a conventional permitting process for the
modification, unless MPCA agreed that the change was “consistent with” the changes advance
approved by the permit.
•
For DaimlerChrysler, some changes made under the flexible permit were not fully advance approved,
but were eligible to go through an expedited review process if all applicable requirements were met
and if no public hearing was requested during the public notice period.
Several companies reported that they did feel a need to contact their permitting authority during the permit
term to discuss or clarify whether a particular modification would be allowed under the advance approval
provisions in their pilot permit.
•
3M indicated that on two or three occasions, they contacted MPCA to discuss planned changes that
were not explicitly addressed by the permit but appeared to be covered by the “consistent with”

32
32
phrasing included in the permit. In each of these instances, MPCA indicated that the planned change
would not require a permitting action.
•
On one occasion, Lasco filed a Notice of Construction permit application to change the venting of
the regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO). After the application was submitted, OAPCA informed
Lasco that the proposed change was covered by the advance approval provisions and the application
was unnecessary.
Some companies indicated the flexible permits have facilitated an increase in the rate and a shift in
the type of changes made, when compared to a conventional permitting approach.
Some of the companies indicated that they would not have made certain changes, had such changes not been
advance approved in their flexible permit.  They typically stated that the time frames associated with
conventional minor NSR and other types of air permitting, as well as uncertainty regarding the applicability
of certain regulatory requirements, often creates sufficient “friction” (e.g., cost, delay, and risk) to make a
proposed change unattractive.  The EPA found evidence that proposed P2 changes are particularly vulnerable
to being shelved under a conventional permitting approach, since they often involve iterative experimentation
that could heighten regulatory transaction costs.  In addition, P2 modifications often receive lower
organizational investment priority unless they simultaneously address an important operational need.  Advance
approval provisions facilitated research and development into alternative processes.  When research
uncovered a promising process technique, the company could implement the change without waiting for case-
by-case approval and permitting.
 
•
Intel reported that successful pollution prevention initiatives directed at ongoing processes can be
iterative in nature.  The company typically conducts a series of experiments on its manufacturing
process to see if the changes produce the desired results.  Many of these individual changes could
be subject to construction permitting actions, thus imposing a stop-and-go aspect to the experimental
process.  Intel indicated that, under such conditions, operations personnel might well view
experimentation for purposes of pollution prevention as being very disruptive of the manufacturing
process and therefore recommend that it not proceed.
•
Lasco reported that the company is inclined not to make changes that have potential to trigger
additional air permitting requirements, attributing this reluctance to potential costs, delay, and
uncertainty associated with permitting actions.  For example, Lasco installed more complex putty
systems for attaching boards to the inside of bath units at other Lasco facilities to prevent the systems
from triggering air permitting requirements.  The advance approval provisions enabled Lasco to
incorporate a new putty station design into the product production line at the Yelm site in a
streamlined manner, resulting in material savings and VOC emissions reductions.
Finding 6: The flexible permits enhanced information sharing between the
companies and permitting authorities.
All six permitting authorities stated that the flexible permits enhanced their overall understanding of company
activities and emissions as compared to conventional permitting approaches.  The flexible permits did,
however, alter the timing and format of certain types of information, such as information regarding changes
implemented under advance approval provisions, when compared with information available under
conventional permits.  In several areas, such as plant-wide emissions performance and P2 performance, the

33
33
flexible permits typically required information that is not required by conventional permits.
The flexible permit development process provided permitting authorities with a clearer understanding
of the maximum plant-wide emissions levels anticipated during the permit terms.
The flexible permits provided clear information regarding the maximum level of emissions that would be
allowed during the permit term, in the form of established emissions caps.  If a source desired to exceed its
emissions cap, it would thereafter be required to undergo a major NSR permitting process that would require
public comment.  For example, in accepting the PTE cap of 249 tons/year of VOC emissions, Lasco had to
reduce its actual emissions, providing assurances to local residents that plant-wide emissions would thereafter
be held relatively steady, despite company plans to increase production during the permit term.
During permit development, companies were required to share more information regarding the type
of changes anticipated during the permit term, providing a more comprehensive, up-front picture of
anticipated operational activities and associated environmental performance than a conventional
permitting process.
The permitting authorities believe that the flexible permit development process, through the discussions of
advance approved changes, provided them with a clear advance understanding of the types of modifications
that the companies anticipated during the permit term.  Under a conventional permitting approach, change
information would typically only be available in a more fragmented, incremental manner, as companies
pursued approval to make changes on a case-by-case basis.  Under the flexible approach, applicable
requirements associated with each advance approved change are identified up-front in the permit, affording
a long-term view of potential applicable requirements, resulting emissions control requirements, and
environmental outcomes.  This enabled the permitting authority to have a more comprehensive picture of
changes, and associated environmental performance outcomes, that would likely occur over the permit term
(e.g., 5 years).
During permit implementation, information regarding changes made by the companies using the
advance approval provisions varied among the flexible permits but was generally comparable to or
greater than that produced under a conventional  permitting process; the flexible permits did alter the
timing and format of change information, as compared to conventional permitting approaches.
Variability is evident across the six flexible permits with respect to how advance approved changes were
required to be documented and reported.  Most of the flexible permits required some form of notices and/or
summary lists of advance approved changes made to be submitted to the permitting authority, in addition to
maintenance of an on-site log of advance approved changes.  At one end of the range, 3M was required to
submit advance notices and post-construction notices to MPCA for each change implemented using the
advance approval provisions (note:  during the permit term, MPCA eliminated the advance notice requirement,
streamlining relevant information into the post-construction notices).  3M was also required to submit annual
summaries of advance approved changes made during the year.  At the other end of the range, Intel’s permit
did not require the company to report information on specific changes implemented using the advance
approval provisions for a given six-month period if the maximum capacity to emit for the source declined
through P2 or other means during this period, when compared to the previous six-month period.  Saturn’s
permit requires the source to register new advance approved emissions sources with TDEC, although
reporting on specific advance approved changes to existing emissions sources listed in the permit is not

34
34
required.  Under the Intel and Saturn pilot permits, it is likely that less information on certain specific advance
approved changes was available to the permitting authorities, when compared with a conventional permitting
approach, in cases where such changes would have triggered the need for a NSR permit application.  This
assessment assumes that these advance approved changes would have been undertaken by the companies
under a conventional permitting approach.  The permitting authorities indicated that the information available
under the flexible permits was, at a minimum, sufficient to verify compliance with all applicable requirements
and to keep them appropriately informed of source activities.
Permitting authorities generally indicated that some form of recordkeeping and reporting regarding source
implementation of advance approved changes is important.  Inspectors with DNREC and OAPCA reported
that it is helpful to have information on changes made using advance approval provisions during their
inspections, whether this information was reported in advance or maintained in logs at the source.
Under a conventional permitting approach, a company typically submits a notice of construction or other such
permit application to the permitting authority for approval prior to implementing a change that triggers NSR.
These applications typically include specific information on proposed modifications.  In addition, companies
are generally required to submit a notice of completion to the permitting authority once the company has
finished “construction” of the change.  While the same type of change information is typically made available
under a flexible permit, the timing and format of the information differs from that required under a
conventional approach.  First, the advance approval provisions in flexible permits provide some information
at the beginning of the permit term regarding specific changes or categories of changes that are anticipated
during the permit term.  No such advance information is required under conventional permitting approaches.
Second, under flexible permits, companies generally do not submit permit applications for individual changes,
unless the changes are only partially advance approved.  Instead, information on actual changes made that
fit the advance approval descriptions is typically provided to the permitting authority soon after the change
is implemented, typically in the form of a post-construction notice.  In addition, most pilot sources operating
under flexible permits are required to record information on changes made using the advance approval
provisions in an on-site log that is available to agency inspectors.  Third, the flexible permits frequently require
some form of aggregated summary reporting on changes made using the advance approval provisions.  The
companies are typically required to list all advance approved changes made during a particular reporting
period, such as the past month, quarter, or year.  Permitting authorities indicated that the summary reporting
further helps to create an aggregated picture of changes made at the source, when compared with a series
of case-by-case permit applications in the agency file.
The section below discusses more detail regarding the timing, type, format, and accessibility of change
information available under the flexible permits.
•
3M’s permit required the company to provide written notice to MPCA for each change implemented
by the plant that utilized the advance approval provisions in the permit.  A written notice was due to
MPCA ten days prior to beginning actual construction and a subsequent notice was required to
MPCA two weeks after commencing operation.  In May 1996, MPCA representatives reported that
the agency believed that the post-commencement notice for changes was sufficient to provide the
agency and the public with a documented record of advance approved changes actually made at the
source.  3M was also required to submit an annual summary report of advance approved changes
implemented during the past year.
•
Imation is required to submit a notice of completion 30 days after the completion of construction of
advance approved changes.

35
35
•
Lasco’s flexible permit required the company to submit notices of construction completion to
OAPCA for each advance approved change undertaken.  Lasco is also required to maintain an on-
site log of changes implemented under the advance approval provisions.  The permit also requires
Lasco to submit a semi-annual summary of advance approved changes undertaken.
•
DaimlerChrysler is required to submit monthly reports listing changes made using the advance
approval provisions during the prior month.  The NAP is also required to maintain an on-site log of
changes made under these provisions and to submit an annual summary list of advance approved
changes implemented.
•
Saturn is required to register with TDEC new emissions sources constructed under the advance
approval provisions of the permit.  This registration includes the submission of a completed application
form, a brief process description, documentation of BACT or minor source BACT (for sources below
established emissions threshold levels) for the new source, and periodic monitoring parameters for
any control equipment.  The permit also requires Saturn to submit a plan to assess the emissions of
toxic, volatile pollutants from the source within two years of permit issuance.
•
Intel’s permit required the company to submit a list of advance approved changes made during each
six-month period, if there was a net increase in the maximum capacity to emit at the source for that
period, when compared with the maximum capacity to emit for the previous six-month period.  This
occurred once during the five-year permit term.
Several permitting authorities reported that they received more change information from companies operating
under the flexible permits than would have been available under a conventional permitting approach.  These
permitting authorities reported that the flexible permits encouraged sources to report on operational and
equipment changes, even if these changes would not have triggered minor NSR applicability under a
conventional approach.  Since the advance approval provisions removed the need to make case-by-case
determinations of NSR applicability for individual changes implemented during the permit term (companies
only needed to determine whether the changes satisfied the advance approval criteria specified in the permit)
companies tended to report more changes.  For example, 3M indicated that the company viewed the permit
as a valuable asset, and they indicated that they desired to protect this asset by ensuring a high level of
communication with MPCA.  Some permitting authorities indicated that the conventional NSR program may
sometimes create disincentives for companies to report changes for which the applicability of NSR is
uncertain, since such discussions with the permitting authority to determine applicability could prove time
intensive and lengthy.  Permitting authorities indicated that the flexible permits remove any incentive for
companies to “push the interpretation” of applicability determinations in a direction that would result in less
change reporting.
•
MPCA representatives reported that 3M reported information on changes that would not have
triggered minor NSR applicability under a conventional permitting approach, providing MPCA
inspectors and the public with more information on changes implemented at the source.
•
DNREC inspectors indicated that DaimlerChrysler reported information on changes beyond those
that would have been required under a conventional permitting approach.  The inspectors indicated
that this enhanced their understanding of company activities.
During permit implementation, the flexible permits required the provision of more comprehensive and
useful information on plant-wide emissions performance to permitting authorities.
Permitting authorities reported that the plant-wide emissions reporting required under the flexible permits
provides more comprehensive and easy-to-understand information on actual environmental performance

36
36
during the permit term.  In some cases, such as for the DaimlerChrysler and 3M permits, the frequency of
emissions reporting information was also greater than that typically required under a conventional permit.
Even when more frequent emissions reporting was not required, however, the companies were required to
maintain current emissions calculations on-site to demonstrate compliance with the established plant-wide
emissions caps.  The flexible permits all require companies to make these emissions calculations available to
permitting authority inspectors and personnel upon request.  Conventional permitting approaches typically
require preparation of an emissions inventory by the source on an annual basis.
 
•
DaimlerChrysler is required to submit monthly emissions reports to DNREC that include
comprehensive, plant-wide information on VOC and NOx emissions.  The monthly frequency of these
reports is greater than what would typically be available under conventional permits. 
•
The 3M flexible permit required the St. Paul Tape Plant to submit quarterly reports to MPCA on the
source’s plant-wide emissions.  The permit required 3M to report on all plant emissions units,
including those that had been ""grandfathered"" by the Clean Air Act.  These previously
“grandfathered” emissions units were also required to be included in the plant’s emissions monitoring
activities and enforceable compliance limits.  MPCA indicated that daily and annual rolling totals of
VOC emissions provided near ""real time"" information on actual plant-wide emissions.
•
The Intel Title V permit retained Intel’s original PSELs, pollutant-specific, plant-wide short-term and
annual caps on actual emissions.  Intel submitted semi-annual monitoring reports to Oregon DEQ
containing semi-annual compliance certification, emissions statements, and excess emissions upset
log. Since Oregon regulation required PSEL, Oregon DEQ stated that their emissions reporting was
very similar to that required by other Title V facilities in the State.
•
Oklahoma DEQ indicated that Imation’s flexible permit requires annual emissions reporting, similar
to that required under a conventional Title V permit, including annual compliance certification and an
annual emissions inventory.  Oklahoma DEQ indicated that the flexible permit incorporates a
previously “grandfathered” source that would not have been included in compliance reporting under
a conventional permit.
•
Under its flexible PSD permit, Saturn is required to monitor and log monthly plant-wide emissions
data which are maintained on-site and available for TDEC inspection.  Saturn and TDEC indicated
that plant-wide emissions reporting will be required in the forthcoming Title V permit for the source.
During permit implementation, four of the six flexible permits required companies to share information
regarding P2 activities and performance with the permitting authorities.  Conventional permits do not
typically require companies to share P2 information with the permitting authority or public. 
The flexible permits developed for Intel, Imation, and Lasco under EPA’s P4 program each require the
companies to implement P2 programs.  The companies were required to report information on their P2
programs to the permitting authority, in addition to periodic reports on P2 activities, accomplishments, and
performance.  DaimlerChrysler is also required to submit routine reports documenting P2 activities.
•
Imation’s implementation of a P2 program is voluntary, but there is an explicit link in the permit
between adoption of an approved pollution prevention program and the BACT determination for
advance approved changes.  Therefore, to access advance approvals that require BACT, Imation
must have an approved P2 program in place, which Imation did implement during the permit term.
The Lasco permit contained a similar connection between BACT and a P2 program.  The flexible
permit requires Imation to submit an annual P2 executive summary describing the pollution prevention
activities and programs adopted on site, as well as progress against a P2 target of 10 percent per unit

37
37
emissions reduction during the permit term.
•
Intel was required to submit an annual P2 progress report to Oregon DEQ, and a final report at the
end of the permit term.
•
DaimlerChrysler is required to report annually on their P2 activities as part of the annual compliance
certification.
•
Lasco is required to submit an annual P2 progress report, which documents P2 techniques, goals and
accomplishments.  Additionally, prior to the end of the third and fifth year of the permit term, Lasco
is to submit a report demonstrating compliance with the P2 Program.
Finding 7: The flexible permits generally provided to the public equivalent or
greater information than conventional permits.
The EPA’s examination of the public record and the availability of information to the public during the
development and implementation of the flexible permits indicates that the permits shifted the timing, type, and
format of information to the public on emissions performance, operational and equipment changes, and P2
activities.  As discussed in Finding 6 above, the six permits vary in the specific format, timing, and availability
of certain types of information required, particularly related to certain specific advance approved changes
implemented under the permits.  In areas such as plant-wide emissions performance and P2 information, most
of the flexible permits clearly increased the availability of information to the public.  In all six cases, the
permitting authorities indicated that, on balance, the flexible permits improved the availability of information
to the public.
During permit development, the flexible permitting efforts followed or exceeded the permitting
authorities’ conventional communications and public involvement procedures.
Permitting authorities indicated that the availability and flow of information to the pubic during the
development of the flexible permits satisfied or exceeded all requirements associated with the agency's
standard operating procedures for permit development.  This procedure typically includes making the draft
permit available to the public at the permitting authority offices and at a local public library, publishing notice
of the draft permit and public comment opportunities in one or more newspapers, holding a public comment
period (e.g., typically 30 days), and conducting a public hearing if requested by the public.  Some permitting
authorities also publicize draft permits on their website or through other communication mechanisms.
In four of the flexible permit development efforts, including the three permits developed under the EPA’s P4
program, the permitting authorities and companies voluntarily conducted one or more public meetings (i.e.,
in addition to any opportunity to hold a public hearing as part of the formal review process).  While these
meetings were not requested by the public, the permitting authorities and companies believed that the
innovative nature of the permits increased the importance of taking active steps to inform local communities
about the efforts.  In addition, several of the permits experienced local media coverage about the innovative
nature of the permits.
•
At the beginning of the flexible permit development effort in 1996, citizens of Yelm, Washington did
not view Lasco as a “good cooperate neighbor” due to past odor issues.  The subsequent level of
information flow to the public surrounding the Lasco permit development consisted of several
meetings, many public notices, and extensive communication between Lasco and OAPCA.  At the

38
38
end of the permit development process, the Sierra Club submitted a letter supporting Lasco's flexible
permit and thanking EPA Region 10, OAPCA, and Lasco for their proactive efforts to involve the
community in the permit development process.
•
Companies and permitting authorities involved in the development of the Imation, 3M, and Intel
flexible permits each deemed an up-front public meeting in conjunction with the public comment
period to be helpful in communicating to the public about the flexible permits, due to their innovative
nature.  In addition, the companies and permitting authorities were interested to understand early on
any potential public questions or concerns about the permits.  No adverse comments were
subsequently received from the public for any of these permits.
The flexible permit development process increases the availability of information to the interested
public regarding anticipated changes and emissions levels, as compared to a conventional permit
development process.
As discussed in Finding 6 above, the flexible permit development processes provided clear information to the
public regarding the maximum level of source emissions that would be allowed over the permit term, in the
form of established emissions caps.  Permitting authorities indicated that the emissions cap requirements in
the draft permits and communicated during public meetings (when held) provide useful information to
interested members of the public.  If a source desires to exceed its emissions cap, it would thereafter be
required to undergo a major NSR permitting process that would require public comment.  The Lasco example
demonstrates how such up-front information on total allowable plant-wide emissions can increase public
understanding of the permit and anticipated environmental performance.  In accepting the PTE cap of 249
tons/year of VOC emissions, Lasco had to reduce its actual emissions, providing assurances to local residents
that emissions would thereafter be held relatively steady, despite company plans to increase production during
the permit term.  This awareness allayed one of the key concerns voiced by members of the Yelm
community.
During development of the flexible permits, more information was available to interested members of the
public regarding the type of changes the sources anticipated making during the permit term, when compared
to a conventional permit development process.  As discussed in Finding 6, the permitting authorities believed
that the flexible permit development process, through the discussions of advance approved changes, provided
them and interested members of the public with a clear advance understanding of the types of modifications
that the sources planned to make during the permit term.  Under a conventional permitting approach, change
information would typically only be available in a more fragmented, incremental manner, as companies
pursued approval to make changes on a case-by-case basis.  Under the flexible approach, applicable
requirements associated with each advance approved change are identified up-front in the permit, affording
a long-term view of potential applicable requirements, resulting emissions control requirements, and
environmental outcomes.  This enabled the permitting authority and interested members of the public to have
a more comprehensive picture of changes, and associated environmental performance outcomes, that would
likely occur over the permit term.
During permit implementation, the flexible permits varied in the availability of information to the
public about plant-wide emissions, operational and equipment changes, and pollution prevention
activities; all permitting authorities indicated that, on balance, the flexible permits enhanced the
availability of information to the public as compared to information typically available under
conventional permitting approaches.

39
39
During permit implementation, the flexible permits required the provision of more comprehensive and, from
several of the permitting authorities’ perspectives, more useful information on plant-wide emissions
performance to permitting authorities.  As discussed in Finding 6, permitting authorities reported that the plant-
wide emissions reporting required under the flexible permits provides more comprehensive and easy-to-
understand information on actual environmental performance during the permit term.  In some cases, such
as for the DaimlerChrysler and 3M permits, the frequency of emissions reporting information was also greater
than that typically required under a conventional permit.  In other cases, such as for Imation and 3M, the
flexible permits required the companies to report emissions from previously “grandfathered” emissions
sources in their plant-wide emissions reporting.  For all the flexible permits, the reports containing information
on plant-wide emissions were available to the public in the permitting authorities’ files.
The EPA found that there are a variety of techniques for making information available to the public regarding
changes made using the advance approval provisions.  These techniques include advance notices, post-
construction notices, change registration, and periodic summaries of changes made (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
or annual).  For changes that do not meet the advance approval provisions, or that would cause a company
to increase its emissions caps, the company would be required to undergo a conventional permitting process
that would include submission of required application materials and completion of required public notice and
comment procedures.  When combined with the information on anticipated changes identified during the
permit development process, as well as information on plant-wide emissions and P2 activities, the permitting
authorities believe that flexible permits ensure the flow of sufficient information to enable the permitting
authorities to effectively enforce for all applicable requirements, to ensure that air quality is protected in
accordance with their SIPs, and to ensure consistency with the Clean Air Act’s intent to provide for effective
opportunities for public input into air permitting decisions.
As discussed in Finding 6, there was variability in the reporting requirements for changes implemented using
the advance approval provisions.  For four of the flexible permits, including those for 3M, DaimlerChrysler,
Imation, and Lasco, the EPA found that approximately equivalent information on advance approved changes
made was available to the public under the flexible permits, as compared to what permitting authorities
indicated would have been available under conventional permitting approaches.  In these cases, the timing
and format of the advance approved change information was shifted when compared to conventional
permitting approaches.  In general, more general information on advance approved changes was available
up-front during permit development, and more detailed information on specific changes made was available
in the form of notices and lists of changes made, as opposed to minor NSR construction permitting
applications.  In addition, MPCA and DNREC found that the companies reported changes in addition to those
that would likely have triggered minor NSR permit applications under a conventional permitting approach.
For the Intel and Saturn flexible permits, as discussed in Finding 6, more general information on anticipated
changes was available up-front during permit development, but less information on individual changes
implemented using the advance approval provisions was available during permit implementation when
compared to a conventional permitting approach, assuming that these changes would have been made under
a conventional permitting approach.
During permit implementation, four of the flexible permits required companies to report information regarding
P2 activities and performance to the permitting authorities.  This information is available to interested
members of the public through the permitting authority files for these sources.  P2 information would not
typically be available to the public under a conventional permitting approach.
•
The Imation pilot permit required the company to submit annual P2 reports to Oklahoma DEQ
describing the P2 activities and programs adopted at the site, as well as progress against an

40
40
established P2 target.  This information is available to the public in the permitting authority’s files.
•
Intel was required to submit an annual P2 progress report to Oregon DEQ, and a final report at the
end of the permit term.  This information is available to the public in the permitting authority’s files.
•
DaimlerChrysler is required to report annually on their P2 activities.  This information is available to
the public in the permitting authority’s files.
•
Lasco is to submit an annual P2 progress report, which documents P2 techniques, goals, and
accomplishments.  Additionally, prior to the end of the third and fifth year of the permit term, Lasco
is to submit a report demonstrating compliance with the P2 Program.  This information is available
to the public in the permitting authority’s files.
Finding 8: The flexible permits produced or are likely to produce net financial
benefits to companies and permitting authorities.
Companies and permitting authorities reported that the flexible permits have resulted in net financial benefits,
or that they anticipate that this will be the case.  Companies and permitting authorities indicated that initial
permit development costs exceeded those required to develop conventional permits, due to factors related to
the pilot nature of the permits, as well as to factors inherent to developing flexible permitting techniques.  In
each case, however, companies and permitting authorities reported that the flexibility provisions have
decreased, or are expected to decrease, the administrative costs of operating under the permit sufficiently
to more than offset the higher initial permit development costs.
Permit development costs for the flexible permits were significant, but these higher costs were largely
attributed to the pilot nature of the permits.
Companies and permitting authorities involved in the flexible permitting efforts reported that the costs,
primarily resulting from staff time devoted to development of the flexibility provisions, were greater than those
typically experienced in the development of conventional permits.  
•
MPCA representatives estimated that about 1000 hours of MPCA staff time were devoted to
development of the permit.  MPCA representatives noted that a primary factor contributing to the
length of the permit development was that this was the first flexible permit developed in Minnesota,
as well as one of the first developed and issued in the U.S.
•
The development of Lasco’s flexible Title V permit spanned approximately 16 months, from initiation
of discussions (e.g., P4 group discussions) until the permit was issued.  However, in addition to this
being a team-oriented “demonstration” project necessitating additional review and public participation
(see below), this was OAPCA’s first Title V permit.  OAPCA representatives reported that these
factors contributed to the overall length of the permit development process.  In the future, OAPCA
indicated that flexible Title V permits will likely take only slightly more time to develop and issue than
conventional Title V permits (e.g., approximately 180 hours versus 160 hours).
Permitting authorities indicated that a substantial amount of the higher permitting costs were attributable to
the pilot nature of the permits.  These pilot costs stemmed partly from the need for frequent conference calls
or meetings between the permitting authorities, the EPA Regional Offices, and the EPA headquarters to
ensure the flexible permitting techniques would be approved by the EPA in the absence of guidance on
flexible permitting.  Additional costs also resulted from the fact that each of the six flexible permits were the
first developed under these permitting authorities’ jurisdictions, and there was limited national experience with

41
41
specific flexibility provisions from which to draw upon.  Permitting authorities indicated that the pilot-related
transaction costs would likely be reduced significantly or eliminated if the EPA were to issue guidance and/or
rulemaking that clarified the flexible permitting approaches and techniques that are acceptable to the EPA.
Some portion of the higher permit development costs, however, were associated with tailoring of flexible
permitting techniques to address the specific applicable requirements, needs, and circumstances of the
sources.  Permitting authorities and companies indicated that these costs would be incurred in the
development of any new permit containing flexibility provisions, even if the use of flexible permitting
techniques becomes routine and is supported by EPA guidance or rulemaking.  For example, communications
between the companies and permitting authorities regarding the changes that companies’ anticipate making
during the permit term are typically necessary to develop advance approval provisions.  Other flexible
permitting techniques, such as the development of replicable operating and testing procedures and streamlining
of applicable requirements, also entail more significant interactions between a company and permitting
authority during permit development.
•
3M and MPCA reported that additional time was required during permit development to develop the
advance approval descriptions.  This involved discussions to identify the specific changes and
categories of changes that 3M anticipated making during the permit term.
Companies and permitting authorities that have renewed their flexibility provisions in subsequent permits
indicated that the renewal costs have been minimal, as compared to costs required under a conventional
permit renewal process.  While some advance approval provisions may need to be updated at permit renewal,
to accommodate new change needs anticipated by the company over the subsequent permit term, this process
generally requires significantly less company and permitting authority resources than were required for the
initial development of flexibility provisions for the source.  This means that potential financial benefits for
companies and permitting authorities can be extended to subsequent permit terms.
•
Oregon DEQ incorporated many of Intel’s flexibility provisions into the company’s subsequent
synthetic minor air permit without requiring additional permitting authority resources.
•
DNREC reported that it was able to incorporate the flexibility provisions in DaimlerChrysler’s original
pilot flexible permit into the company’s Title V air operating permit without requiring resources
beyond those necessary to issue a conventional Title V permit.
Companies and permitting authorities reported that they experienced financial benefits from
implementation of the flexible permits that more than offset the higher up-front permit development
costs.
Companies and permitting authorities reported that financial benefits arose during permit implementation from
the reduced administrative costs associated with company operational and equipment changes made under
the advance approval provisions.  Companies indicated that the advance approval provisions reduced the staff
time and resources necessary to implement changes covered by these provisions.  Company personnel found
that they did not need to perform detailed applicability determinations for individual changes, provided that the
changes satisfied the advance approval conditions listed in the permit.  Such applicability determinations for
advance approved changes were performed during permit development and clarified in the permit.
Companies indicated that this streamlined applicability determination process and the improved certainty
related to how changes would be addressed under the permit reduced the companies’ staff time needed to
process changes.  Further savings resulted from the companies’ reduced need to prepare applications for

42
42
construction permits and/or permit modifications for individual changes, due to the advance approval
provisions.  Companies indicated that the time necessary to complete permitting authority notifications of
advance approved changes and/or to record such changes in on-site logs was significantly less than the staff
time necessary to prepare permit applications under a conventional permitting approach.
•
DaimlerChrysler representatives estimated that the flexible permits save the company significant staff
time that would have been associated with applicability determinations and permit actions for changes
made using the advance approval provisions.  They estimated that approximately 505 hours of staff
time were saved under the initial flexible permit.  These savings are projected to increase in the
future as the company makes more changes utilizing the advance approval provisions in the permit.
•
Under a conventional permit, Intel would have needed to prepare approximately 150 to 200 notice
of construction applications per year (that were not required under the flexible permit).  Intel
estimated that each application would have required an average of approximately 8 hours, resulting
in 1,200 to 1,600 hours of staff time per year.
•
Lasco estimated that to execute a construction permit requires approximately 50 staff hours.
Additionally, to process a permit modification, Lasco would need to submit a pubic notice (with an
estimated cost of $350) and to hold a public hearing (with an estimated cost of $400).  For all five
changes made using the advance approval provisions, Lasco estimated a cost savings of more than
$20,000.
Permitting authorities also reported that they have experienced, or anticipate experiencing, administrative cost
savings during permit implementation.
•
MPCA representatives indicated that they view flexible permits as saving agency resources by
reducing the number of case-by-case change reviews and permitting actions.  MPCA estimated that
each of their minor NSR permit actions (if straightforward) require an average level of effort
equivalent to approximately $1,000, and 3M estimated that approximately 15 to 20 of the 34 changes
undertaken likely would have required a minor permitting action.  From MPCA’s standpoint then, the
flexible permit provided an administrative savings benefit of between $15,000 and $20,000.  Further,
3M indicated at least two of their changes may have been major permit actions requiring
approximately 100 hours of processing by MPCA.  At $125 per hour, this would represent an
additional savings to MPCA of $25,000.
•
Oklahoma DEQ representatives stated that the Imation permit has saved time for DEQ personnel,
enabling them to “operate more effectively” with their limited staff.  They indicated that most of the
time savings result from the reduced need for administrative processing of case-by-case construction
permitting actions and air toxics approvals.  DEQ representatives stated that they have identified at
least five changes made under the advance approval provisions that would have required a permitting
action under a conventional permitting approach, but that only required written notices under the
flexible Title V permit.  They indicated that, minus the flexibility provisions, each of these permitting
actions would have required a 45-day review and approval process that could have extended well
beyond that in some cases.  They further indicated that this resource savings enables DEQ to focus
scarce resources on inspections and other environmental and permitting priorities.
•
The Intel permit saved Oregon DEQ significant staff time associated with processing notice of
construction applications from Intel.  Intel estimated that in the absence of the flexible permit, Oregon
DEQ would have needed to process approximately 150 to 200 additional notice of construction
applications per year.  Even at a very low estimate of two staff hours per application, the staff time
implications are significant (e.g., 300 to 400 hours).

•
During the flexible permit term, Lasco made five advance approved changes that would have
otherwise triggered case-by-case minor NSR permit actions.  OAPCA estimated that Lasco’s
flexible permit saved them approximately 20 to 40 staff hours per advance approved change. The
time savings includes time spent drafting a permit to construct, ensuring NAAQS compliance,
modifying the Title V permit, and conducting the change-specific public review process. At $75/hour,
the estimated administrative costs saved by the flexible permit for all five advance approved
conditions ranges from $7,500 to $15,000.
•
TDEC reported that the Saturn flexible permit has reduced agency paperwork associated with
processing individual construction permit applications and permit modifications, allowing agency staff
to focus on higher environmental priorities.  They further indicated that the permit saved TDEC
significant staff time associated with processing notice of construction applications from Saturn.  The
permit eliminates the need for full minor NSR permitting.  Traditionally, permitting for minor NSR
takes approximately 24 to 40 staff hours, plus issuance of a public notice and a town meeting or
public hearing.  This process has been streamlined to a State control technology review for new unit
additions not subject to major BACT.  TDEC representatives believe that during the life of the permit,
TDEC will need to invest less hours of staff time to address the future air permitting needs associated
with the Saturn plant, due to the anticipated future use of the advance approval provisions. 
It should be noted that companies and permitting authorities cautioned that it is difficult to precisely estimate
cost savings and financial benefits associated with flexible permit implementation, since it involves comparison
with hypothetical experience under a conventional permitting approach.  Companies and permitting authorities
noted that the flexible permit provisions sufficiently altered the applicability determination for individual
changes so as to make it difficult to retrospectively determine the precise level of effort and timing that would
have been necessary to accommodate the changes under a conventional permitting approach.  That said,
companies and permitting authorities indicated that the estimated financial benefits identified in this report
provide a reasonable approximation of the financial benefits that resulted from implementation of the flexible
permits, compared to those costs that would likely have been expected had the companies been operating
under conventional permits.
In additional to administrative cost savings, several companies identified financial benefits stemming from the
ability to implement advance approved changes without the potential delay associated with conventional
permitting time frames.  Several companies indicated that this streamlined ability to implement advance
approved changes improved the predictability of change implementation time frames for project planning and
avoided what can be substantial opportunity costs.  They further reported that this predictability and
elimination of potential delay from air permitting provided important competitive advantages that enabled them
to compete more effectively.
•
From 3M’s perspective, the flexible permit allowed the company to proceed as needed with
operational change.  This was critical from two perspectives:  it allowed the plant to avoid acting as
a bottleneck along the critical path of any particular product line that would be moving among 3M
plants; and it allowed the plant to remain highly responsive to its marketplace and avoid either lost
sales and/or permanent loss of market share.  3M did indicate that the changes made that potentially
involved PSD permitting likely would not have been undertaken if handled on a conventional basis.
•
DaimlerChrysler representatives indicated that the permit has increased the company’s ability to
respond to short-term changes in market demand, as well as to accommodate the tight project time
lines associated with periodic model changeovers.  DNREC and DaimlerChrysler representatives
reported that under a conventional permitting approach, some of these changes would likely have
triggered case-by-case applicability determinations and potential permitting actions that could have

extended to 6 to 9 months each.
•
The advance approved changes in Intel’s flexible permit likely saved the Intel Aloha plant hundreds
of business days associated with making operational and process changes to ramp up production for
new products, respond to market demands, and optimize production processes.  Industry estimates
of the opportunity costs of production downtime and time delays run as high as several million dollars
in just a few days due to lost sales to computer makers and other factors.  The estimated 150 to 200
changes per year5, combined with the Oregon DEQ approval time frame of up to 60 days per
change6, indicate that there would likely have been significant delay under a conventional permitting
approach.  Even if few delays would have resulted in production downtime or missed market
opportunities, the costs would likely have been significant, as many of the changes improved the cost-
competitiveness of Intel’s products.  Intel representatives indicated that it is likely that the impact of
continued time delays would be to redirect Intel’s production investment and operating facilities to
locations more conducive to change.
•
Imation representatives reported that the flexibility provisions in the Title V permit enabled the
company to experiment with new materials and to introduce the production of new products at the
Weatherford plant with minimal delay associated with air permitting and material toxicity
assessments.  Under the flexibility provisions, Imation is authorized to use alternative raw materials
without receiving case-by-case approval or permit modifications that typically can take  two to three
months, provided that they follow established procedures and ensure emissions remain below
specified limits.  Even for materials for which Oklahoma had not previously reviewed, DEQ agreed
to complete toxicity evaluations and establish MAAC limits within 72 hours of receiving a request
from Imation.  Imation representatives stated that these streamlined administrative procedures for
addressing Oklahoma’s air toxics requirements have eliminated air permitting delay associated with
raw material changes.  Among other product transitions, the flexibility provisions in the Title V permit
have facilitated Imation’s development of digital proofing films for graphic design applications.  In
addition to various product quality benefits, digital proofing films also require fewer coating layers
during manufacturing than conventional proofing films.  This results in fewer VOC emissions from
solvents per unit.  While customer demand for digital proofing materials is increasing, it is likely to
take several years before digital proofing technology is in widespread use, due to the cost of
converting to digital proofing hardware.
•
Lasco engaged in a series of advance approved changes, updated its emission factor, and voluntarily
installed an RTO.  These actions combined to create “head room” under Lasco’s cap, which Lasco
then used to increase production.  Lasco indicated that typically (and as reflected by the Yelm plant’s
lack of operational change prior to the flexible permit and experience at other Lasco facilities) the
company is very averse to making changes that trigger permitting actions.  At most, they wait to
undertake such changes at the time of permit renewal. Contrary to its typical corporate behavior,
Lasco Yelm engaged in a series of modifications that created  the opportunity to increase production
from 126,045 units/year (in 1997) to 132,548 units/year (in 2000) generating a significant annual
increase in profit.  In 2001, after the RTO was installed, Lasco decreased emissions per unit further
to 3.13 lbs./unit, allowing production to increase to 147,429 units and reducing costs associated with

45
45
styrene loss.
•
Saturn indicated that the flexible permit was a principle factor in General Motors’ selection of the
source to manufacture the L850 engine, leading to the creation of 700 jobs.  Saturn was awarded the
contract primarily because it could implement the necessary changes within 24 months and
accommodate future changes with minimal delay.  The flexible PSD permit is enabling Saturn to add
and modify coating, assembly and machining lines in a timely manner, while ensuring that best
available pollution control technologies are installed and that air emissions remain under approved
limits. Using a combination of the PAL emissions caps and advanced approvals, the flexible permit
will allow Saturn to upgrade the plant over the next few years, with minimal delays, to produce
several new vehicles, including Saturn’s new fuel-efficient sport utility vehicle, the Saturn VUE™.
Saturn representatives stated that the flexible permit avoids a potential NSR backlog associated with
the conventional permitting process, thereby providing a competitive advantage to Saturn.
Finding 9:  Permitting authorities are generally supportive of flexible permits
as an option.
The permitting authorities reported that they are pleased with the benefits from the flexible permits.
Additionally, they believe flexible permitting techniques are useful tools to address some companies’
operational flexibility needs, to foster environmental improvements through emissions reductions, and to lessen
permitting authority resource needs and backlogs associated with construction permitting, so that these public
agencies can focus resources on higher environmental management priorities.  Finding 10 discusses permitting
authority perspectives on matching flexibility provisions with appropriate source candidates. 
Permitting authorities are supportive of flexible permits, and they expressed their interest to renew the
pilot flexible permits and to expand the use of flexible permits in their jurisdictions.
Permitting authorities demonstrated their support of flexible permits by retaining the flexibility provisions in
the subsequent permit for the source, or by indicating their interest to do so.
•
Oregon DEQ retained the advance approval provisions in Intel’s synthetic minor air operating permit
that replaced the Aloha plant’s Title V permit in 1999.
•
MPCA indicated that the agency is supportive of renewing 3M’s flexibility provisions in the
forthcoming Title V permit.  In discussing options for the plant’s Title V permitting application (under
consideration by MPCA at the time of the EPA review), however, 3M management decided not to
pursue such provisions due to uncertainty surrounding how the next VOC emissions limit would be
defined.  3M voiced concerns that significantly lowered emissions caps could constrain the plant’s
ability to accommodate increased product demand or transfers of product lines from other 3M
facilities.
•
DNREC supported the renewal of all flexibility provisions from DaimlerChrysler’s initial flexible
construction and air operating permit into the plant’s Title V permit, issued in October 1999.
Two permitting authorities further demonstrated their support of flexibility provisions by incorporating
flexibility techniques into permits for other sources within their jurisdiction.
•
MPCA reported that the agency has issued “dozens” of minor source and synthetic minor source

46
46
permits that include flexibility provisions (e.g., plant-wide emissions caps and advance approval
provisions) since the issuance of the 3M St. Paul Tape Plant pilot permit in 1993.  MPCA also issued
a permit to 3M’s Maplewood, Minnesota research and development plant that included an advance
approved BACT determination.
•
DNREC has issued a Title V permit for DuPont’s Edge Moor, Delaware plant that includes PALs
and advance approval provisions, as well as several permits containing alternate operating scenarios.
Permitting authorities indicated that finalization of EPA policy and/or guidance on flexible permitting
would increase their interest and efficiency in expanding the use of flexible permits.
Permitting authorities indicated that finalization of rulemaking and/or guidance related to flexible permitting
is desired to provide greater clarity and certainty around the EPA’s expectations.  Most permitting authorities
stated that, while they are supportive of flexible permitting approaches, they are somewhat hesitant to invest
resources of any significant amount into new flexible permits in the absence of increased clarity regarding
approaches that are acceptable to the EPA.  Permitting authorities generally did not want to find themselves
in a position where they have developed numerous flexible permits based on an approach or regulatory
interpretation that does not correlate with the EPA’s approved flexible permitting rules and/or guidance
developed at some point in the future.
Several permitting authorities also noted the high transaction costs associated with developing “pilot” permits
as an additional deterrent to expanding the use of flexibility techniques without EPA policy or guidance.  Pilot
initiatives typically demand a high level of interaction between the permitting authority, EPA Regional Offices,
and various offices within the EPA headquarters to verify that the pilot approaches are acceptable.
Permitting authorities indicated that EPA policy and/or guidance could reduce the amount of time spent in
conference calls and meetings, and in the development of flexible permit language that does not meet the
EPA’s expectations, while also reducing the overall time frame for developing a flexible permit.  One
permitting authority believed that additional guidance was not needed for it to act but agreed with the other
permitting authorities that EPA rules and/or guidance on flexible permitting might serve to improve the
consistency of regulatory interpretations, expectations, and comments communicated by various EPA offices
and regions.
While permitting authorities supported promulgation of EPA policy and/or guidance on flexible permitting, they
hoped that any such policy would be accommodative of the approaches employed in the pilot flexible permits.
In addition, DNREC representatives urged the EPA to not be overly prescriptive in any policy or guidance
and to allow permitting authorities reasonable discretion in the implementation of approved flexibility
techniques.
Permitting authorities stated that various forms of EPA outreach, training, and assistance would be
useful to assist permitting authorities to develop effective flexible permits.
Permitting authorities and companies emphasized that the EPA could take several steps, in addition to
promulgation of flexible permitting policy and/or guidance, to support the implementation of effective flexible
permits.  Suggestions included:
•
Make documentation available regarding flexible permitting techniques.  Materials should include
examples of flexible permits, fact sheets on various flexible permitting approaches and tools, draft
permit language related to various flexibility approaches, training materials, and other resources.
•
Formalize a network of EPA flexible permitting experts who would be available to support permitting
authorities interested to develop permits containing flexibility provisions.

47
47
•
Conduct workshops and training sessions for EPA and permitting authority personnel who are
interested to learn about flexible permitting techniques.  Similar workshops or training sessions could
be designed for sources to help them determine whether or not they may be appropriate candidates
for flexible permitting techniques.
•
Develop a tool to assist sources and permitting authorities to determine the appropriateness of flexible
permitting techniques to potential source candidates.
•
Develop an EPA website clearinghouse for information on flexible permitting techniques.
Finding 10:  Permitting authorities indicated that flexible permit provisions
should be matched with a company’s need for flexibility and technical capacity
to implement effectively its flexible permit requirements.
Permitting authorities indicated that while they believe flexible permitting techniques to be appropriate and
beneficial for use with some companies, they may not be appropriate for all companies.  They indicated that
there are two critical factors that should be considered when determining the appropriateness of flexible
permitting  for candidate sources.  First, the company should be able to demonstrate that it has a need for the
flexibility.  Second, the permitting authority should be confident that the source has sufficient capacity to
operate effectively under a flexible permit, which typically includes additional monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting requirements.
Permitting authorities believe that a candidate company should be able to demonstrate sufficient need
for flexibility to justify the additional up-front staff time and resources needed for the permitting
authority to tailor flexible permitting techniques to the source.
Permitting authorities indicated that they want to have some assurance that any additional up-front investment
will result in benefits for the company, permitting authority, and/or environment before investing in the
development of a flexible permit.  Such need could be demonstrated by a company’s ability to clearly
articulate its operational change needs.  Permitting authorities indicated that some companies seldom
implement changes that trigger air permitting requirements, making them less appropriate candidates for
flexible permits.
Permitting authorities indicated that a candidate company should exhibit the technical capacity to
operate effectively under a flexible permit, as indicated by factors such as the source’s compliance
history, attentiveness to pollution prevention, and ability to track and manage operational changes and
emissions.
Permitting authorities indicated that while they believe company compliance with flexible permits to be fully
verifiable and enforceable, they believe that companies lacking sufficient capacity to operate effectively under
a flexible permit could be at an increased risk of non-compliance.  Additional monitoring, reporting, and
recordkeeping conditions, such as the calculation of plant-wide emissions and maintenance of logs
documenting operational changes and alternate operating scenarios, are typically required to assure
compliance with flexible permit provisions.  Permitting authorities indicated that some companies may not
have sufficient capacity and capabilities to effectively meet such permit requirements on a sustained basis.
Permitting authorities stated that they view a company’s past compliance history as the primary indicator of
the company’s capacity to operate under a flexible permit.  Past patterns of compliance violations often signal
that a company is not sufficiently able to handle additional monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting

48
48
requirements necessary under a flexible permit.  Permitting authorities pointed to several other indicators of
a company’s capacity to operate effectively and in compliance under a flexible permit.  These include:
•
A company’s capacity to track and manage operational and equipment changes.
•
A company’s ability to accurately monitor plant-wide emissions.
•
A company’s track record of communication and openness with the permitting authority.
•
The presence of trained personnel at the source who understand air requirements.
•
The presence of a P2 program and/or a track record of P2 accomplishment.
Permitting authorities indicated, however, that rigid criteria for determining the appropriateness of flexible
permitting techniques for a company candidate, such as the complete absence of historic compliance
violations, should not be established.  They indicated that permitting authority personnel are accustomed to
matching appropriate permitting techniques and requirements to address individual sources’ applicable
requirements and circumstances.

7The permit expires on December 31, 2005, but the plant-wide applicability limits (PALs) extend to July 2010.

The BCCA Appeal Group (the “Group”) submits the following comments in 
response to the proposed disapproval of Texas's state implementation plan (“SIP”) revisions 
relating to Qualified Facilities and general definitions by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (“EPA”), published in the Federal Register on September 23, 2009.  The Group is 
comprised of members with the common interests of achieving the goals of clean air and a strong 
economy for Texas.  The Group is comprised of the following members:  Air Products, L.P.; 
Celanese Chemicals, Ltd.; Conoco Phillips; The Dow Chemical Company; Entergy Texas, Inc.; 
Exxon Mobil Corporation; Lyondell Chemical Company; Texas Petrochemicals, L.P.; Valero 
Refining-Texas, L.P.
I.
Introduction
The Group strongly supports full approval of the Qualified Facility provisions and 
definitions.  The Texas air quality permitting program, including the Qualified Facility 
provisions, is stringent, comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.  
Under Texas’s integrated air permitting regime, air quality in the state is 
demonstrating strong, sustained improvement.  Between 1999 and 2005, NOX emissions in the 
Houston-Galveston area decreased from almost 1,200 tons per day, to under 600 tons per day.1  
Ozone as measured under the one-hour standard in the Houston-Galveston area has declined 
from 220 parts per billion (“ppb”) in 1991 to 127 ppb in 2009.2  Under the eight-hour standard, 
ozone in the Houston-Galveston area has declined from 119 ppb in 1991, to 84 ppb in 2009.3  .4  
Moreover, between 1988 and 2008, there has been an 80% reduction in VOC compound 
indicators in the Houston area.5  There has been a similar improvement in toxic air emissions.  
Between 2003 and 2008, there has been a 50% decrease in highly reactive volatile organic 
compounds (“HRVOCs”) in the Houston area.6  Similarly, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, ozone 
as measured under the one-hour standard declined from 140 ppb in 1991 to 115 ppb in 2009.7  
Ozone for the Dallas-Fort Worth area under the eight-hour standard has declined from 105 ppb

in 1991 to 86 ppb in 2009  Notably, according to recent TCEQ review, all areas of Texas are in 
attainment for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.8
Further, the data show that stationary sources have contributed more substantial 
emissions reductions than any other category during the period of most dramatic air quality 
improvements.  In the Houston-Galveston area between 1993 and 2008, NOX emissions from 
stationary sources declined from 695 tons per day (“tpd”), to 156 tpd, a decrease of 539 tpd.9  
During that same period, emissions from on-road source declined from 416 tpd to 175 tpd, a 
decrease of 241 tpd.10  Similarly, stationary sources made significant decreases for VOC.  
Between 1993 and 2009 in the Houston-Galveston area, VOC emissions from stationary sources 
decreased from 411 tpd, to 170 tpd, a decrease of 241 tpd.11  On-road sources from that same 
period decreased from 199 tpd, to 86 tpd, a decrease of 113 tpd.12  As the figures indicate, 
stationary sources in Texas have made the most significant strides in reducing emissions.
The submitted revisions strengthen a previously SIP-approved Texas program. 
Under the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “Act”), SIP revisions are approved when those 
revisions do not interfere with the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(“NAAQS”).  States have the primary responsibility for developing plans for the attainment and 
maintenance of the NAAQS.  In fact, as the Fifth Circuit recently explained:
Although EPA is required to approve SIPs that provide for the timely 
attainment and subsequent maintenance of primary and secondary ambient 
air standards as well as satisfy other CAA general requirements, see 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(a)(3), the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a 
State’s choices of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that 
otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(2).13
Rather, the proper test for determining whether a SIP revision can be approved is whether the 
revision interferes with attainment of the NAAQS (i.e. that the plan does not make air quality 
worse).14  The last ten years have seen an unprecedented improvement in Texas air quality.  The 
submitted revisions have been fully integrated components of the Texas air quality permitting 
program for all that time.  Because the current SIP submittals function to strengthen the existing 
SIP, such submittal does not raise interference concerns, and should be fully approved.

A.
Overview
The Texas Qualified Facility program is a minor New Source Review (“minor 
NSR”) applicability trigger.  Under the program, existing emissions units (defined in the Texas 
rules as “existing facilities”) that employ up-to-date best available control technology (“BACT”) 
may make physical and operational changes without a minor NSR review, so long as the changes 
do not result in net emissions increases above their current, protective limits.15  
The Qualified Facilities program is statutory.  All of its key provisions are laid out 
in the Texas Clean Air Act.16
The program applies to “existing facilities.”  A “facility” is defined as “[a] 
discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure that constitutes or 
contains a stationary source, including appurtenances other than emission control equipment.”17   
Notably, the definition of “facility” here is similar to the federal definition of “emissions unit,” 
used in Texas’s Title V program.18  
Qualified facilities may make physical or operational changes so long as the 
change does not result in a net increase in allowable emission of any air contaminant or the 
emission of any new air contaminant.  Changes that meet this criterion are not considered 
“modifications” subject to minor NSR review by TCEQ.19  
The program only reaches changes to an existing facility.20  Thus, the program 
does not authorize the construction of new facilities.
The Texas Legislature established the Qualified Facility program in order to 
provide additional incentives for sites to employ up-to-date (i.e., no more than 10-year-old) 
BACT.  Accordingly, a facility may remain a Qualified Facility only so long as it (1) was issued 
a permit or permit amendment or was exempted from pre-construction permit requirements no 
earlier than 120 months before the change will occur, or (2) uses air pollution control methods 
that are at least as effective as the BACT that was required or would have been required for the 
same class or type of facility by a permit issued 120 months before the change will occur.21  
Status as a qualified facility is not perpetual.  A facility may lose its status as a 
qualified facility if its permit, exemption or control method falls outside the 10-year window.  
“For example, if a facility obtained a permit on January 15, 1991, it would be a qualified facility 
on the basis of the permit until January 14, 2001, and would be eligible to have changes made 
under the qualified facility flexibility.   After that date, the facility is no longer eligible to have

changes made under the qualified facility flexibility unless the status as a qualified facility is 
continued or regained by a subsequent permit action or appropriate control methods.”22  
B.
The Qualified Facility Program Safeguards Major NSR
TCEQ rules ensure that the Qualified Facility flexibility is not to be used to 
circumvent federal NSR.  Section 116.117(a)(4) requires that an owner or operator wishing to 
use the program must document: 
[S]ufficient information as necessary to show that the project will comply with 
§116.150 and §116.151 of this title (relating to Nonattainment Review) and §§ 
116.160-116.163 of this title (relating to Prevention of Significant Deterioration 
Review) . . . .23
Additionally, §116.117(d) states that “[n]othing in this section shall limit the applicability of any 
federal requirements.”24  To ensure that the regulated community understands the federal NSR 
safeguards, the associated TCEQ guidance document states:
SB 1126 only revised the Texas “minor new source review” program to allow 
some changes to be made without a requirement to obtain a permit or other 
“approval” from the [TCEQ].  SB 1126 does not supersede federal requirements 
such as Nonattainment (NA) review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration 
(PSD) review of new major sources and major modifications to existing sources, 
which are incorporated into Chapter 116.  . . .  In making changes under SB 1126, 
owners and operators must consider the potential for these other federal and sate 
requirements to limit their ability to make a desired change.  The owner/operator 
is responsible for ensuring that any change to a facility complies with all 
applicable regulations.25
TCEQ guidance also specifically states that the program does not supersede other state 
regulations on emissions or TCEQ’s powers and duties to take action to control air pollution.
TCEQ guidance also addresses the interplay of changes under the Qualified 
Facility program and special conditions in the permits a facility holds.  “If a change made under 
the qualified facility flexibility would result in the violation of a permit special condition, the 
permit holder must revise the permit special conditions to stay in compliance with the permit,”26
through either the permit alteration process of 30 TAC §116.116(c) or the notification process of 
30 TAC § 116.117(d).  As explained above, 30 TAC § 116.117(d) states that “[n]othing in this 
section shall limit the applicability of any federal requirements.”  Thus, any changes to a facility 
must comply with federal NSR and PSD rules.

The Qualified Facility Program Exceeds Federal Benchmarks for 
Allowables-Based Minor NSR Triggers
As outlined above, the Qualified Facility program is a minor NSR applicability 
trigger.  As such, the program is one of the flexibility mechanisms encouraged by EPA in its 
2009 Flexible Air Permitting Rule.27  In reflecting on its decade-long flexible permit pilot 
program, EPA observed:
Upon examining the provisions of their minor NSR programs, most of the 
States in which pilot permits were conducted . . .  found that they could 
issue advance approvals under existing minor NSR authority for a wide 
spectrum of changes, provided that certain boundary conditions were 
established in the minor NSR permit.28
The Texas Qualified Facility program functions in a similar manner.  However, by requiring up-
to-date BACT as a requirement to use the flexibility, the Texas program is more stringent than 
the federal model.  
Similarly, the Qualified Facility program is comparable to the proposed 
allowables-based minor NSR trigger in EPA’s 2006 proposed Indian Country Rule.  EPA 
proposed the Indian Country rule based on a composite of state minor NSR programs, in order to 
create a level playing field with the states.  “[W]e seek to establish a flexible preconstruction 
permitting program for minor stationary sources in Indian [C]ountry that is comparable to that 
which applies outside of Indian [C]ountry . . . .”29  As such, the rule represents a clear indication 
of the scope of statutory flexibility in crafting minor NSR tools.  “[T]his proposal . . .  represents 
how we would implement the program in Indian [C]ountry in the absence of an EPA-approved 
implementation plan.  However, if a tribe is developing its own program, this can serve as one 
example of a program that meets the objectives and requirements of the Act.”30
EPA set an allowables trigger for minor NSR in its Indian Country rule.  Under 
EPA’s rule, “a modification is defined . . . as any physical or operational change at a stationary 
source that would cause an increase in the allowable emissions of the affected emissions unit.”31  
In justifying the allowables-based minor NSR trigger in this rule, EPA distinguished the 
definition of “modification” under minor NSR from that used for major NSR:  
In a recent decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that, based 
on the wording of the definition of “modification” in section 111(a)(4) of 
the Act, the applicability of major NSR to modifications must be based on 
changes in actual emissions (State of New York, et., v. U.S. EPA, June 24, 
2005).  However, because the statutory basis for the minor NSR program

is section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act, which does not define or refer to a 
definition of “modification,” we believe that we have discretion in 
defining the term as we think best for the minor NSR program in Indian 
Country . . . .32   
In the same fashion, Texas’s Qualified Facility program uses allowables as its minor NSR 
“modification” trigger.  Again, however, the Texas program is more stringent, as it only extends 
the flexibility to well-controlled facilities.  
III.
Group Comments on EPA’s Specific Asserted Deficiencies for the Qualified Facility 
Program
EPA’s concerns on specific aspects of the Texas Qualified Facilities program and 
air permitting definitions are reproduced and addressed below.  Headings are for convenience 
only—all comments are intended to address all aspects of EPA’s proposal.
A.
The Definition of Facility
EPA Comment:

“It is our understanding of State law, that a ‘facility’ can be an 
“emissions unit,” i.e., any part of a stationary source that emits or 
may have the potential to emit any air contaminant.  A ‘facility’ 
also can be a piece of equipment, which is smaller than an 
‘emissions unit.’  A ‘facility’ can be a ‘major stationary source’ as 
defined by Federal law.  A ‘facility’ under State law can be more 
than one ‘major stationary source.’”
Group Response:
For purposes of the Qualified Facility program, TCEQ regulations make clear that 
“facility” is comparable to the federal definition of an “emissions unit.”  Section 116.10(6)  
defines a facility as: 
A discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure 
that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.  A mine, quarry, well test, or road 
is not a facility.33
Section 116.10 clearly states that the definitions contained in the section apply to all provisions 
contained in the Chapter.34  Thus, the facility definition of §116.10(10)(6) expressly applies to 
Qualified Facility rules contained in Chapter 116.

meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.”)

HOU2:1184196.7

This definition is similar to the definition of “emission unit” in Texas’s Title V 
rules.  There, “emissions unit” is defined as:
A discrete or identifiable structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure 
that constitutes or contains a stationary source, including appurtenances 
other than emission control equipment.35
Under the express terms of § 116.10, the definition of “facility” is clear, and 
applies directly to the Qualified Facility rules.
B.
Major NSR Safeguards
1.
The program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR, thereby 
allowing new major stationary sources to construct without a 
Major NSR permit.
EPA Comments:

“Both the SIP-codified Chapter 106, Subchapter A for Permits by 
Rule and the SIP-codified Chapter 116, Subchapter F for Standard 
Permits, contain clear regulatory applicability requirements 
limiting their use to Minor NSR, clear regulatory requirements 
prohibiting their use for any project that constitutes a major 
modification subject to Major NSR, and clear regulatory 
provisions prohibiting the use of these Minor NSR permits from 
circumventing Major NSR. There are no similar regulatory 
applicability requirements, regulatory provisions prohibiting the 
use for Major NSR, and no regulatory provisions prohibiting 
circumvention of Major NSR, in the submitted Qualified Facilities 
State Program’s rules and definitions.”
Group Response:
As outlined above, the Qualified Facility program establishes an allowables-based 
trigger for minor NSR.  The Qualified Facility program has no effect on a permit holder’s 
compliance obligations under the federal PSD or NNSR programs.  
The CAA does not mandate a methodology for determining minor NSR 
applicability. 

Federal regulations that govern minor NSR programs at 40 CFR §§ 51.160-.164 
do not mandate a methodology for determining minor NSR applicability.

In 2000, the U.S. EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) confirmed that 
there is no “legally prescribed methodology” for the emissions test used for minor

NSR applicability determinations, and rejected the argument made by EPA 
enforcement personnel that, in the absence of an explicit minor NSR methodology 
in State rules, the minor NSR applicability test must be consistent with that used 
for federal PSD purposes.36  

EPA’s own August 2006 proposal for minor NSR programs in Indian Country 
employs an “allowable-to-allowable” test to determine if a modification subject to 
minor NSR requirements has occurred.37
States have great flexibility under the CAA in determining the applicability of 
minor NSR requirements, and that flexibility includes the authority to use allowable emission 
rates in establishing whether minor NSR is triggered.  
TCEQ rules articulate an overriding obligation to comply with federal NSR 
requirements.  Section 116.117(a)(4) requires that an owner or operator wishing to use the 
Qualified Facility program to make a change must document 
[S]ufficient information as necessary to show that the project will comply 
with §116.150 and §116.151 of this title (relating to Nonattainment 
Review) and §§ 116.160-116.163 of this title (relating to Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration Review) . . .38
Additionally, §116.117(d) states that “[n]othing in this section shall limit the applicability of any 
federal requirements.”39  The current Qualified Facility rules, therefore, constrain the regulated 
community from making major changes without complying with major NSR requirements.  
2.
The program does not require that first an applicability 
determination 
be 
made 
whether 
the 
construction 
or 
modification is subject to Major NSR.
EPA Comment:

“We do not find any provisions in the submitted Program that 
require a Major NSR applicability determination for changes. The 
submitted Program’s rules and definitions are not clear on their 
face that first one must determine the threshold question of 
whether the change is a major stationary source or a major 
modification subject to Major NSR.”

The Group reiterates its comments from Section III.B.1 above.  The overriding 
obligation to comply with federal NSR requirements is made explicit in TCEQ’s rules.  The 
current regulations constrain the regulated community from making major changes without 
complying with major NSR requirements.  The clear provisions in the Texas rules safeguarding 
federal NSR are supported by well-developed TCEQ guidance.40  Neither EPA’s Indian Country 
rule, nor any of several recently SIP-approved state minor NSR rules, contain explicit language 
calling for a major NSR applicability determination before use of the minor NSR tools.41  
Accordingly, there are no federal requirements, nor any federally-approved analogues, for the 
provisions that EPA is now suggesting should exist.  To the contrary, EPA’s own Indian Country 
preamble, quoted above, notes the absence of such benchmarks.  Requiring additional language 
in Texas would be arbitrary, and would contravene the principle articulated by the Fifth Circuit 
that, 
Although EPA is required to approve SIPs that provide for the timely 
attainment and subsequent maintenance of primary and secondary ambient 
air standards as well as satisfy other CAA general requirements, see 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(a)(3), the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a 
State’s choices of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that 
otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(2).42
3.
The program does not include the requirement to make Major 
NSR applicability determinations based on actual emissions 
and on emissions increases and decreases (netting) that occur 
within a major stationary source.
EPA Comment:

“[T]his submitted Program allows an evaluation using allowable, 
not actual emissions as the baseline to calculate the project’s 
proposed emission increase and for many of the netting emission 
reduction, thereby in many case possibly circumventing the major 
modification applicably requirements under the Major NSR rules, 
rules that are based upon using actual emissions to calculate 
baseline emissions.”

Group Response:
The Group reiterates its comments from Section III.B.1 above.  The overriding 
obligation to comply with federal NSR requirements is made explicit in TCEQ’s rules.  
Moreover, states have great flexibility under the CAA in determining the applicability of minor 
NSR requirements, and that flexibility includes the authority to use allowable emission rates in 
establishing whether minor NSR is triggered.  
C.
Minor NSR Approval Issues
1.
The program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR thereby 
allowing major modification to occur without a Major NSR 
permit.
EPA Comment:

 “There are no statutory and/or regulatory provisions that clearly 
prohibit the use of the Program for major modifications. Nor are 
there any statutory and/or regulatory provisions clearly limiting 
the use of the Program to minor modifications.”
Group Response:
The Group reiterates its comments from Section III.B.1 above.  The overriding 
obligation to comply with federal NSR requirements is made explicit in the statute, TCEQ’s 
rules, and guidance on the program.  The current regulations and guidance, therefore, constrain 
the regulated community from making major changes without complying with major NSR 
requirements.
2.
The program in not an enforceable Minor NSR Permitting 
program.
EPA Comments:

“The Program is not clear that each Qualified Facility involved in 
the netting transaction must submit a permit application and 
obtain a permit revision reflecting all of the changes made to 
reduce emissions (relied upon in the netting analysis) as well as 
reflecting the change itself that increased emissions.”  

“At a minimum, the State must revise its rules to make it clear that 
a permit application must be submitted by each participating 
Qualified Facility and the changes made by the participating 
Qualified Facilities are reflected in revised permits issued by the 
TCEQ.”
Group Response:

HOU2:1184196.7

As explained above, the Qualified Facility program is a minor NSR triggering 
provision.  Instead of a permit review, a facility must give TCEQ notification of any changes 
made using the program rules and must document the changes and retain that documentation at 
the plant site.
TCEQ guidance makes clear that the facilities involved in a change must be 
qualified facilities at the time the change is to occur.  Any facility that is not a qualified facility at 
the time of the change cannot be involved in the netting analyses.43
In two situations, a facility must qualify with TCEQ prior to making a change, but 
this is not a permitting procedure.  Rather a facility must be qualified by TCEQ when:
(1) The facility is qualified on the basis of BACT, but the specific control method 
has not yet been approved by TCEQ as qualifying BACT, or 
(2) The facility does not have established allowable emissions for an air 
contaminant relevant to the change in a MAERT or Form PI-E document.44
In these two scenarios, an owner or operator must submit a Form PI-E to TCEQ justifying the 
BACT or the determination of allowable emissions for the air contaminants relevant to the 
change.  TCEQ then has 45 days to review the request and either accept it or object.
Additionally, an owner or operator making a change under the program must 
notify TCEQ, either prior to or after the change.  Post change notification must come either 30 
days after the change, or in an annual report.  Pre-change notification is required when, in order 
to achieve a result of no net increase in allowable emissions, the owner or operator makes an 
intra-plant trade above set limits, depending on the location of the facility from the plant’s
boundaries.  An intra-plant trade is when an emission reductions is made at another qualified 
facility at the plant and is traded to the facility where the change is being made.45  
Two important aspects of the program are implicit in the pre-change notification 
requirement.  First, the rule only contemplates intra-plant trading.  Trading among different 
plants held by a common owner is not authorized under the program.  Second, TCEQ must be 
notified of intra-plant trading when the amounts traded are above a set limit.  
If a change implicates a permit special condition, the permit holder must revise its 
permit special condition using the procedures specified in Chapter 116, New Source Review.46

The program lacks safeguards to ensure that the changes will 
not violate a Texas control strategy and would not interfere 
with attainment and maintenance of NAAQs.
EPA Comments:

“The submitted Program’s netting is not based upon all 
contemporaneous increases at the same major stationary 
source and not all decreases at the same major stationary 
source. We propose, however, to find that such an approach 
satisfies the minimum requirements for an approvable Minor 
NSR netting program as long as the ambient air is protected in 
the trading.”

“The reductions in the Program’s netting are based upon the 
most stringent of the permitted emissions rate (which includes 
the highest achievable actual emission rate) or any applicable 
state or federal rule. Therefore, this Program’s netting is not 
based totally on changes in actual emissions. We are proposing 
to find that this still is acceptable as a Minor NSR netting 
program as long as the ambient air is protected in the 
trading.”
Group Response:
Qualified Facility flexibility is only available where the change will not result in a 
net increase above existing BACT-reviewed levels at well controlled facilities.  The program 
contemplates changes under existing limits that were set to protect the NAAQS and other air 
quality standards.
The existing Qualified Facility rules contain adequate safeguards that ensure that 
air quality, including NAAQS, are protected when changes are made under the program.  
Additionally, under the existing rules, changes are sufficiently documented and quantified so that 
a decrease at a facility will only be used in one netting analysis.
Section 116.117 governs the documentation and notification of changes made to 
qualified facility.  That provision specifies that a facility making a change under the program 
must document the change.  This documentation must include:
(1) [Q]uantification of all emissions increases and decreases associated 
with the physical or operation change;
(2) [A] description of the physical or operation change;
(3) [A] description of any equipment being installed;

HOU2:1184196.7

(4) [S]ufficient information as necessary to show that the project will 
comply with § 116.150 of this title (relating to Nonattainment Review) 
and §§ 116.160-116.163 of this title (relating to Prevention of Significant 
Deterioration Review) and with Subchapter C of this chapter (relating to 
Hazardous Air Pollutants: Regulations Governing Constructed Major 
Sources (FCAA, § 112(g), 40 CFR Part 63)).47
Section 116.117 goes on to require that a facility notify TCEQ of the changes made under the 
program.48  
The intersection of the requirements to document and to report the change to 
TCEQ means that a change may only be used in one netting analysis.  Additionally, the 
requirement that a source document compliance with NNSR and PSD review safeguards 
NAAQS.
4.
The program fails to demonstrate that, if viewed as an 
exception to the Texas Minor NSR permitting rules, it will not 
interfere with any applicable requirement of the Act.
EPA Comment:

“The submitted Program could be considered an exemption 
from Minor NSR.  To be approvable as an exemption from the 
Texas Minor NSR SIP, the State must demonstrate that this 
exemption will not permit changes that will violate the Texas 
control strategies or interfere with NAAQS attainment.”
Group Response:
The Qualified Facility program is correctly analyzed as a minor NSR applicability 
trigger.  As such, it could be viewed as an exemption to the Texas Minor NSR permitting review 
requirements.  The existing rules, however, sufficiently prevent changes that will violate the 
Texas control strategies or interfere with NAAQS attainment.
Qualified Facility flexibility is only available where the change will not result in a 
net increase above existing BACT-reviewed levels at well controlled facilities.  The program 
contemplates changes under existing limits that were set to protect the NAAQS and other air 
quality standards.
Further, as explained in Section III.B.3 above, § 116.117 requires that a 
modification under the program must be documented and an owner or operator specifically must 
show compliance with NNSR and PSD requirements.49  The state NNSR and PSD rules exist to

promote NAAQS attainment.  The Qualified Facility provisions, therefore, incorporate Texas’s 
control strategies, thus safeguarding the NAAQS.
IV.
Substance of Asserted Deficiencies for Definitions
A.
The removal of the incorporation by reference of the federal PSD definition 
of BACT.
EPA Comments:

“The 2006 submittal also removed from the State rules, the 
PSD SIP requirement at 40 CFR 52.21(r)(4). . . [This revision 
provides that] if a project becomes a major stationary source 
or major modification solely because of a relaxation of an 
enforceable limitation on the source or modification’s capacity 
to emit a pollutant, then the source or modification is subject to 
PSD applies as if construction had not yet commenced.”

“As the mechanism in Texas for ensuring that permits contain 
such a requirement, the State PSD SIP must both require 
BACT and apply the federal definition of BACT (or one that is 
more stringent) to be approved pursuant to part C and Section 
110(l) of the Act.”
Group Response:
Texas submitted a revision to 30 TAC 116.160(a) and a new section 116.160(c)(1) 
and (2) on February 1, 2006, as a SIP revision to the Texas PSD SIP.  This SIP revision 
reorganized the earlier SIP-approved rules.
Prior to the currently-reviewed revisions, Texas had incorporated by reference 
certain provisions of 40 CFR 52.21.  The current SIP-approved rule was adopted by the State on 
October 10, 2001, and EPA approved this recodified SIP rule citation on July 22, 2004.50    
Since 1972, Texas has correctly imposed a control technology review on 
applications for an air quality permit.51  Section 382.0518(b)(1) of the Texas Clean Air Act 
(“TCAA”)  requires that “the proposed facility for which a permit, permit amendment, or a 
special permit is sought will use at least the best available control technology, considering the 
technical practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions 
from the facility.”52  This requirement is echoed in Section 116.111(a)(2)(C) of TCEQ’s rules, 
which requires that “the proposed facility utilize BACT, with consideration given to the technical 
                                               
50 69 Fed. Reg. 43,752 (July 22, 2004).
51 See TACB, Regulation VI § I(B)(2) (July 5, 1972).  
52 TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.0518(b)(1).

HOU2:1184196.7
15
practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions from the 
facility.” 53
The term BACT has been defined by TCEQ in strict accordance with the statutory 
BACT requirement in the TCAA.  Specifically, 30 TAC § 116.10(3) defines BACT as “BACT 
with consideration given to the technical practicability and the economic reasonableness of 
reducing or eliminating emissions from the facility.”  The TCEQ has stated that this definition 
shall apply to all use of the term “BACT” in Chapter 116 of its rules, unless the context clearly 
indicates otherwise.54    
The Texas regulations have continuously carved out 40 CFR 52.21(j), concerning 
control technology review, which is the federal BACT requirement, from the Texas PSD 
regulations.  This is true from 1992 when EPA first granted authority to Texas to administer PSD 
permitting.  As part of the 1992 approval, EPA explained why the federal control technology 
review requirement of Section 52.21(j) could be properly excluded by Texas under the federal 
Clean Air Act.  EPA explained:
This provision of the Federal PSD regulations has been excluded
from the TACB Regulation VI because the TACB claims that the 
Texas Clean Air Act and the existing State regulations have 
provisions for application of BACT as stringent as the Federal 
requirements in reviewing the permit applications.  The EPA 
review of the Texas Clean Air Act and Regulation VI (Sections 
116.3(a)(3) through 116.3(a)(5)) have indeed revealed that existing 
TACB permit requirements meet the provisions of the Federal PSD 
regulations . . . .55
EPA then stated in the final rule approving the Texas PSD program that the federal control 
technology review requirement, which requires BACT for PSD applications, was “not necessary 
for approval of the Texas Program.”56
The preamble to the 2006 revisions to §116.160 in which the incorporations by 
reference of 40 CFR 52.21 were changed, demonstrate a consistency with the approach taken by 
the State in the preceding years.  The preamble explains the incorporation by reference of certain 
sections of 40 CFR 52.21 and further states, “[o]ther definitions used for the PSD program or 
visibility in Class I areas program are currently in [TCEQ’s] rules.”57  
The appropriate BACT definition exists in Texas’s rules, as demonstrated by 
EPA’s past approval of those rules.  All permits Texas has issued under the existing permitting 
program reflect the current TCEQ SIP-approved approach to BACT, and are valid and 
enforceable.

B.
The definition of “insignificant increases” as not requiring a permit does not 
meet EPA’s NSR SIP requirements.
EPA Comments:

“The TCAA seems to be clear that a Permit by Rule, Standard 
Permit, or an Exemption by Rule cannot be used for a major 
source or major modification.  EPA is aware that in the past 
the State has reasonably interpreted an applied the SIP term 
‘insignificant’ for allowing only minor modifications and 
minor sources.  There is information; however, e.g., the State’s 
adoption of a Permit by Rule for Startup, Shutdown, and 
Maintenance Emissions that belies the EPA being able to rely 
upon such a submittal of the relevant statutory provisions. This 
type of Permit by Rule cannot be construed to apply only to 
minor modifications and construction of minor sources. A 
submittal by the State of the applicable statutory sections for 
EPA to approve as part of the Texas SIP no longer seems 
sufficient in view of the issuance of this particular Permit by 
Rule.”

“With the State’s issuance of the Startup, Shutdown, and 
Maintenance Permit by Rule that is not clearly limited to minor 
modifications and the continued expressions by the public, 
regulated entities, and government entities on the lack of 
clarity in the submittals’ language of (A) and (B), EPA is 
proposing to disapprove the submittals for 30 TAC 
116.10(11)(A) and (B) because they are vague and 
unenforceable.”

HOU2:1184196.7
17
Group Response:
EPA’s concerns that Texas’s adoption of a Permit by Rule (“PBR”) for 
Maintenance Start-up and Shutdown (“MSS”) prevents it from approving the definition of 
modification of an existing facility as excluding “insignificant increase” are unfounded.  TCEQ 
proposed that rule in December of 2005.58  TCEQ, however, never actually adopted the rule.  
Consequently, it was withdrawn in July of 2006.59  EPA’s ability to rely on the state submittal of 
the applicable statutory sections, therefore, should not be undermined by a rule that was never 
adopted.
Additionally, the definition specifying that a modification of an existing facility 
does not include (1) an insignificant increase of an air contaminant that is authorized by one or 
more commission exemptions, or (2) an insignificant increase at a permitted facility60 is not 
vague.  As EPA recognizes, the Texas Clean Air Act clearly prevents an exemption from being 
used for a major source or major modification.61  Consequently, the definition is limited to minor 
modifications.
V.
Conclusion
The Group strongly supports full approval of existing Texas Qualified Facility 
provisions and the existing definitions.  The Texas permitting program, including the definitions 
and Qualified Facility program provisions, is stringent, comprehensive and protective of both the 
environment and public health.  The Texas SIP revisions, including Qualified Facility provisions 
and defined terms, further the attainment of NAAQS, and so should be fully approved.

I.
Introduction
The Group strongly supports full approval of the flexible permit provisions.  The 
Texas air quality permitting program, including the flexible permit provisions, is stringent, 
comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.  
Under Texas’s integrated air permitting regime, air quality in the state is 
demonstrating strong, sustained improvement.  Between 1999 and 2005, NOX emissions in the 
Houston-Galveston area decreased from almost 1,200 tons per day, to under 600 tons per day.1  
Ozone as measured under the one-hour standard in the Houston-Galveston area has declined 
from 220 parts per billion (“ppb”) in 1991 to 127 ppb in 2009.2  Under the eight-hour standard, 
ozone in the Houston-Galveston area has declined from 119 ppb in 1991, to 84 ppb in 2009.3  
There has been a similar improvement in toxic air emissions.  Between 2003 and 2008, there has 
been a 50% decrease in highly reactive volatile organic compounds (“HRVOCs”) in the Houston 
area.4  Similarly, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, ozone as measured under the one-hour standard 
declined from 140 ppb in 1991 to 115 ppb in 2009.5  Ozone for the Dallas-Fort Worth area under 
the eight-hour standard has declined from 105 ppb in 1991 to 86 ppb in 2009.6  Moreover, 
between 1988 and 2008, there has been an 80% reduction in VOC compound indicators in the

Houston area.7  Notably, according to recent TCEQ review, all areas of Texas are in attainment 
for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.8
Further, the data show that stationary sources have contributed more substantial 
emissions reductions than any other category during the period of most dramatic air quality 
improvements.  In the Houston-Galveston area between 1993 and 2008, NOX emissions from 
stationary sources declined from 695 tons per day (“tpd”), to 156 tpd, a decrease of 539 tpd.9  
During that same period, emissions from on-road source declined from 416 tpd to 175 tpd, a 
decrease of 241 tpd.10  Similarly, stationary sources made significant decreases for VOC.  
Between 1993 and 2009 in the Houston-Galveston area, VOC emissions from stationary sources 
decreased from 411 tpd, to 170 tpd, a decrease of 241 tpd.11  On-road sources from that same 
period decreased from 199 tpd, to 86 tpd, a decrease of 113 tpd.12  As the figures indicate, 
stationary sources in Texas have made the most significant strides in reducing emissions.
The submitted revisions strengthen a previously SIP-approved Texas program. 
Under the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “Act”), SIP revisions are approved when those 
revisions do not interfere with the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(“NAAQS”).  States have the primary responsibility for developing plans for the attainment and 
maintenance of the NAAQS.  In fact, as the Fifth Circuit recently explained:
Although EPA is required to approve SIPs that provide for the timely 
attainment and subsequent maintenance of primary and secondary ambient 
air standards as well as satisfy other CAA general requirements, see 42 
U.S.C. § 7410(a)(3), the EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a 
State’s choices of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that 
otherwise satisfies the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. §7410(a)(2).13
Rather, the proper test for determining whether a SIP revision can be approved is whether the 
revision interferes with attainment of the NAAQS (i.e. that the plan does not make air quality 
worse).14  Far from   “worse” air quality, the last ten years have seen an unprecedented 
improvement in Texas air quality.  The submitted revisions have been fully integrated 
components of the Texas air quality permitting program for all that time.  Because the current 
SIP submittals function to strengthen the existing SIP, such submittal does not raise interference 
concerns, and should be fully approved.

II.
Flexibility in Federal Permitting Rules
A.
Title V Operating Permits
For twenty years, federal air permitting regulations have consistently recognized 
the importance of providing operational flexibility to the regulated community.  In 1990, 
Congress added Title V to the Clean Air Act (“CAA” or “the Act”).  The Act specifies what 
EPA must require of states’ federal operating permit programs.  Specifically, state Title V 
programs must contain: 
Provisions to allow changes within a permitted facility . . . without 
requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any 
provision of title I and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable 
under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in 
terms of total emissions).15
Thus, Congress specifically envisioned emission cap permits in structuring the Title V program.
Two years later, in 1992, EPA promulgated its rules for Title V permit programs 
in 40 C.F.R. Part 70.  In order to provide operational flexibility, EPA promulgated section 
70.4(b)(12), which requires that states put in place Title V programs that allow three specific 
avenues for operational flexibility, including permits that establish federally-enforceable 
emission caps in their Title V programs.  Specifically:
The program shall require the permitting authority, if a permit applicant 
requests it, to issue permits that contain terms and conditions, . . . allowing 
for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted 
facility solely for the purpose of complying with a federally-enforceable 
emissions cap that is established in the permit independent of otherwise 
applicable requirements. 16
EPA emphasized the importance of enabling plant sites to maintain operational 
flexibility in the preamble to Part 70.  There, EPA stated:
[I]t is possible to use the combination of several provisions in these 
regulations 
to 
allow 
for 
operational 
flexibility 
around 
federally-enforceable emission limits or caps which are more strict than 
otherwise required by the Act's applicable requirements.  A source may 
request that the 
permit 
provide 
for 
emissions 
trading 
under 
§ 70.4(b)(12)(iii), as discussed above.  For example, a source could 
structure its permit so that the emissions caps at the permitted facility 
created a pool of unused emissions under the voluntary limit on the 
source's potential to emit. 17

HOU02:1186042.1

At least 24 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the language of 
Section 70.4(b)(12) into their Title V permit programs.18  Several of these states embraced the 
concept of “federally enforceable emission caps” that authorize emissions, not only as a title V 
revision trigger, but also as an authorization tool under NSR.19  Thus, emission cap permits have 
deep roots outside Texas. 
B.
Flexible Permit Pilot Study
EPA again focused on the importance of operational flexibility when it conducted 
its decade-long Flexible Permit pilot study.  EPA reviewed flexible emission cap permits in six 
states, and found that flexible permits worked well and could be used to further both 
environmental protection and administrative flexibility.20  Behind the project was a recognition 
by both the states involved and EPA that “in today’s increasingly competitive global markets,” 
companies are required “to respond rapidly to market signals and demand, while delivering 
products faster, at lower cost, and of equal or better quality than their competitors.”21  EPA 
recognized that flexible permits could reduce the administrative “friction” of time, costs, delay, 
uncertainty, and risk associated with certain types of operational changes.22
C.
Plantwide Applicability Limits
EPA recognized the advantages of emissions cap permits in promulgating its NSR 
reform in 1996 and 2002.  In introducing the plantwide applicability limit (“PAL”) concept in 
1996, EPA noted:
Rather than face complicated, piecemeal applicability decisions every 
time a change at a plant is contemplated, plant managers may prefer to 
work within an emissions cap or emissions budget, an annual emissions 
limit that allows managers to make almost any change anytime as long as 
the plant’s emissions do not exceed the cap.23
When promulgating its final NSR reform rule in 2002, EPA reiterated the benefits of emission 
caps, reflecting on its experience with the flexible permit pilot project.  EPA stated:

Overall, we found that significant environmental benefits occurred for 
each of the permits reviewed.  In particular, the six flexible permits 
established emissions cap-based frameworks that encouraged emissions 
reductions and pollution prevention, even though such environmental 
improvements were not an explicit requirement of the permits.  We found 
that in a cap-based program, sources strive to create enough headroom for 
future expansions by voluntarily controlling emissions. For instance, one 
company lowered its actual VOC emissions over threefold in becoming a 
synthetic minor  source (that is, 190 tpy to 56 tpy).  Other companies 
lowered their actual VOC emissions by as much as 3600 tpy by increasing 
capture, by using voluntary pollution prevention and other voluntary 
emissions control measures, and by reducing production rates.24  
D.
EPA’s Proposed Indian Country Rule
In 2006, EPA proposed an air permitting rule for Indian Country.  In the preamble 
to that proposed rule, EPA once again expressed the importance of flexibility in air permitting 
programs.  EPA intended the rule to be a representative template of state NSR programs that 
serve to provide operational flexibility while leveling the regulatory playing field:
[W]e seek to establish a flexible preconstruction permitting program for 
minor stationary sources in Indian country that is comparable to that 
which applies outside of Indian country, in order to create a more level 
regulatory playing field . . . .  [T]his can serve as one example of a 
program that meets the objectives and requirements of the Act.25
Moreover, the proposed rule for Indian Country contains a permit structure that embraces the 
emissions cap principle in the form of minor and major PALs. 26
E.
EPA’s Flexible Air Permit Rule
Most recently, in October of 2009, EPA promulgated the federal Flexible Air 
Permitting (“FAP”) Rule.  Through this rulemaking, EPA incorporated changes into Title V 
rules that were “intended to clarify and reaffirm opportunities for accessing operational 
flexibility under existing regulations.”27  
In the preamble to the rule, EPA supported flexibility in air permitting.  “[W]e . . . 
intend to support states and sources who wish to explore the flexibilities available under the 
existing major NSR regulations.”28  Additionally, EPA recognized that state permitting 
authorities have discretion to preapprove minor NSR changes.  “As a general matter, the 
permitting authorities have authority to decide, on a case-by-case basis, the merits of granting an

advance approval of minor NSR to a particular requesting source.”29  The final rule does not call 
for state Title V or NSR program revisions, but reaffirms pre-existing authority for states to craft 
three forms of flexible air permits.  “The purpose of this rulemaking is to clarify and reaffirm 
opportunities within the existing regulatory framework to encourage the wider use of the FAP 
approaches.”30
III.
Overview of Texas Flexible Permit Program
The TCEQ's flexible permit regulations in 30 TAC Chapter 116, Subchapter G 
were promulgated in 1994 as a flexible mechanism to comply with State minor NSR permitting 
requirements.  This program was established as a way to encourage facilities to install controls 
that would not otherwise be required in exchange for operational flexibility associated with 
emission caps.  Under the flexible permit program, a permittee can seek pollutant-specific caps 
that cover certain facilities at the site.  These caps are established based on the application of 
BACT to all of the facilities contributing to the emissions cap.31  In exchange for this greater 
level of control, sites are provided with an alternative to individual facility emission limits (for 
the covered facilities) as long as the site complies with the emission limits set by the cap.  
The flexible permit also calls for the use of individual emission limitations in 
certain situations.32  Individual limits are used when it is necessary to control off-property 
impacts, such as impacts from air toxics, or to meet the NAAQS.  Specific emission limits that 
an individual facility cannot exceed may also be established to ensure that federal permitting 
requirements are not circumvented.33  
The flexible permit program has been quite successful in achieving emission 
reductions.  For example, flexible permitting has resulted in a reduction of more than 25,000 tons 
tpy of SO2 and more than 10,000 tpy of NOx at a coal and petroleum coke fired power plant and 
a reduction of more than 4,800 tpy of SO2 and CO from a petroleum refinery.  
Issuance of a flexible permit has no impact on the permit holder's obligation to 
comply with federal PSD or nonattainment NSR (“NNSR”) requirements.  In fact, for projects 
that constitute major sources or modifications, TCEQ issues a major source permit (PSD or 
NNSR) in addition to the state flexible permit.

The Texas definition of “modification” is not clearly at least as 
stringent as the definition of “modification” in EPA’s Major 
NSR SIP rules.
EPA Comment:

“In evaluating Major NSR SIP revision submittals impacting 
‘‘major modifications,’’ that differ from EPA’s, our review is 
primarily guided by section 111(a)(4) of the Act that describes 
when a ‘‘source’’ is to be considered modified: ‘‘The term 
‘modification’ means any physical change in, or change in the 
method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the 
amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which 
results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.’’  
Texas did not submit any demonstration showing how its use of the 
definition ‘‘modification’’ was at least as stringent as the 
definition of ‘‘modification’’ in EPA’s Major NSR SIP rules.  In 
conducting our review, we particularly were mindful of the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
regarding the scope and requirements of Section 111(a)(4) for 
determining whether a change is a ‘‘major modification.’’ See e.g., 
New York v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (‘‘New York I’’) 
(evaluating EPA’s 2002 revised major NSR rules and interpreting 
Section 111(a)(4)).”
Group Response:
TCEQ rules provide two separate “modification” definitions.  Briefly, a “major 
modification” is a project action that triggers federal NSR review (PSD or Nonattainment).34  In 
contrast the TCEQ’s minor source program uses the definition of “modification of an existing 
facility” to determine if a proposed change triggers minor NSR review, and the scope of the 
change is not limited to pollutants that are federally regulated.35  TCEQ has explicitly stated that 
the flexible permit rules and the definition of “modification of an existing facility” do not act as 
a shield for federal NSR permitting.36  
Moreover, EPA itself distinguished the definition of “modification” under minor 
NSR from that used for major NSR.  In the preamble to its proposed Indian Country rules, EPA 
explained:
                                               
34 30 TAC § 116.12(18) , defined as “a physical change or change in the method of operation of a major stationary 
source that causes a significant project emissions increase of a federally regulated new source review pollutant, and 
a significant net emissions increase of a federally regulated new source review pollutant which triggers federal 
review, such as PSD or nonattainment review.”
35 30 TAC § 116.10(11), defined as “a physical change or change in the method of operation of a facility which 
causes an increase in the amount of any air contaminant emitted by the facility into the atmosphere or results in an 
emission of any air contaminant not previously emitted.”

In a recent decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that, based 
on the wording of the definition of “modification” in section 111(a)(4) of 
the Act, the applicability of major NSR to modifications must be based on 
changes in actual emissions (State of New York, et., v. U.S. EPA, June 24, 
2005).  However, because the statutory basis for the minor NSR program 
is section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act, which does not define or refer to a 
definition of “modification,” we believe that we have discretion in 
defining the term as we think best for the minor NSR program in Indian 
Country . . . .37
Similarly, Texas has discretion in defining the term for purposes of minor NSR.
Additionally, in 2000, the U.S. EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) 
confirmed that there is no “legally prescribed methodology” for the emissions test used for minor 
NSR applicability determinations, and rejected the argument made by EPA enforcement 
personnel that, in the absence of an explicit minor NSR methodology in State rules, the minor 
NSR applicability test must be consistent with that used for federal PSD purposes.38  
2.
The program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR, thereby 
allowing new major stationary sources to construct without a 
Major NSR permit.
EPA Comments:

“[U]nlike the minor NSR SIP rules for Standard Permits in 30 
TAC 116.610(b) and Permits by Rule in 30 TAC 106.4(a)(3) 
and(4), the submitted rules do not require that construction of a 
major stationary source or a major modification, as defined in the 
Major NSR SIP regulations, must meet the Major NSR permitting 
requirements.”

“If Texas truly intends for the submitted Flexible Permits State 
Program to apply only to minor NSR, at a minimum Texas must 
amend Subchapter G to include additional provisions that clearly 
limit its applicability to minor NSR as it did in the Texas minor 
NSR SIP at 30 TAC Chapter 106 for Permits by Rule and 30 TAC 
Chapter 116 Subchapter F for Standard Permits.”
Group Response:
A flexible permit may be used for major and minor projects under the Texas rules.  
The rules make clear, however, that every project for which a flexible permit is issued must also 
comply with federal NSR requirements.  As explained above, for projects that constitute major

sources or modifications, TCEQ issues a major source permit (PSD or NNSR) in addition to the 
state flexible permit.  
The flexible permit rules distinguish between flexible permit and federal NSR 
requirements, and make explicit a flexible permit holder's obligation to comply with those 
federal NSR requirements:
●
§ 116.711(1) states that a flexible permit application must demonstrate that ""[t]he 
emissions from the proposed facility, group of facilities, or account . . . will 
comply with all rules and regulations of the commission,"" which includes 
Division 5 (nonattainment NSR) and Division 6 (PSD) of Subchapter B.39
●
§ 116.711(8):  ""Nonattainment review.  If the proposed facility, group of facilities, 
or account is located in a nonattainment area, each facility shall comply with all 
applicable requirements concerning nonattainment review of this chapter.""40
●
§ 116.711(9):  ""Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Review.  If the 
proposed facility, group of facilities, or account is located in an attainment area, 
each facility shall comply with all applicable requirements in this chapter 
concerning PSD review.""41
●
§ 116.718 states that the emissions increase at a facility covered by a flexible 
permit that does not exceed the emission cap is insignificant ""for the purposes of 
state new source review under this subchapter.""  The flexibility provided flexible 
permit holders to make physical or operational changes under the cap is limited to 
minor NSR.42
●
§ 116.720: “Neither operational nor physical changes authorized under this 
subchapter may result in an increase in actual emissions at facilities not covered 
by the flexible permit unless those affected facilities are authorized pursuant to 
§116.110 of this title (relating to Applicability).”  Section 116.110 requires an 
applicability review that can trigger nonattainment NSR or PSD review.
In light of these safeguards, the flexible permit rules constrain the regulated 
community from making major changes without complying with major NSR requirements.   
Regulated entities are subject to clear requirements for the applicability of PSD and NNSR.  Any 
attempts by a permittee to circumvent the federal NSR rules is properly addressed through the 
enforcement process, not by mandating redundant rule language as an approval condition.

EPA Comment:

“The submitted Program fails to require that the applicability 
of the Major NSR requirements be evaluated prior to 
considering whether the construction of a new source or 
making a change can be authorized under a Flexible Permit.”
Group Response:
As outlined above, Texas regulations explicitly require permit holders to comply 
with federal NSR rules.  Additionally, TCEQ rules such as § 116.150, governing New Major 
Source or Major Modification in Ozone Nonattainment Areas, § 116.151, governing New Major 
Source or Major Modification in Nonattainment Area Other than Ozone, and §§ 116.160-163 
governing the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Requirements, make clear that applicants 
for a flexible permit are subject to an applicability demonstration for both Nonattainment review 
and PSD review.  In light of these regulations, the Texas structure contains adequate safeguards 
to ensure that flexible permit applications are subject to federal NSR analyses and comply with 
federal NSR.
4.
The Texas definition of “account” may result in an emission 
cap applying to multiple major stationary sources.
EPA Comments:

“Texas SIP defines an “account” to include an entire company 
site, which could include more than one plant and certainly more 
than one major stationary source. . . Accordingly, under a Flexible 
Permit, a single emissions limitation in the emission cap could 
apply to multiple major stationary sources.”

“By allowing an emission cap to be established for an account, 
which can include multiple major stationary sources, the submitted 
SIP revisions may allow a major stationary  source to net a 
significant emissions increase against a decrease occurring 
outside the major stationary source, from facilities on the 
account’s site that are covered under the Flexible Permit.”
Group Response:
TCEQ rules provide that the definition of “Account” is tied to the definition of
“Site.”  30 TAC 101.1(1) defines “Account”:  
For those sources required to be permitted under Chapter 122 of this title 
(relating to Federal Operating Permits Program), all sources that are 
aggregated as a site.   For all other sources, any combination of sources 
under common ownership or control and located on one or more 

HOU02:1186042.1
11
contiguous properties, or properties contiguous except for intervening 
roads, railroads, rights-of-way, waterways, or similar divisions.43
Therefore, an account for any major stationary source is limited to a specific plant site.  The Title 
V rules, specifically § 122.10(27), provide that a Site is defined as “[t]he total of all stationary 
sources located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under common 
control of the same person . . . .”  The flexible permit rules specify that only one flexible permit 
may be issued at an account site and a flexible permit may not cover sources at more than one 
account site.44  
Moreover, the regulations governing NNSR and PSD are clear that emissions 
increases are evaluated on a project level rather than increases across a site.  For example, 
§116.150 states that the NNSR netting analysis is required unless “the proposed emissions 
increases associated with a project, without regard to decreases, is less than 5 tons per year of 
the individual nonattainment pollutant in areas classified  . . . as Serious or Severe.”45  Similarly, 
§ 116.160 states that “netting is required for all modification to existing major sources of 
federally regulated new source review pollutants, unless the proposed emissions increases 
associated with a project, without regard to decreases, are less than major modification 
thresholds for the pollutant . . . .”46  
Reading these rules together shows that they provide sufficient safeguards against 
a major stationary source netting a significant emissions increase against a decrease occurring 
outside a site using a flexible permit.
5.
Lack of a program requirement for ""crosswalks"" from prior 
Minor and Major NSR permit terms.  
EPA Comments:

“The more intricate a plan, the greater the need for detailed 
requirements.”

“[T]he lack of a program requirement for records with 
detailed 
crosswalks 
and 
of 
tracking 
and 
reporting 
requirements, one cannot determine which grandfathered units 
on a site are covered or not by a Flexible Permit, or which pre-
existing minor NSR permitted units are covered or not by a 
Flexible Permit, much less which permit terms, limits, and 
conditions are covered, are not covered, are retained, or not.”

The flexible permit rules require special conditions and other necessary 
conditions, such as requirements for monitoring, testing, recordkeeping, and reporting.47  When a 
flexible permit incorporates facilities that were previously authorized under an existing PSD 
and/or nonattainment permit, TCEQ identifies the special conditions initially contained in those 
federal permits with the appropriate notation (PSD), (NA), or (PSD and NA) in the conditions.48  
The permit representations are also carried forward into the flexible permit.49
An owner or operator can request to change the conditions contained in every 
Texas permit if the circumstances warrant, the applicable requirements are met, and TCEQ 
approves the change.50  Consequently, the rules contemplate that a permittee may request a 
change in conditions from earlier-issued permits when applying for a flexible permit.51  If such 
changes to representations are proposed, those changes are reviewed, and monitoring and 
recordkeeping requirements, consistent with any proposed changes in representations, are then 
added to the special conditions of the permit.52  
For flexible permits that contain major sources authorized under existing PSD 
and/or nonattainment permits, the PSD and/or nonattainment permits are consolidated into the 
flexible permit for tracking purposes.  There is no removal of control requirements, or reduction 
in the level of monitoring or testing.53
B.
Minor NSR Approval Issues
1.
The program is not clearly limited to Minor NSR, thereby 
allowing new major stationary sources to construct without a 
Major NSR permit.
EPA Comment:

“There are no statutory and/or regulatory provisions that 
clearly prohibit the use of the Program for major stationary 
sources and major modifications. Nor are there any statutory 
and/or regulatory provisions clearly limiting the use of the 
Program to minor sources and/or minor modifications. There 
are no provisions that prohibit the use of the Program for 
construction of new major stationary sources and major 
modifications of existing major stationary sources and minor 
sources.”

Group Response:
The Group reiterates the points made in Section IV.A.1 above.  A flexible permit 
may be used for major and minor projects under the Texas rules.  The rules make clear, however, 
that every project for which a flexible permit is issued must also comply with federal NSR 
requirements.  As explained above, for projects that constitute major sources or modifications, 
TCEQ issues a major source permit (PSD or NNSR) in addition to the state flexible permit.  
Texas’s flexible permit rules explicitly state that sources applying for flexible 
permits are subject to federal NSR.  The rules constrain the regulated community from making 
major modifications without complying with federal NSR requirements.  
2.
The 
program 
lacks 
replicable, 
specific, 
established 
implementation procedures for establishing the emission cap in 
a Minor NSR Flexible Permit.
EPA Comments:

“There are not specific, established, replicable procedures 
providing available means to determine independently, and for 
different scenarios, how the State will calculate a Flexible 
Permit’s cap and/or individual emissions limitations for a 
company’s site, plants on the site, major stationary sources on 
the site, a facility within a major stationary source on the site, 
facilities on the site, a group of units on the site, for one 
pollutant but not another, etc.”

“Because applicants can choose to establish caps or individual 
emission limitations for just certain pollutants rather than for 
all pollutants emitted from the source(s) included in the 
Flexible Permit, the submitted Program also must contain 
legally enforceable procedures for determining both the cap 
and individual emissions limitations for each relevant pollutant 
for each source and address how sources or pollutants not 
included in the Flexible Permit will be regulated.”
Group Response:
Under the Texas rules, an emissions cap is calculated using the maximum 
expected activity or operating level of a facility and the current BACT applied to each facility. In 
other words, the emissions cap is the sum of the well-controlled emissions of each facility under 
the cap.54  Emission caps are generally calculated for each specific criteria pollutant and other 
pollutants as necessary or desired by the company obtaining the flexible permit.  The permittee is 
required to meet BACT as applied to all facilities individually contributing to a particular 
emission cap.
                                               
54 30 TAC §116.716.

HOU02:1186042.1
14
The flexible permit also allows for the use of individual emission limitations.55  
Individual emission limits are used when it is necessary to ensure protection of off-property 
impacts, such as control of air toxics, or to meet the NAAQS.  Specific emission limits that an 
individual facility can not exceed may also be established to ensure that federal permitting 
requirements are not circumvented.56
The rules do contain an established and replicable method for determining an 
emissions cap.  Namely, the rules require that each flexible permit involve the summing of 
BACT emission rates.  While BACT determinations may vary between specific types of sources, 
the use of federal and state BACT guidance results in a replicable procedure for establishing 
caps.
Additionally, the rules require that an applicant indentify “each facility” to be 
included in the flexible permit and to identify “each contaminant for which an emission cap is 
desired.”57  
The flexible permits rules do not change the rule governing facilities and 
pollutants not addressed in a plant’s flexible permit.  Facilities not incorporated into a plant’s 
flexible permit remain subject to their existing authorizations.  This applies with equal force to 
pollutants not covered by a flexible permit.  If a pollutant is not addressed by a flexible permit, 
the emissions of that pollutant remain subject to existing permit limits.
3.
Lack of a program requirement for ""crosswalks"" from prior 
Minor and Major NSR permit terms and other requirements 
of the Texas SIP.  
EPA Comment:

“We also are proposing to disapprove the submitted Program 
because it would allow holders of a Flexible Permit to make de 
facto amendments of existing SIP permits including changes in 
the terms and conditions (such as throughput, fuel type, hours 
of operation) of minor and major NSR permits, without a 
preconstruction review by Texas.”

4.
The program lacks the necessary more specialized monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting (MRR) requirements required 
for this type of Minor NSR program.
EPA Comment:

“The submitted Program lacks provisions explicitly addressing 
the type of monitoring requirements that are necessary to 
ensure that all of the movement of emissions between the 
emission points, units, facilities, plants, etc., still meet the cap 
for the pollutant, still meet the individual emissions limitations, 
and still meet any other applicable state or federal 
requirement.”
Group Response:
The Texas rules’ stringent provisions for monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting require the regulated community to monitor and submit information sufficient to 
safeguard environmental quality.
As explained above, TCEQ issues flexible permits with conditions on 
recordkeeping, monitoring, and reporting.  All flexible permits require recordkeeping that 
contains:
[D]ata sufficient to demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 
caps and individual emission limitations contained in the flexible permit 
shall be maintained in a file at the plant site and made available at the 
request of personnel from the commission or any air pollution control 
program having jurisdiction. . . .  This information may include, but is not 
limited to, emission cap and individual emission limitation calculations 
based on a 12-month rolling basis and production records and operating 
hours. Additional recordkeeping requirements may be specified in special 
conditions attached to the flexible permit.58
The flexible permit rules contemplate that additional recordkeeping requirements may be tailored 
to the type of source covered by a flexible permit.  In this way, the Texas recordkeeping 
requirements are as stringent, if not more stringent, than federal rules.
The Group believes that a comparison of Texas’s reporting requirements to the 
reporting requirements of the proposed Indian Country minor NSR rules highlight that the Texas 
requirements are as stringent, if not more stringent.  That rule requires:
                                               
58 Id. §116.715(c)(6) (emphasis added).

(i) Annual submittal of reports of monitoring required under paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, including the type and frequency of monitoring, and 
a summary of results obtained by monitoring.
(ii) Prompt reporting of deviations from permit requirements, including 
those attributable to upset conditions as defined in the permit, the probable 
cause of such deviations, and any corrective actions or preventive 
measures taken. Within the permit, the reviewing authority must define 
‘‘prompt’’ in relation to the degree and type of deviation likely to occur 
and the applicable emission limitations.59
Further, with respect to emission events and MSS, Texas requirements go far 
beyond federal benchmarks.  The Texas flexible permit rules require that permit holders comply 
with Sections 101.201 and 101.211, which govern reporting and recordkeeping of emissions 
events and maintenance, startup, and shutdown reporting.60  Section 101.201 requires that the 
owner or operator of a regulated entity experiencing an emissions event “shall create a final 
record of all reportable and non-reportable emissions events as soon as practicable, but no later 
than two weeks after the end of an emissions event.”61  This two-week period is even more 
stringent than the proposed Indian Country provision requiring “prompt” reporting of emissions 
events.  
Section 101.201 of the Texas rules also requires that permit holders retain records 
both for emissions events that are reportable and those that are not reportable.  The provisions for 
non-reportable events contain requirements similar to the proposed Indian Country rule.  Those 
records must be maintained on-site for a minimum of five years and be made readily available 
upon request to commission staff or personnel of any air pollution program with jurisdiction.62   
Additionally, records on non-reportable emissions events are required to include: 
(1) the physical location of the points at which emissions to the atmosphere 
occurred; 
(2) the date and time of the discovery of the emissions event;  
(3) the estimated duration of the emissions; 
(4) the compound descriptive type of the individually listed compounds or 
mixtures of air contaminants, from all emission points involved in the emissions 
event, that are known through common process knowledge or past engineering 
analysis;
(5) the estimated total quantities and the authorized emissions limits for those 
specified compounds or mixtures;
(6) the preconstruction authorization number or rule citation of the standard 
permit, permit by rule, or rule, if any, governing the facilities involved in the 
emissions event; and the authorized emissions limits, if any, for the facilities 
involved in the emissions events;
(7) the basis used for determining the quantity of air contaminants emitted;

§ 101.10 requires permit holders to submit emissions inventories that detail “actual 
emissions of VOC, NOx, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), lead (Pb), 
particulate matter of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), any other contaminant 
subject to NAAQS, emissions of all HAPs identified in FCAA §112(b), or any other 
contaminant requested by the commission from individual emission units within an 
account.”64

§ 115.116 requires recordkeeping for specified storage tanks for VOCs.  Permit 
holders must inspect those tanks and record, among other things, a calculation of 
emissions for all secondary seal gaps that exceed 1/8 inch (0.32 centimeter) where the 
accumulated area of such gaps is greater than 1.0 square inch per foot (21 square 
centimeters per meter) of tank diameter. These calculated emissions inventory 
reportable emissions must be reported in the annual emissions inventory submittal 
required by §101.10 of this title (relating to Emissions Inventory Requirements).65

§ 117.801 requires reporting on stack testing for NOX emissions.  These reports 
include data summarizing emission rates found, reported in the units of the applicable 
emission limits and averaging periods, the maximum rated capacity, normal 
maximum capacity, and actual operating level of the unit during the test (in million 
British thermal units, horsepower, or megawatts, as applicable), and description of the 
method used to determine such operating level; the operating parameters of any active 
nitrogen oxides (NOX ) control equipment during the test; and documentation that no 
changes to the unit have occurred since the compliance test was conducted that could 
result in a significant change in NOX emissions.66

§ 111.111 requires that flare logs be kept that detail when flares are observed 
including the time of day and whether or not the flare was smoking. “Flare operators 
shall record at least 98% of these required observations.”67
A review of all Texas MRR requirements shows that sources operating under 
flexible permits are subject to a thorough and rigorous MRR regime.

The Group strongly supports full approval of existing Texas flexible permit 
provisions.  The Texas permitting program, including the flexible permit provisions, is stringent, 
comprehensive and protective of both the environment and public health.  Consistent with the 
findings of EPA’s Flexible Permit Pilot Study,68 flexible permits in Texas have contributed to the 
sustained improvement of air quality in Texas.  The Texas SIP revisions, including flexible 
permits, further the attainment of NAAQS, and so should be fully approved.

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ)
is broken.
I
applaud EPA1s proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act,
and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.
Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by TCEQ
utilizing TCEQ 1s current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions,
no bailouts,
and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
-
Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions,
and is on the top
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past five
years.
Texans deserve better.
We cannot let coal stand in the way of
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules in
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for their mess
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting process are
allowed to proceed forward.
Strong regulations are vital to cleaning
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy
technology that boosts economic growth,
creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
Here in San Antonio,
we can purchase wind energy through the Windtricity program of City
Public Service,
our utility company.
I
have done so as a vote of
confidence in clean energy sources.
Yet individual choices can have
only so much effect.
I urge you to prevent the creation of more coal
plants as they are backward-looking, polluting and costly.
Sincerely,
Ms.

Party submitting comments
These comments are submitted on behalf of the Concerned Citizens of
Grayson County (""CCGC""), which is a group ofcitizens, including retired
United States District Judge Paul Brown, living in and near Denison and
Sherman, Texas. The CCGC has been concerned for quite some time with a
permanent hot mix asphalt plant located just outside the western edge of
Denison, near the small town of Pottsboro, which is a gateway to Lake
Texoma and the extensive recreational activities there. (This asphalt plant
was generally known as the Rushing Paving plant, but, since its ownership changed
after the plant opened, it will be referred to here as ""Asphalt Plant No.4"".) Its
location near Pottsboro public schools and near numerous private residences
has caused significant disruptions in the lives of those living nearby,
especially given the noxious stench repeatedly emitted from the plant.
Background to CCGC's concerns and comments
In March 2007, TCEQ approved Asphalt Plant No. 4's registration to
operate under the standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants. TCEQ had
issued the standard permit nearly four years earlier, on July 9,2003. CCGC
and numerous other individuals, including Judge Brown, filed suit in state
court in Austin, Texas, challenging the authorization for Asphalt Plant No.
4. (The case was Concerned Citizens of Grayson County v. TCEQ, No. Tr-l»

ON-07-001064, in the 419'""Judicial District, Travis County.)* The essence of
the challenge was directed at the procedural and substantive shortcomings in
the underlying standard permit which TCEQ's Commissioners had approved
in 2003 after only perfunctory consideration by them.
TCEQ's defense was based on basic two points. First, the CCOC's
lawsuit came four years late, since (according to TCEQ) the only challenge
the local citizenry could have lodged was to TCEQ's issuance of the standard
permit in 20m-and CCOC and its allies had not sued back then. Second,
the CCOC could not have sued back then anyway because the Texas
Legislature, in Section 382.05195 (g) of the Texas Health & Safety Code, has
made the state's Administrative Procedure Act inapplicable to TCEQ's
development and implementation of standard permits-with the result that
there were no judicially enforceable legal standards to apply as to the
standard permit anyway, so why bother with addressing the facts of the case.
TCEQ's argument was successful, and the district court entered
judgment against CCOC and the other plaintiffs this past February, affirming
TCEQ's authorization for Asphalt Plant No.4 to operate under the 2003
standard permit. Lack of resources and, even more, a complete absence of
confidence in the integrity of the entire process by which TCEQ handles air
pollution permitting led the CCOC group to forego any appeal.
Texas standard permit process effectively freezes out the public
The insidious nature of the process which Texas has developed for
standard permits prompts the CCOC group to submit these comments. Their
objective is to convince EPA that, to the extent the current issues opened by
the EPA's proposed rule on Texas's SIP do not encompass the matters raised
in the Asphalt Plant No.4 process, something must be done to open Texas's
standard permitting process to greater public scrutiny and involvement. For
now, it is nothing but a cozyaffairbetween TCEQ and the regulated
industry.
The biggest problem with TCEQ's successful insulation of Asphalt Plant
No.4 from any meaningful public review and comment whatever is that it
• CCGC encloses with these comments the briefs filed by the parties in the litigation and the state
district court's final judgment.

exemplifies the closed nature of the standard permitting process. TCEQ and
the Texas Legislature have purposefully structured it this way. The affected
industry works with TCEQ to sculpt the standard permit to its standards.
Then, in a year or two or three, when a plant comes onto the local scene
waving the standard permit, the local citizenry is concretely affected for the
first time, but told that it should have been involved years ago, when the
permit was being developed.
In the instance of the standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants, the
record is indisputably plain that the public was entirely frozen out of the
process. The public simplywas not involved in the 2002-2003 rulemaking
process. The administrative record for the hot mix asphalt plant rulemaking
reflects that there was only a single comment from outside the realm of
industry (this coming from a Harris County agency). The sign-in sheets for
TCEQ's ostensibly ""public hearings"" show that only industry and trade
groups with financial interests in the asphalt plant business attended. The
written comments effectivelycame only from this same self-interested group.
It is true, of course, that the public was not told by TCEQ that it could not
comment and attend the public sessions. But, the process was legislatively
and administratively crafted in such a way that the reality would be that only
trade and industry would attend, comment, and have influence. The reason
is obvious. Take the CCGC situation and Asphalt Plant No.4 as a prime
example. In 2002-2003, the local residents in Grayson County had no way to
know that they should be concerned about the hot mix asphalt standard
permit then under development because they were not faced with a single
asphalt plant proposal to operate in the area. Asphalt Plant No.4 wasn't
even on the radar screen at the time. No one was proposing a plant in the
area, and local people had plenty to do beyond reading the Texas Register
every day to discovery merely theoretical threats to the well-being of their
community.
The only part of the public that could possibly be affected enough to
devote time and resources to monitoring and trying to influence the standard
permit while it was actually being developed-which is the only time the
state allows public involvement-was the affected trade and industry group.
In other words, the reality of the standard permit process in Texas is that the
public is excluded from the process-and this is by design, not happenstance.

MAx RENEA HICKS
ArrORNEY AT LAW
November 4, 2009
Page 4
Local citizens aren't affected when the permit is being developed, and they
are deemed to have complained too late when they actually are affected by a
years-later authorization for someone to operate under the permit developed
only in a room occupied by TCEQ and the interested industry.
To make the Catch-22 situation even worse, the Texas Legislature has
roped off the standard permit process itself from meaningful judicial review,
even in the unlikely event that someone other than the affected industry had
been far-sighted and resource-rich enough to have become involved and
concerned during the permit's development. So, not only is the practical
reality that the public is excluded from the standard permitting process; the
statutory rule is that such involvement would be rendered legally
meaningless anyway, because TCEQ has legally untrammeled freedom to
simplydisregard whatever facts the public might bring to bear on the matter.
Texas's standard permit process should be disapproved, and EPA
should require revision of Texas's SIP to remedy the current exclusion of
the public from involvement in development of standard permits
It is not entirely clear to the CCOC that the current process embraces
the issue it raises here about Texas's standard permitting process. If it does,
please take these comments into account, disapprove Texas's SIP insofar as
its standard permit rules are concerned, and require Texas to allow realistic,
meaningful and judiciallyreviewable citizen input into the standard permits
the state adopts. If it does not, please extend your inquiry to this topic, too.
The current situation constitutes a rigged shell game insofar as the public
and standard permits are concerned. What happened to CCOC, and what
TCEQ did, in the Asphalt Plant No.4 situation amply demonsttate this
reality.

Statement of the Nature of the Case

Statement of Facts
_
3
A. Asphalt Plant No.4 seeks authorization to operate, raising
environmental concerns of those nearby
3
B. TCEQ denies the opportunity for a formal public hearing
or contested case on the requested authorization for
Asphalt Plant No.4 to operate
5
C. TCEQ's industry-centered process for developing a standard
permit for asphalt plants supplants individualized hearings
6
D. TCEQ adopts the standard permit without discussion and
with bare-bones findings
8
E. The plaintiffs were first affected by TCEQ's adoption of the
standard permit when Asphalt Plant No.4 came to town
8
Points of Error and Argument
,
11
I. The standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants, as applied
in TCEQ's authorization for Asphalt Plant No.4, and the
Asphalt Plant No.4 authorization are invalid because the
standard permit is not supported by legally sufficient
findings
11
II. Ifthe TCEQ findings in support of the standard permit for
for hot mix asphalt plants are legally SUfficient, then Section
382. 1595(a) of the Clean Air Act is unconstitutional because
it violates the separation of powers requirement in Article II,
§ 1, of the Texas ConstitutiOn!
18
III. TCEQ's optional choice to develop and implement a standard
permit for hot mix asphalt plants violates the open courts
requirement in Article I, § 13, of the Texas Constitution

STATEMENT OF THE NATURE OF THE CASE
The
plaintiffs in
this case
challenge
the
action
of
the
Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (""TCEQ"") in authorizing operation
of a permanent hot mix asphalt plant located between Denison and
Pottsboro in Grayson County under TCEQ's air quality standard permit
for hot mix asphalt plants.
It is brought by a local organization of
concerned citizens, an adjacent affected city, and numerous individuals,
including a retired United States District Judge, and other entities
holding property adjacent to or near the asphalt plant.
The case does not come into Court from a contested case proceeding
under the Texas Administrative Procedure Act, TEX. Gov'r CODE ch. 2001
(""APA""),
Instead, the Court has jurisdiction under TEx, WATER CODE §
5.351{a} (authorizing affected persons to petition for review of TCEQ
actions) and TEx. HEALTH &
SAFETY CODE § 382.032(a) {authorizing
affected persons to appeal TCEQ actions into a Travis County district
court},
The parties have agreed to go to trial based. on stipulations,
These
stipulations consist of eight numbered stipulations,
two
stipulated
exhibits, and a two-volume stipulated administrative record.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

to
operate.
raising
environmental concerns of those nearby.
In
mid-January of 2007,
a
North Texae-baeed paving company
submitted an application to TCEQ to operate a new, permanent hot mix
asphalt plant near Denison, Texas.
AR 1:Tab
1.
This new plant
(sometimes referred to here as ""Asphalt Plant No.4"") would run day and
night, year-found and produce up to 300 tons an hour, and 250,000
tons per year, of asphalt. ld.
If authorized, the asphalt plant's operation would entail significant
emissions of pollutants into the air.
More than 9 tons a year of
particulate matter (more than half of which would be the smaller, more
dangerous particles of 10 microns across or less} would be released into
the air.
AR IrTab 11. Also emitted would be more than five tons a year
of volatile organic compounds, more than 8 tons a year of nitrous oxide,
nearly 10 tons a year of sulfur dioxide, and more than 18 tons a year of
carbon monoxide.
ld.
Included in the emissions would be such metal
and
organic
pollutants
as
arsenic,
chromium,
lead,
mercury,
fonnaldehyde, and benzene. AR I :Tab 1.
These facts, combined with Asphalt Plant No. 4's location, raised
widespread concern in the surrounding communities, particularly in the
3

nearby town of Pottsboro.r
The
City of Pottsboro, the Pottsboro
Independent School District,
and the
Pottsboro
Area
Chamber of
Commerce each passed formal resolutions in opposition to Plant No. 4's
operation in its self-designated location. AR I:Tabs 5, 6, & 15.
There also was an outpouring of public opposition from hundreds of
those living and operating businesses adjacent to or very near the
Asphalt Plant No.4 site.
AR I:Tabs 4 & 28.
More than 350 concerned
citizens met in a forum on the plant's proposed operation.
AR I:Tab 4.
Parents of children living nearby and attending one of the three public
schools within a mile of the plant site expressed their concern and hope
that the plant not be allowed to operate. ki. The owner of a farm raising
natural
foods
directly across the
highway
from
the
putative
site
expressed worry about what the plant's emissions would do to the
business, as well as to the health of her children.
Id. The impact of the
plant on a residential subdivision was highlighted.
Id. Also weighing in
with his concerns,was a local doctor who lives in Pottsboro. He identified
potential health effects from the expected pollutant emissions, including
impairments
for
elderly
patients with heart disease
from
carbon
monoxide, nitrous oxide damage to lung tissue, and other risks to such
vulnerable populations as young children. Id.
I Pottsboro's population in the 2000 census was 1,579.

B. TCEQ denies the opportunity for a formal public hearing or contested
case on the requested authorization for Asphalt Plant No.4 to operate.
This
public
outcry
came
to
naught,
both
substantively
and
procedurally. There was never a hearing at which the concerns could be
formally presented, subject to being either established or refuted as fact.
Instead, an official from TCEQ's Air Permits Division responded that
""[tjhere
is
no
public
notice
requirement
for
this
(Plant
No.4]
authorization and consequently no formal public comment process."" AR
I:Tab 4 (M. Gould e-mail of Jan. 31,2007).
This position was later
echoed by a TCEQ Deputy Director.
AR l:Tab 14.
Finally, TCEQ's
Executive Director informed the area's state senators that there would be
neither a public hearing nor a contested case proceeding in connection
with Plant No.4. AR I:Tab 8.
The Executive Director did authorize a ""public meeting,"" expressly
distinguished from
the
procedurally significant ""public hearing"" or
""contested case hearing"" processes, for the public to vent its views in a
meeting that was nothing more than ""informational,""
Id. (emphasis
added).
Four days after the meeting, TCEQ, through its Air Permits
Division, issued its formal authorization for Asphalt Plant No. 4 to
operate between Denison and Pottsboro.
AR I:Tab 11 [at Brief Appendix
TabA).3
2 The senator had requested that TCEQ conduct a public hearing. AR 1:Tab 7.
3 Rushing Paving Company, Ltd., received the original authorization for Asphalt
Plant No.4. AR l:Tabll. It since has been transferred to the current operator,
5

C. TCEQ's industry-centered process for developing a standard permit for
asphalt plants supplants individualized permit hearings.
The reason that the affected public's concerns fell on deaf ears at
TCEQ is that the agency previously had issued what is known as a
""standard permit"" for hot mix asphalt plants.
AR 2:Tab 58 (Air Quality
Standard Permit for Hot Mix Asphalt Plants). Under the standard permit
mechanism, those who wish to construct and operate hot mix asphalt
plants in the state have only to submit an application {officially termed a
""regtstration'j,""
affirming
that
they
meet
the
standard
permit's
parameters.
Mterwards, as a
matter of course, TCEQ issues the
applicant an authorization to operate under the permit-without any
mechanism or need for public notice or input.
See, e.g., AR l:Tab 17
(Deputy Director correspondence referencing -rute'f.e
The origins of the standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants in Texas
are in 2002 and 2003.
TCEQ staff began to evaluate switching the
process for permitting hot mix asphalt plants from the then-current
process that used' both permits-by-rule and regular air quality permits to
the standard permit format.
AR 2:Tab 37.

Division conducted so-called ""stakeholder""
meetings with the asphalt

particularly the Texas Asphalt Pavement Association, and, to a much
lesser extent, the Texas Department of Transportation.
AR 2:Tab 38-41
& 43-44.6
Agency staff also began air modeling, based on the express
assumption that such plants ""would be located in areas considered rural
for modeling purposes"" and using ""rural coefficients.""
AR 2:Tab 42
(emphasis added].""
In early 2003, TCEQ gave notice of its issuance concerning a draft
standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants, the opportunity for public
comment on it, and a public meeting in Austin to receive testimony on it.
AR 2:Tab 50. This public comment and hearing process was essentially
an industry-only affair. See AR 2:Tabs 51-53.8
TCEQ completed its work on the standard permit in early 2003, but
chose to wait until the legislative session ended to present it to TCEQ
Commissioners for consideration and adoption.
AR 2:55 (p. 4).
The
proposed standard permit was placed on the TCEQ Commissioners'
6 TCEQ staff later made clear that the stakeholder meeting was designed to be
only for asphalt operators.
AR 2:Tab 53 (p. 6). Ironically, one of the industry
representatives at the first of these meetings was from the same company,
Westward Environmental Services, Inc., which five years later prepared and
submitted the registration for Asphalt Plant No.4.
Compare AR I:Tab 1 with
AR 2:Tab 43 (lot page, last line).
7 Despite the statewide application of the program, the modelers limited their
use of surface meteorological data to Austin and the upper air data to Victoria,
all from a five-year period ending in 1988. AR 2:Tab 42.

AR 2:S7 (Addendum to Agenda, Item
60).
D. TCEQ adopts the standard permit without discussion and with bare-
bones findings.
At the hearing, an Air Permits Division staff member made a
truncated
presentation-less
than
five
minutes-of
the
proposed
standard permit. AR 2:C-2 (agenda tape). The Commissioners asked no
questions and made no substantive comments.
Stip. Exh. 2 (2-page

The standard permit was
unanimously adopted. Id.
The Commissioners made fmdings, which state, in their entirety:
In accordance with 30 TAC § 116.602, the commission finds
that
the
standard
permit
requires
best
available
control
technology, that the standard permit is enforceable, and that
the commission can adequately monitor compliance with the
terms of the standard permit.
AR 2:Tab 58 (dated July 9, 2003) [at Brief Appendix Tab C).
E. The plaintiffs were first affected by TCEQ's adoption of the standard
permit when Al!!phalt Plant No.4 came to town.
The City of Pottsboro and individuals living and owning property and
businesses near what several years later became Asphalt Plant No. 4
were not confronted with any real or potential asphalt plants when the
standard permit was being developed and adopted by TCEQ.
Stips. 3 &

The record reflects that there was effectively no
inooluement beyond the asphalt plant operators and, to a minor extent, the
Texas Department of Transportation.

When,
however, TCEQ first deployed the standard permit procedure in a way
directly affecting them, they challenged the TCEQ action, initially by
raising
the
previously-summarized
concerns
about the
prospective
authorization for Asphalt Plant No.4 and, then, when those efforts led to
nothing, by filing this lawsuit. 11
It is agreed that the plaintiffs are ""affected by operation of' Asphalt
Plant No.4.
Stip. 4.
The l Sn-member Concerned Citizens of Grayson
County includes those with special concerns about health matters in
connection with the plant, including concerns about their children who
will be attending public school near it.
Id.
The City of Pottsboro is
concerned not only about the effect of the plant on future growth and
10 In fact, the standard permit process as used by TCEQ is such that no
ordinary citizen or association of citizens could level a judicial challenge to
whether the standard permit was legally adopted.
Actual or eminent injury is
required to assert a justiciable interest sufficient to confer jurisdiction on a
court. See, e.g., Texas Disposal Systems Landfill, Inc. 1/. TCEQ, 259 S.W.3d 361,
363 [Tex.Appc--Amarillo 2008, no pet. h.]. ""[P]otentialities or events that 'may'
happen are insufficient to confer a justiciable interest in agency action.""
Id. at
363-64 (""like the chance of a pig growing wings, the purported injury ... is
mere speculation"" and the ""public's interest"" cannot be invoke to fill the
jurisdictional void). In all likelihood, TCEQ's standard permit process is best
seen as a guaranteed method for denying all but affected industries the ability
to raise a judicial challenge to far-reaching environmental actions by the state's
lead environmental agency.
11 The plaintiffs filed a ""Motion for Reconsideration or Rehearing and to
Overturn or, Alternatively a Variance"" {""Reconsideration Motion""] twenty-one
days after the Asphalt Plant No.4 authorization issued.
AR I:Tab 29.
The
Commission declined to act on the motion.

The plaintiffs filed
their original petition in this Court twenty-nine days after the issuance of the
authorization.

nearby resort and recreational facilities, but also about its effects on the
City's air quality and the health effects on vulnerable populations such
as the elderly and children.

Retired United States District Judge
Brown owns more than a hundred acres of property directly across from
the plant site, while other plaintiffs own and live on nearby property and
fear for their health and the devaluation of their property's value. Id.
All the plaintiffs come into this Court to raise the legal issue whether
TCEQ used legally sanctioned methods to authorize Asphalt Plant No. 4's
operation.

POINTS OF ERROR AND ARGUMENT
POINT OF ERROR No.1:
THE STANDARD PERMIT FOR HOT MIX ASPHALT PLANTS, AS APPLIED IN
TCEQ's AUTHORIZATION FOR ASPHALT PLANT No.4, AND THE ASPHALT
PLANT No. 4 AUTHORIZATION ARE INVALID BECAUSE THE STANDARD
PERMIT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY LEGALLY SUFFICIENT FINDINGS.
[See
Reconsideration Motion, Part V, at 6-8.t2
Texas administrative agencies have no inherent powers, and their
authority is not presumed. ""Rather, they may exercise only those powers
the law, in clear and express statutory language, confers upon them.""
Subaru of America, Inc. v. David McDavid Nissan, Inc., 84 S.W.3d 212,
220 (Tex. 2002).
The Texas Clean Air Act, TEx. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE ch. 382, is the
source of TCEQ's authority to
issue standard permits.
The basic
authorization is in Section 382.051(b)3) of the Clean Air Act, which
simply provides that TCEQ may issue ""a standard permit for similar
facilities.""
A standard permit is, essentially, a type of ""off-the-shelf""
permitting system for regulating emission of air pollutants in the state.
To establish and operate an air pollutant-emitting facility covered by a
1~ The requirement in Travis County District Court Ru1e IO.S.l(d) that a point of
error reference pertinent portions of the motion for rehearing at the agency is
inapplicable in this case.
TCEQ does not recognize a formal motion for
rehearing process for authorizations under standard permits.
See, e.g., AR
l:Tab 12 (2nd letter, March 12, 2007, from Air Permits Division Director to
Renea Hicks,
advising that judicial appeal deadline was
30 days from
authorization); see also 30 TEx. ADMIN. CODE § 116.605(g) (TCEQ announcing
that its issuance of a registration to use a standard permit is not subject to the
APA's
requirements).
Nonetheless,
the
plaintiffs
protectively
filed
a
reconsideration motion with TCEQ, and any points raised in that motion that
are raised here are cross-referenced.
11

TCEQ standard permit, the putative operator has only to submit a
completed application-technically, a ""registration""-and pay a modest
fee. In the Asphalt Plant NO.4 instance, Rushing Paving Company, Ltd.,
submitted a registration to TCEQ, paid a $900 registration fee, and
received authorization to operate.
AR I:Tab 1. The whole process took
less than two months.
The
legislature,
however,
imposed
explicit
requirements
which
constrain TCEQ's authority to use standard permits as a one-size-fits-all
method for authorizing the emission of pollutants.
Specifically, Section
382.05195(a) of the Clean Air Act authorizes TCEQ, in the event the
agency chooses» to take the standard permit route, to develop and issue
a standard permit for ""new or existing similar facilities"" in the state only
if TCEQ ""finds"" that:
(1) the standard permit is enforceable;
(2) the commission can adequately monitor compliance with the
terms of the standard permit; and
(3) ...(f]or permit applications filed after August 31, 2001, all
facilities permitted under this section will use control technology
at least as effective as that described in Section 382.0518{b).
TEx. HEALTH & SAFE1Y CODE § 382.05195(a}.t4
The general rules TCEQ
adopted under this standard permitting authority merely repeat verbatim
the first two of these legislative required findings and summarizes the
13 The legislature did not mandate the use of standard permits for air-polluting
facilities. It simply gave TCEQ the administrative option of going that route.

12
third requirement in even more cursory terms.
See 30 TEx. ADMIN. CODE
§ 116.602{a), (c) [at Brief Appendix Tab E).
TCEQ added nothing to this list of required findings when it adopted
the air quality standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants.
The
Commission's only findings under the Section 382.05195{a) mandate are:
In accordance with 30 TAC § 116.602, the commission finds that
the standard permit requires best available control technology,
that the standard permit is enforceable, and that the commission
can
adequately monitor
compliance with
the
terms of the
standard permit.
AR 2:Tab 58 (Order Issuing An Air Quality Standard Permit, July 9,
2003, 1st para., 2nd sent.).
The agency's mere parroting of the legislative directive in the findings
supporting issuance of the permit is legally insufficient under governing
principles of administrative law.
When an agency is statutorily directed
to make findings in connection with agency action, the agency may not
support the action with bare-bones recitation of the statutory language,
but, instead, must support the action with supporting statements of
underlying facts.
That did not happen here. Therefore, the standard
permit for hot mix asphalt plants is invalid and the authorization under
it for Asphalt Plant No.5 also is invalid.
As explained earlier in this brief,15 Section 382.032 of the Clean Air
Act provides the jurisdictional basis for this challenge to TCEQ's action. 16
15 See Statement of Nature of the Case, supra, at p. 2.
16 TEx. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.032 is at Brief Appendix Tab F.
13

The question in such an appeal is whether the agency action is ""invalid,
arbitrary, or unreasonable."" TEx. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.032(e}.
The Austin Court of Appeals considered this agency review provision
and gave it a crucial gloss in smith v. Houston Chemical Svcs., Inc., 872
S.W.2d 252 (Tex.App.-Austin 1994, writ withdrawn) [at Brief Appendix
Tab GJ.
This statutory gloss, necessitated by constitutional concerns,
trumps
the
Clean
Air
Act
provision
that
standard
permits
and
authorizations under them are not subject to the APA. See TEx. HEALTH
& SAFETY CODE § 382.05195(g).
To
protect
the
statute
from
potential
separation-of-powers
constitutional defecte.w the court of appeals determined that the same
judicial rules apply to Section 382.032 appeals as apply to more typical
administrative appeals under the APA.
Houston Chemical at 257 n.2.
The court in Houston Chemical, therefore, held that the ""entire scope"" of
APA review applies in appeals such as this one.
More recently, the
Austin Court of Appeals has reiterated Houston Chemical's holding on
this point, observing the ""unusual standard"" in Section 382.032 and, in
reliance on Houston Chemical, concluding that it imports the APA rules of
review into these kinds of Cases.
United Copper Indus., Inc. v. Grissom,
17 S.W.3d 797, 801 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, pet. rev. dism'dl.w
17 see Point of Error No.2, infra. at pp. 18-21.

otherwise governed by the APAis not unique to the Austin Court of Appeals and
its line of authority concerning Section 382.032. The Supreme Court of Texas

Guided by this reference to APA procedures, the legal shortcomings in
TCEQ's parroted findings for the asphalt plant standard permit are
glaringly obvious. The APA requires that agency fmdings, ""if set forth in
statutory language, must be accompanied by a concise and explicit
statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.""
TEX. Gov'r
CODE § 2001.141(d} (emphasis added).
Failure to set out the requisite
underlying facts invalidates the agency action.
See, e.g., Centerpoint
Energy Entex v. RRC, 213 S.W.3d 364, 370-71 (Tex.App.-Austin 2006,
pet. rev. dism'd) (fmding agency violation of APA Section 2001, 141(d)).
Judicial disapprobation of agency action supported by nothing more
than
agency
recitation
of
findings
which
merely
repeat
statutory
directives concerning such findings has been a mainstay of Texas
administrative law for quite some time.
In Lewis v. Gonzales County
Savings and Loan Ass'n, 474 S.W.2d 453 (Tex. 1972), the Supreme Court
invalidated agency action granting an application to operate a business
because the only supporting agency findings were set forth only in
statutory language.
474 S.W.2d at 457 [at Brief Appendix Tab HJ.
The
Court held that such fmdings were, insufficient standing alone, but had
to be ""accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying
facts supporting the findings.""
[d.
The policy underpinning this
requirement was expl.ained to be the need for the reviewing courts to
has taken a similar approach.
See Board of Law Examiners v: Stevens, 868
S.W.2d 773, 777 (Tex. 1994) (explaining that, although the APAdoes not govern
Board procedures, ""the APA sections addressing the scope of judicial review
under the substantial evidence rule are instructive"").
15

have some guide to measure how the agency decision-makers went about
exercising the discretion and judgment placed in their laps, at least in
the first instance, by the legislature. Id.
A little over a decade later, the Supreme Court re-emphasized the
requirement for agencies to buttress findings made in purely statutory
language with underlying findings to flesh out the factors going into the
statutory fmdings.
Citing Lewis, the Court in Texas Health Facilities
Comm'n v. Charter Medical-Dallas, Inc., 665 S.W.2d 446 (Tex. 1984), held
that the predecessor version of APA Section 2001.141(d) ""requires an
accompanying statement of underlying facts ... when the ultimate fact
finding embodies a mandatory fact finding set forth in the relevant
enabling act."" 665 S.W.2d at 451 [at Brief Appendix Tab I]. The Court
found this requirement of underlying facts to be ""more than a technical
prerequisite."" Id. at 451-52. It explains:
One purpose no doubt is to restrain any disposition on the part
of the [agency] to grant a certificate without a full consideration of
the evidence and a serious appraisal of the facts.
Another is to
inform
protestants
of
the
facts
found
so
that
they
may
intelligently prepare and present an appeal to the courts.
Still
another is
to assist the courts in
properly exercising their
function of reviewing the order.
665 S.W.2d at 452, quoting Miller v. RRC, 363 S.W.2d 244, 245-46 (Tex.
1962); see also United Resource Recovery, Inc. v. Texas Water Comm'n,
815 S.W.2d 797, 800 (Tex,App.-Austin 1994, writ denied) (stating same
underlying principles),
16
TCEQ's bare-bones repetition of the findings required by Section
382.05195(a) violates both the technical requirements applicable to the
agency and the more basic principles guiding the technical requirement.
It is particularly troubling to have such an agency shortcoming in an
action as far-reaching as a standard permit.
This is not a one-time
action, directed at a single facility and site.
Instead, a standard permit
reaches far into the future and across the entire state, making the need
for supportive, underlying findings particularly acute. Asphalt Plant No.
4, for example, involves the applicability of a permit based on modeling
for rural areas and keyed to air movements in locales (Austin and
Victoria) hundreds of miles to the south.
Asphalt Plant No. 4 is in a
rapidly transitioning area,
with residential subdivisions and public
schools nearby, a far cry from the ""rural"" area basis for the model for the
permit.
There is nothing in the findings of the Commissioners making
the 2003 permit decision remotely suggesting that they gave attention to,
or were even aware of, the ramifications of their actions for future plants
in different locations.
The absence of any underlying agency findings, beyond rote repetition
of the statutory directive about findings, renders the permitting decision
creating the standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants invalid and,
consequently, the issuance of the authorization for Plant No, 4 to operate
under that permit also invalid,
Therefore, the challenged agency action
should be reversed,
17

POINT OF ERROR No. II:
IF THE TCEQ FINDINGS IN SUPPORT OF THE STANDARD PERMIT FOR HOT
MIX
ASPHALT
PLANTS
ARE
LEGALLY
SUFFICIENT,
THEN
SECTION
382.1595(a) OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT IS UNCONSITUTlONAL BECAUSE IT
VIOLATES THE SEPARATION OF POWERS REQUIREMENTIN ARTICLE II, § 1,
OF THE TEXAS CONSTITUTION.
[See Reconsideration Motion, at 7
n.8.]
It is elementary that the power to pass laws rests with the legislature
and cannot be delegated to some other tribunal. Brown u. Humble Oil &
Refining Co., 83 S.W.2d 935, 941
(Tex. 1935).
Still,
the modern
administrative state is well-established, and agencies are given enormous
powers. There are checks, though.
Under Texas's separation of powers requirement, the legislature, in
exercising
its
authority
to
delegate
government
police
powers
to
administrative agencies in
the executive branch of government,
is
required to establish ""reasonable standards"" to guide the agencies in
their exercise of such powers.
See, e.q., RRC u. Lone star Gas Co., 844
S.W.2d 679, 689 (Tex. 1992); see also Edgewood ISD v. Meno, 917
S.W.2d 717, 740 ·~Tex. 1995) (same). If Section 382.1595(a) is construed
to require no more of TCEQ than a mere recitation of statutory language
in making findings in support of a standard permit, then the legislative
delegation
is
unconstitutional
for
failure
to
set
any
""reasonable
standards"" for TCEQ's actions.
If they require TCEQ to do no more than chant the legislative mantra,
the preamble and Subsections (1) and (2) of Section 382.05195(a) provide
no guidance or control over the actions of TCEQ. The legislature directs
18
that standard permits may only be issued for ""similar facilities.""
TCEQ
may no finding at all in the asphalt plant standard permit concerning
this requirement.
Its order issuing the permit says nothing about what
makes every asphalt plant in the state ""similar"" to every other one
beyond the fact that they are all asphalt plants.
Yet, atmospheric
conditions across the state vary tremendously, as do population densities
and land use.
Standing alone, the legislative directive about ""similar
facilities"" provides no meaningful or reasonable guidance to TCEQ-and
the TCEQ commissioners made no express determination that fleshes
out the meaning and reach of the phrase in concrete ways.
The legislative directive that TCEQ may not issue a standard permit
for ""similar facilities"" without a contemporaneous finding that the permit
being issued is ""enforceable"" is meaningless without agency elucidation.
The
agency's general rules for standard permits provide no
such
elucidation.
They merely repeat that the permit be ""enforceable.""
30
TEx. ADMIN. CODE § 116.602{a){I). The Commissioners' order issuing the
standard permit for asphalt plants adds nothing either, repeating only
that it is ""enforceable."" AR 2:Tab 58. 19
19 The public meeting TCEQ deigned to give local concerned citizens on the eve
of issuance of the Plant No.4 authorization gives the only sense of what TCEQ
staff thought ""enforceable"" means in this context.
There, the staff told the
audience that, because of inadequate staffing, the public itself had to be TCEQ's
""eyes and ears.""
AR 2:C-l (Tape of March 8, 2007, informational meeting).
[Before trial and argument in this matter, counsel for the plaintiffs will endeavor
to confirm whether this TCEQstatement made its way onto the tape that is in the
record, which captured only 48 minutes ofaudible statements at the meeting.j
19

The statutory mandate that any permit be ""enforceable"" is empty
without a requirement of underlying findings or rules explaining what it
means in the context of these cff-the-ehelf authorizations to issue a given
level of air pollutants in a community. As the Supreme Court explained
in striking down an insufficient legislative delegation to a state agency,
""the legislature may not delegate its powers without providing some
criteria and safeguards.""
Texas Antiquities Comm.
lJ. Dallas County
Community College Dist., 554 S.W.2d 924, 927 (Tex. 1977) (emphasis
added).
Administrative safeguards in the form of agency rules can be a
substitute method, beyond clearer legislative directives, for protecting the
need for some measurable standards for agencies and the citizens
affected by their actions.
[d. at 928 {citing Davis, ADMINISTRATIVE LAw
TREATISE § 2.16 (Iat ed.
1970).
But, the rules in this instance add
nothing protective or explanatory.
The
same problem presents itself in the second of the required
findings under Section 382.1595{a), mandating a finding that TCEQ can
""adequately monitor compliance"" with the permit's terms.
Again, the
agency rules simply repeat the statutory language, as does the order
issuing the standard permit.
30 TEx. ADMIN. CODE § 116.602 (a)(2); AR
2:Tab 58.
Absent agency gap-filling through rules or
findings of
underlying fact, this also reduces itself to a standardless legislative
requirement.
20
For these reasons, if the Court rejects Point of Error No. I, it should
determine that Section 382.05195(a) violates TEx. CONST. Art. I, § 2 and
that, therefore, the standard permit for asphalt plants issued under the
statute is invalid, as is the authorization for Asphalt Plant No. 4 to
operate under the standard permit.
POINT OF ERROR No. III:
TCEQ's OPTIONAL CHOICE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A STANDARD
PERMIT FOR HOT MIX ASPHALT PLANTS VIOLATES THE OPEN COURTS
REQUIREMENTIN ARTICLE I, § 13, OF lHE TEXAS CONSTITUTION.
The
legislature did not mandate that TCEQ develop and issue a
standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants.
The choice was TCEQ's,
which could have opted to use an individualized permitting system. The
manner in which TCEQ chose to exercise this option effectively froze out
affected third parties such as the plaintiffs in this case from
the
permitting process, while allowing the industry side of the equation to
give full vent to its concerns and interests during the process of issuing
the permit and, should it have come to it, in seeking judicial review
afterwards (in the highly unlikely event that the industry side would have
been disapproving of the very permit it was given such a role in forming).
TCEQ made things even more one-aided in terms of the opportunity
for judicial review when it promulgated its general rules for the standard
permitting process. The agency tried to keep the APA out of the process
insofar as citizen input and rights were concerned, but it expressly
imported the
APA into the process insofar as industry rights are
21

concerned.
In Section 116.601(b} of TCEQ's rules for standard permits,
Equal access to the judicial system has been a long-established
the agency dictated that standard permits ""remain in effect ... until . . .
component
of the
constitutional
rule
requiring
open
courts.
In
repealed under the APA.""
30 TEx. ADMIN, CODE § 116.601(b) (1st sent.)
(emphasis added).
In other words, TCEQ has chosen to adopt two different standards for
the opportunity of those affected by its standard permitting decision for
hot mix asphalt plants to seek judicial review of TCEQ actions.
The
industry, which always will have a present and justiciable interest in the
standard permits affecting it, will be able to challenge TCEQ actions in
court.
Citizens in the shoes of the plaintiffs in this case, however, will
not.
As previously discussed, the rules for finding a justiciable interest
sufficient
to
seek judicial
relief in
Texas courts
will
preclude
a
contemporaneous citizen challenge to the standard permit decision of the
agency,
See p. 9, fn. 10, supra (citing Texas Disposal Systems Landfill,
Inc.
I). TCEQ).
This is, effectiyely, an indefinite postponement of the opportunity for
citizen challenges in court to TCEQ's issuance of standard permits.
Similar
indefinite
deferments
of the opportunity that is
otherwise
available for judicial review have been found to violate the open courts
provision of the Texas Constitution.
See Gebhardt
I). Gallardo, 891
S,W.2d
327,
332
(Tex.App.-San
Antonio
1995)
(orig.
proceeding)
(abating a
case indefinitely has been found to violate open courts
requirements) .
22
Dillingham I). Putnam, 109 Tex. 1, 14 S,W. 303 (1890) [at Brief Appendix
Tab JI,the Court struck down as violative of open courts a statute which
established a differential bond requirement for access to the courts. The
Court explained that Article I, § 13, of the Texas Constitution ""applies to
a defendant as well as a plaintiff"" and pointedly concluded:
A law which practically takes away from either party to litigation
the right to a fair and impartial trial in the courts provided by the
constitution for the determination of a given controversy, denies a
remedy by due course of law.
Dillingham, 14 S.W. at 304, cited in R Communications, Inc.
I). Sharp, 875
S.W.2d 314,315 (Tex. 1994).
These open courts principles are violated by TCEQ's differential
approach to its decision-making for standard permits.w State agencies
are not authorized to establish and operate a system of administration
which effectively forecloses the affected citizenry's opportunity to seek
judicial review of agency actions while leaving affected industry's right to
seekjudicial review of those same actions unimpeded.
20 To the extent the Court does not find in the open courts provision of the
Texas Constitution an equal judicial access component, as urged in the text,
the plaintiffs would argue that the same disparate treatment violates the equal
protection constitutional requirement in TEx. CONSI'. Art. I, § 3, the due course
of law constitutional requirement in TEx. CONST. Art. I, § 19, and the right to
seek redress in the courts in TEX. CONST. Art, I, § 27.
23

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
The Court should reverse TCEQ's authorization of March 12, 2007,
for Asphalt Plant No.4 to operate because:
(al TCEQ's standard permit
for hot mix asphalt plants was illegally issued; or, alternatively, (b) TEx.
HEALTH AND SAFElY CODE §§ 382.051(b)(3) and 382.05195{a) violate the
separation of powers requirement of Article II, §
1, of the Texas
Constitution.
Consequently, the Court should remand this matter to
TCEQ for further proceedings consistent with the Court's ruling.

The standard permit approachto regulation'[ simplifies and accelerates the TCEQ
process under which fuel-burning productive facilities may become entitled to emit air
contaminants under tightly controlled conditions. An individual air emission permit
application,tailoredto a particular site, would undergo case-by-casetechnical review and
therefore would take more timeto be consideredand acted upont;han an applicationto use
a standard permit. The legislativepolicy was to allow qualifyingapplicants-
ones who
would agree to abide by fixed conditions-
morepromptlyto get productivebutrelatively
low-emissionfacilities on-line when and where they are needed.
The HMAP standardpermit applies to HMAPswith asphaltproduction rates of not
morethan 400tons per hour.g The one-size-fits-alldocumentwas crafted in 2003to ensure
that theair emissionscontrolcriteriaset forthin it includeamandate to Installbest available

In reviewing aparticular applicationfor an authorizationto use the HMAP standard

Plaintiffs' suitpresents itselfas atimely2007 challengeto a 2007TCEQorder. But
in fact, all of the briefed arguments attacka 2003 Order, while invokingjudicial-review-

statute indeedto enumerateeven a fair samplingof the possible points of similarityamong

job well, and its success easily preservedconstitutionality.
The plaintiffs accuse the agency of having shirked a supposed duty to make
underlying findingsabout enforceability,compliancemonitoring,and control technology.
The charge rests upon their apparent belief that the TCEQ's Order issuing the standard
permit wasjust one page long and did not elaboratebeyond statingthatthe permitmustuse
best available control technology, be enforceable, and monitorableby the TCEQ.4S This
belief. which seemscentralto their argument,is incorrect The Order actuallyconsistsof a

draftedwith specificitythat will allowthe TCEQto detect(and,ifnecessary,proveup in a
contested case hearing or a court enforcement case) if a permittee operates outside the
standard permit's limitations. To ensure its enforceability,the standard permit includes
record keeping andreportingrequirements. There are twopages of samplingrequirements
in paragraph (2) of the standardpermit 4ll and nearlya page of recordkeepingrequirements
in paragraph (1)(W).49 The TCEQexplained on page 10of24, in the Order's responseto
comments section, that it bad added to the proposed standard permit a record keeping
requirementfor startand stop timesof the truck load-out,mixproductionandsilo:Iilling ""to

for taxation ofall costs against the plaintiffs.

REPLYBRIEF
The plaintiffs-sometimes termed here the Grayson neighbors for
economy of reference-s-reply to TCEQ's merits brief.
I.
INTRODUCTION
""The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep
under bridges, beg in the streets or steal bread."" A. France, The Red Lily,
ch. 7 (1894). Such is TCEQ's core defense of the ""standard permit""
process for Texas hot mix. asphalt plants and its obscure, but carefully
crafted,
exclusion
of
affected
neighbors
from
any
substantively
meaningful participation in either the so-called ""legislative"" process at
the agency or the ensuing judicial process for situating 24-hour-a-day-,
365-days-a-year pollution-emitting asphalt plants in their midst.a
l These neighbors of Asphalt Plant NO.4 include families living nearby or with children
attending nearby public schools, adjoining landowners such as retired federal Judge
Brown, the City of Pottsboro, and individual members of the Concerned Citizens of
Grayson County.
2 TCEQ itself provides a curious litany of the ironic equalities in the standard permit
process.
eThe exclusionary and insular nature of the standard permit process-which was
a near-exclusive industry affair, eeoc Br. 7-was not the result of legislative
dwire, not nefarious TCEQ scheming. TCEQ Br. 17. Yes, the Grayson neighbors
largely agree. This situation results more from legislative design than anything,
but TCEQ was not forced to use the standard permit process. The legislature
only made it a TCEQ option.
eNo one was frozen out, because no one had a right to be there in the first place.
TCEQ Br. 17. This suggests that industry found the way into the process
through state efforts and assistance.
eTCEQ was solicitous of comments, without discrimination. TCEQ Br. 17. It just
so happens that, but for the single comment highlighted in footnote 60, all the
comments were from industry-side interests. Since the industry had been the
dominant, if not exclusive, presence in the stakeholder meeting leading to the
proposed standard permit, it is no surprise that some later comments from
industry were not adopted.
Contrary to TCEQ's arguments, neither Texas administrative law nor
the Texas Constitution compels judicial acceptance of such a one-sided
system of environmental regulation. TCEQ is wrong to tell the Court that
the Legislature is ""the only ... arbiter regarding what opportunities must
be provtdedl]"" those affected by government action, insofar as legal
redress is concerned. TCEQ Br. 16. It is well-established the courts have
an important role, too.
II.
THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE GRAYSON NEIGHBORS' CHALLENGE.
Without citation to case authority and with no quotes from any
statute, TCEQ argues that the Grayson neighbors had only thirty days
after TCEQ's July 2003 order adopting a standard permit for hot mix
asphalt plants to challenge the permit's legal validity.
TCEQ Br.
18.
According to TCEQ, the neighbors waited too long to sue by waiting until
TCEQ actions in implementing the 2003 permit first actually affected
them in a judicially cognizable way. TCEQ Br. 4-5 (stating that 30-day
limitations period had ""long since run out""}.
Fundamentally, TCEQ rests this jurisdictional argument on a simple,
but misleading, twist in the characterization of the Grayson neighbors'
e""[A[U received exacUy the same"" time and opportunity to comment in writing or
orally. TCEQ Br. 17-18. Again, this is true, but just a tad myopic. Industry's
palpable
financial
incentives
compared
with
the
public's
uncertain
and
indeterminate interest could have, and did have, only one result: industry totally
dominated ""public' involvement in development of the standard permit. The very
design of the legislation and the standard permit process realistically yield no
other outcome-which is a core problem with the process's design (which is to
say, a core problem with the legislation creating the process and giving TCEQ
the option to pursue it).
2

legal
challenge.
TCEQ's
characterization
is
that this
is
""a
2007
procedural challenge to its 2003 TCEQ Order."" TCEQ Sr. 6 n.13. The
neighbors' pleadings show the precise opposite: this is a challenge to
TCEQ's 2007 local implementation of a 2003 procedural permitting
order. As stated at the outset of the plaintiffs'live pleading, ""[t)he TCEQ
action challenged here is the application of TCEQ's [hot mix asphalt plant
standard permit]"" to an individual request for authorization to operate
under the permit near Pottsboro. Plaintiffs' Third Am. Orig. Pet. ,. 1 (2nd
para.) (emphasis added). The first item of requested relief is a declaratory
judgment that the 2007 authorization to operate Plant No.4 under the
2003 permit is invalid. [d. '[ 20.a. Consistent with these assertions, the
neighbors' brief opens with the explanation that the challenge is to
TCEQ's action in authorizing operation of Plant No.4 under the standard
permit. CCOC Br. 2.
The plain words of the relevant jurisdictional statutes directly rebut
TCEQ's argument, Under these statutes, not just anyone is authorized to
challenge TCEQ actions. Instead, it must be ""(a) person affected by a
ruling, order, or decision"" of TCEQ.
TEx. WATER CODE § 5.351(a)
{emphasis added}, The other jurisdictional statute is to exactly the same
effect, authorizing only ""[a} person affected by a ruling, order, decision,
or other act"" to appeal to district court. TEx. HEALTH & SAFElY CODE §
382,032(a) (emphasis added}.
3
The 2003 standard permit did not ""affect"" the Grayson neighbors
within a thirty day period after its July 9 th adoption by the TCEQ
commissioners. At that time, there was no hot mix asphalt plant on the
drawing boards for Grayson County, and the only hot mix asphalt plant
in existence already had an individualized permit, operative before, and
independent of, the 2003 standard permit for such plants. Stip. 3. The
Grayson neighbors, therefore, had no concrete reason or basis for
complaining about the standard permit when TCEQ issued it.
TCEQ indirectly makes the neighbors' jurisdictional point for them.
Toward the end of its brief, TCEQ lobs an impertinent accusation of
""environmental complacency"" at the Grayson neighbors for their non-
involvement in the 2003 administrative development of the standard
permit. TCEQ Sr.
18~19 n.63. The launching pad for this accusation is
that the Sherman asphalt plant already existed a few miles away. But, as
TCEQ has stipulated, the Sherman asphalt is not subject to the standard
permit process. It had its own individualized, site-specific permit. Stip. 3
(4th sent.]."" Invalidation of the standard permit process for Plant No.4,
then, would put Plant No, 4 on the same footing, permitting-wise, as
Plant No, 3: it would need to obtain a site-specific permits-c-which, in
turn, would allow the Grayson neighbors to make their case that the
3 Only about 22% of the state's hot mix asphalt plants operate under the standard
permit, Stip. 7.
4 Even with the standard permit in place, those seeking to operate hot mix asphalt
plants remain free to go the site-specific, individualized application route. ""Any hot mix
asphalt producing facility may continue to apply for an air quality permit under 30 TAe
§ 116.111.-AR 2:58, at p. 2 of pubfiehed comments.
4

specific site for Plant No. 4 is the wrong place for such an operation.
They were never given such an opportunity under the ""standard permit-
registration & authorization"" regime TCEQ defends.
The 2003 standard permit first ""stung"" the Grayson neighbors in
2007 when TCEQ authorized Plant No.4 to operate under it. Until then,
it was at best an inchoate, theoretical concern to them, and they would
have
been asking the courts to
act beyond
their
subject matter
jurisdiction if they had sought judicial relief affecting the 2003 permit
any
earlier.5
The
as-applied nature
of
this
challenge
is
akin
to
administrative permit proceedings in
which a
promulgated rule is
challenged in the context of its application in the circumstances of the
permit action. The basic rule in such circumstances has long been that a
time
limit
on
challenges
to
rules
does
not
foreclose
subsequent
examination of a rule when properly brought before court for review of
later agency action applying it. See Functional Music, Inc. v. FCC, 274
F.2d 543, 546 (D,.~. Cir. 1958), ceet. denied, 361 U.S. 813 (1959).
There is no jurisdictional bar to the Grayson neighbors challenging
the 2007 TCEQ authorization and, as part of the challenge, asserting
that the authorization was illegal because it rests on an invalid permit.
5 TCEQ makes a hedged suggestion that maybe the neighbors would have had standing
in 2003 to challenge the standard permit, even though there is zero evidence it affected
them either then or in the next four years. TCEQ Sr. 20 n.66. This borders on the
preposterous and comfortably inside the
""dead wrong"" category.
See,
e.g., Texas
Disposal Systems, Landfill, Inc. u. TCEQ, 259 S.W.3d 361, 363 (Tex.App.-Amarillo
2008, no pet.] (speculation and ""public interest"" are insufficient for jurisdiction).
5
TCEQ identifies no cases holding otherwise, and the two statutes it cites
directly support the Grayson neighbors, not TCEQ.

CONSTITUTIONAL NECESSITY,

lHE
REQUIREMENT DF
UNDERLYING FINDINGS, AND THE TCEQ COMMISSIONERS DID NOT MAKE THE
REQUISITE UNDERLYING FINDINGS IN THE ORDER ADOPTING THE STANDARD PERMIT
FOR HOTMIX ASPHALT PLANTS.
TCEQ argues that the APA's ""underlying facts"" requirement does not
apply, TCEQ Br. 6-9, and that, even if it does, TCEQ found sufficient
underlying facts, TCEQ Br. 13-15. Case law refutes the first point, and
the record refutes the second one.
A. The APA's
""underlying
facts""
requirement
applies
under
governing case law.
TCEQ assails the Grayson neighbors' argument about an absence of
underlying facts by asserting the syllogism that: (a) the ""underlying facts""
requirement derives from the APA, TEx. Gov'r CODE § 200LI41(d); and
(b) the legislature expressly made the APA inapplicable to the standard
permitting process., TCEQ Br. 6-7. The second point is undoubtedly
correct, as the plaintiffs themselves have acknowledged. CCGC Br. 14
(citing TEx. HEALTH & SAFE1Y CODE§382.05195(g)).
TCEQ's first point, though, is where its argument founders. The
jurisdictional vehicle for this case is TEx. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §
382.032. Subsection (e) of this statute sets the standard of review to be
whether TCEQ's action {issuance of the authorization for Plant No.4 to
operate
under
the
standard
permit)
is
""invalid,
arbitrary,
or
unreasonable."" The Austin Court ,.of Appeals has held that, in order to
6

avoid constitutional defects, this provision-which is indisputably the
jurisdictional source for this case-must be construed to import the APA
procedures in their entirety into cases brought into court through
Section 382.032. Smith v. Houston Chemical Sves., Inc., 872 S.W.2d 252,
at 252n.2 (Tex.App.-Austin 1994,
writ withdrawn);
United Copper
Indus"" Inc. v. Grissom, 17 S.W.3d 797,801 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, pet.
rev. dism'd) (citing Houston Chemical as importing APA procedures and
requirements into Section 382.032 appeals).
Stated another way, under Austin Court of Appeals case law, the
""underlying facts"" requirement of the APA, along with other APA
procedures, is imported into this case out of constitutional necessity in
order to save Section 382.032.6 The legislature did not make Section
382.032 inapplicable to
standard permit processes. Thus, because
constitutional requirements trump statutory rules where they are in
conflict, whatever the legislature did with the APA in subsection (g) of
Section
382.051~.5 is overridden by the necessary constitutional gloss
placed on Section 382.032. And, that reading of the statute requires that
the APA procedures, which include the requirement for underlying facts,
be applied to TCEQ's adoption of the standard permit for hot mix asphalt
plants.
TCEQ tries to distinguish the key case, Houston Chemical, on the
ground that it arose from a contested case proceeding, while this case
6 If possible, courts are to interpret statutory language in a manner that makes it
constitutional. City ofHouston. lJ. Clark, 197 S.W.3d 314, 320 (Tex. 2006).
7
did not. TCEQ Br.
7~8. But, the Houston Chemical decision's ruling on
the constitutionally-driven importation of APA procedures into Section
382.032{ej-based administrative appeals has nothing to do with whether
the case in front of the court arose from a contested case at the
administrative level. This part of the ruling focuses only on subsection (e)
and what it must be read to require in terms of administrative action as
the case comes into the judicial system. If accepted, TCEQ's explanation
of the decision's rationale-that it declared ""nothing more than that APA
appeal provisions apply to appeals of agency decisions made pursuant to
the APA"", TCEQ Br. 7 (emphasis in original)-would turn this part of the
Houston Chemical decision into nothing but an empty gesture. That is,
TCEQ's
proffered
reading
of
Houston
Chemical's
footnote
2
pronouncement is that it announces nothing more than that the APA
applies if the APA applies. This interpretation would turn Houston
Chemical's decision on this point into a meaningless statement and is
wrong on a straightforward reading of what the Court actually says in
the decision.
TCEQ dismisses the applicability of United Copper in a similarly
misguided way. TCEQ Br. 8 (arguing United Copper's inapplicability
because it dealt with a standard of review in the appeal of a contested
case proceeding). But, whatever the accuracy of this characterization,
United Copper plainly states that, under Houston Chemical, the APA
scope
of
review-which
carries
with
it
the
""underlying
facts""
8

requirement-applies to Section 382.032 appeals. 17 S.W.3d at 801. The
decision says nothing about limiting this principle only to appeals from
APAcontested cases (which would have been a meaningless tautology in
any event).
Houston
Chemical admittedly
is
key
to
the
Grayson neighbors'
""underlying facts"" argument. Its rule is clear and carries substantive
meaning. The APA procedures are imported into this case through
Section 382.032, as interpreted by
Houston Chemical.
Hence, the
""underlying facts"" rule applies.
B. The TCEQ Commissioners did not make the requisite findings of
underlying facts
when
adopting the
hot mix asphalt plant
standard permit
TCEQ argues that, even if underlying facts are required to flesh out
the bare-bones statutory findings? in the Commissioners' July 9, 2003,
order,
TCEQ
nonetheless made them
by
incorporating ""a lengthy
narrative and a comments-and-responses section that more than amply
served the functi~n of formal findings."" TCEQ Br. 9. TCEQ later surveys
the introductory narrative, the response to comments, and the text of the
permit itself and pronounces them sufficient for underlying findings.
TCEQ Br. 13-15.
TCEQ confuses specific recitations of requirements and rules with fad
findings' about why or
how those recitations support the requisite
7 Recall that the underlying facts must buttress three categories of required statutory
findings; (il enforceability; (ii) monitoring for compliance; and (ill) use of best available
control technology.
9
statutory findings. Reciting a requirement or rule is not the same as
providing a finding about why or how the requirement or rule factually
supports one of the statutory requirements. The underlying fact finding
is what is required to link the administrative requirement with the
statutory requirement. It lies between these two requirements and is
necessary in the administrative law context to validate the administrative
action.
1.
Essential requirements of underlying findings
It may be that the law imposes no rigid and precise form for how or
where an agency must state or locate its requisite underlying findings.
TCEQ Br. 9
& n.28 (citing two cases).
See,
e.g.,
United Resource
Recovery, Inc. v. Texas Water Comm'n, 815 S.W.2d 797, 800(Tex.App.-
Austin 1991, writ denied) (""no precise form in which an agency must
articulate its underlying findings""). But, the problem for TCEQ in this
case is not how or where it made such findings; instead, it is whether it
made them.
To understand why the ""Proposed Air Quality Standard Permit for Hot
Mix Asphalt Plants"" does not contain the necessary flndings.e it is
important to have in mind the policy underpinnings for requiring such
findings in the first place. The courts require them as part of their
judicial review function in the administrative law context ""to ensure a
a lf underlying findings are to be discovered, this document is the only possible place to
find them. The Commissioners' Order itself did nothing but recite the statutory findings.
TCEQ points to nothing else in the record mat would contain underlying findings.
10

serious appraisal of the facts by an agency."" United Resource, 815 S.W.2d
at 800,9 Evidence of such an agency appraisal is necessary because of
the uncomfortable, uncertain, but by now functionally unavoidable, fit of
administrative agencies into the three branches of government and the
exceptional deference the judiciary must give to agency fact findings.
Without the agency accountability that comes with the underlying
findings,
fundamental
separation
of
powers
principles
would
be
threatened.
The leading Texas case on underlying fact findings in administrative
proceedings, Texas Health Facilities Comm'n u. Charter Medical-DaUas,
Inc., 665 S.W.2d 446 (Tex. 1984), details the requirements for valid
underlying facts:
(a) they may not be presumed from findings of a
""conclusional nature;"" (b) they must be capable of being judicially read as
fairly and reasonably supporting the required criteria; (c) they should be
""clear, specific, [and] non-conclusory:"" (d) they are not to be mere recitals
to testimony or summations of the evidence; and (el they should ""relate
to material basic facts ... and to the ultimate statutory finding that they
accompany."" 665 S.W.2d at 451-52. They also must show ""the basis for
9 The Austin Court of Appeals recently repeated a fuller exposition of the rationale for
courts to require administrative agencies to provide underlying fact findings:
The purposes in requiring underlying facts are to require a full consideration of
the evidence and serious appraisal of the facts on the part of the administrative
agency;
to inform
the
[appellants] of the
facts
found
so that they
may
intelligently prepare and present an appeal to the courts; and to assist the

2.
The absence of necessary underlying findings for the
standardpermit
At pages 15 and 16 of its brief, TCEQ tries to glean the necessary
underlying findings
from
the
agency's statements
in
its
proposed
standard permit.
However,
of the three ultimate findings requiring
underlying findings-enforceability, compliance monitoring, and best
available control technology {""BACT""I-TCEQ points to not a single
underlying finding on one of them (monitoring) and to only a single item
on one aspect of another Icompliancej.u
The
underlying finding on
monitoring required
through
Section
382.05195(a){2) is simply not anywhere to be found, and TCEQ identifies
none.
This vacuum is not surprising since TCEQ officials conceded at
the otherwise meaningless public meeting held shortly before issuance of
the Plant No.4 authorization that the standard permit effectively has no
monitoring function. 12
10 The underlying findings do not have to reflect fact findings rejected by the agency in
reaching its decision. United Resource, supra, 815 S.W.2d at 800.
U The BACTrequirement appears to be satisfied. See TCEQ Sr. 16 (l·t para.).
12 At the public meeting, one of the concerned members of the public asked TCEQ
officials ""Who is going to do the monitoring?"" One TCEQ official noted that the permit
has requirements that are supposed to be complied with and said that ""the idea is that
if he [Plant No. 4's operator] monitors his equipment ..."" He then said: ""Is he self-
monitored? Yes, he's self-TrWnitored."" A second TCEQ official stepped in to explain: ""The
agency, especially the regional office, depends on you all to help be the eyes and ears.""
In other words, the only identified monitoring is either self-monitoring by the plant
operator or the public.
12

As to any underlying finding on the compliance required through
Section 382.05195(a)(I), TCEQ points primarily to requirements in the
standard permit itself. TCEQ Br. 14. But, these are not fact findings that
support what is being required. They are the requirement itself, and it
finds .no factual underpinning in the agency's spare explanation of how it
ended up with the permit's requirement.
TCEQ does identify one-and only one-isolated TCEQ explanation
that might generously be characterized as an underlying finding on
compliance. TCEQ Br. 14 (1st full para., last sentence). But, that single
""underlying fmding"" concerns only a minor element of plant operation
dealing with ""truck load-out"" Broader concerns about compliance in the
plant's principal operations are not even mentioned.
Thus,
after scouring the only document that might conceivably
contain
supportive
underlying
findings
for
the
statutory
ultimate
findings,
TCEQ has found nothing supporting one of the ultimate
findings and, at .,!>est, only one item supporting a narrow side-part of
another ultimate finding. In short, the requisite underlying findings are
not present, and the standard permit is invalid.
IV. IF
IT IS REACHED, lHE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
DELEGATION
ISSUE SHOULD BE
RESOLVED IN THE GRAYSON NEIGHBORS' FAVOR BECAUSE, OTHERWISE, THE
AGENCY IS
AUTHORIZED
TO ACT LEGISLATIVELY WllHOUT
ANY MEANINGFUL
CONSTRAINTS OR GUIDANCEFROMlHE TEXAS LEGISLATURE.
If the Court determines that the required underlying findings for the
standard permit are absent, see Part IILB.2, above, it need not reach the
issue of whether the legislature's delegation to TCEQ of the optional job
13
of developing and supporting a standard permit for hot mix asphalt
plants is constitutional. TCEQ's defense on this constitutional ground is
itself linked directly to its defense on the ""underlying findings"" issue.
TCEQ Br. 10-15 (Part II).
In this part of its argument, TCEQ mis-states the holding of a leading
case (getting it exactly backwards) and engages in a hyper-technical
criticism of the neighbors' reliance on another leading case-a criticism
at odds with later Supreme Court characterizations of that case. TCEQ
represents that the Supreme Court ""upheld a delegation"" to the private
entity in
Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation v. Lewellen, 952
S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1997). TCEQ Br.
15 n.52. Boll Weevil, in fact, did
precisely the opposite. It struck down a legislative act as an ""overly broad
delegation of legislative authority,"" concluding that the act ""cannot
stand."" 952 S.W.2d at 475.
TCEQ also criticizes the neighbors' reliance on Texas Antiquities
Comm. v. Dallas County Community College Dist., 554 S.W.2d 924 (Tex.
1977), for its Article II, § 1, constitutional argument. TCEQ Br. 11. It
asserts that the
plurality
decision
was
not based
on
the Texas
Constitution's separation of powers provision. Id. But, later decisions of
the
Supreme
Court
and
the
Austin
Court
of
Appeals
on
the
unconstitutional delegation issue explicitly identify Texas Antiquities as
restirig on this very basis. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 468; PUC v.
14

City of Austin, 728 S.W.2d 907, 911 (Tex.App.-Austin 1987, writ refd
n.r.e.].
Boll Weevil and the later anti-delegation decision in FM Properties
Operating Co. v. City ofAustin, 22 S.W.3d 868 (Tex. 2000) (striking down
statute on
constitutional ground of
illegal
delegation of legislative
authority), demonstrate that the principles informing the outcome in
Texas Antiquities, which struck down a legislative delegation to a state
administrative agency, remain applicable in the current legal era, too.
For the reasons explained in the Grayson neighbors' opening brief, CCGC
Br.
18-20, Section 382.05195{a) is unconstitutional if it is read to
authorize TCEQ to adopt a standard permit based on no more than is
present in this record.
V.
OPERATION OF THE STANDARD PERMIT PROCESS VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT OF THE GRAYSON NEIGHBORS TO OPEN COURTS.
TCEQ disparages the open courts challenge in this case by making a
theoretical argument that under the text of the statute establishing the
standard
permit"" option,
everyone--citizens,
even
Grayson
County
citizens, included-had an equal opportunity to
participate in
the
process, help craft the standard permit for hot mix asphalt plants, and, if
unhappy, challenge it in court. TCEQ Br.
16~20. The text of the statute
itself,
TCEQ argues,
creates no
disequilibrium
in
access between
industry-based interests and concerned members of the public such as
the Grayson neighbors. TCEQ Br. 18 (no ""textual basis"" for complaint).
15
The problem with this argument is the reality, not the theory, of how
administrative processes work and how the process for developing a
standard permit meshes with those processes. The record in this case
amply supports the conclusion that this was a thoroughly skewed
process, with virtually the only meaningful access afforded to industry
interests. This factual observation is not meant to denigrate asphalt
industry interests and its need to monitor and try to help shape the
standard permit.
The problem this record reveals is that locally affected citizens,
landowners, businesses, and cities are left high and dry by the standard
permit process as implemented by TCEQ under the aegis of Section
382.05195{aJ. By the time a hot mix standard permit implicates their
interests in a palpable, judicially cognizable way, it is too late. The rules
of the game are fixed in place, leaving the agency with nothing more in
answer to the outcries of local concern than a statement that there is
nothing it can do as long as the forms are filled out correctly by the
would-be plant operator.
By that point, there is no public notice
requirement and no public comment process. AR I:Tabs 4,8, & 14. 13
13 Not even the location can be evaluated by TCEQ. As a TCEQ official told one of the
citizens asking questions at the public ""meeting"" shortly before the authorization
issued, ""we don't have the statutory authority"" to have the operator look at a different
location. There are essentially no options at that point for the citizens, other than
hoping and pressing for TCEQ to do something to pay attention. TCEQ officials told the
citizens at the public meeting that 'we don't have policy authority,"" that ""we can't tell
you that remedies are instantaneous by any means,"" that there is no ""notification per
se"" to the nearby people, that TCEQ has ""very limited shutdown authority,"" and that
TCEQ ""can't look at land use compatibility,~
16

The Supreme Court's seminal open courts decision in Dillingham v.
Putnam, 109 Tex. I, 14 S.W. 303 (1890), considered not simply the text
of the legislation at issue (as TCEQ would have this Court do), but also
the practical effect of the legislation. 14 S.W. at 304 (considering a law
which ""practically"" takes away a right to court access). 14 Texas courts are
to evaluate whether the legislative action ""unreasonably impeders} a
party's access to court to assert a cause of action (the legislature] has
created."" Central Appraisal Dist. u. Lall, 924 S.W.2d 686, 689 [Tex. 1996).
The issue is whether an ""unreasonable barrier to access to the courts""
has been created, given the state interest at stake. Id.
Here, TCEQ has failed to explain why the barriers of judicial access
that flow in the wake of its use of the standard permit process for hot
mix asphalt plants are not unreasonable. It tries to defuse one obvious
shortcoming in
the standard permit arrangement by attacking the
neighbors' argument that TCEQ demonstrates its willingness to give APA
protections to the industry side, but not the citizen side, by requiring
application of the APA to undo the standard permit, but not to adopt it.
See eCGC Br. 21-23 (discussing 30 TEx, ADMIN. CODE § 116.601{b).
TCEQ charges that this argument is ""entirely off track,"" TCEQ Br. 18
14 TCEQ quibbles with the neighbors' reliance on Dillingham as an open courts decision concerned about
unequal access, claiming that such a characterization was only to make the case ""seem to cover this case""
even though, according to TCEQ, Dillingham's discussion of differential access was only ""incidental"" to
the central analysis. TCEQ Sr. 19 n.64 (last sent.). The Supreme Court treats Dillingham as an open courts
decision. See, e-g- Weinerv. Wasson, 900 SW.2d 316, 322 (Tex. 1995); R Communications v. Sharp,875
S.W.2d 314, 315 [Tex. 1994). Since Dillinghamconcerned itselfwith a law which practically deprived one
side of a lawsuit to constitutionally guaranteed access to the courts, it seems only fair and accurate to
characterize it as concerned with unequal judicial access.
17
n.61. But, TCEQ never closes its argument on this point-and that has
to be because the plain words of the rule at issue demonstrate that it is
TCEQ's argument that has gone off track. TCEQ claims that the APA
protection in subsection (b) of TCEQ's § 116.601 rule only applies to
standard permits that were created under the APA (which would exclude
the permit at issue here). The text of subsection (b) does not say that, It
says that ""[aJny standard permit"" TCEQ adopts remains in effect ""until
repealed under the APA,"" 30 TEx. ADMIN. CODE § 116.601{b) (emphasis
added).
In their public opposition to TCEQ's authorization for Plant No, 4 to
operate in their midst, the Grayson neighbors demonstrated a diligence,
an attention to detail, a deep-seated concern about their community's
well-being, and a respect for state regulatory authority. They faced an
insurmountable hurdle, though, as far as TCEQ was concerned. By the
time Plant No.4 became a live concern locally, TCEQ effectively told them
that nothing could be done because everything that mattered from a
regulatory perspective had happened four years earlier. This is the kind
of governmental sleight-of-hand the open courts provision of the Texas
Constitution was meant to disallow, and this Court should so hold,
CONCLUSION
The Court should vacate the authorization for Plant No.4 to operate.

Dear Ms. Perez Jackson, 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken. 
I 
applaud EPATs proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ 
air 
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and 
should be 
thrown out. 
That was a good first step. Now is the time for the EPA to 
take bold 
action by: 
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by 
TCEQ 
utilizing TCEQ s current illegal policy 
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired 
power 
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating 
under the 
Federal Clean Air Act standards 
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants - -  
no 
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing 
all 
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and 
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in 
accordance 
with the Federal Clean Air Act. 
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming 
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow 
existing 
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions. 

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants 
than any 
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on 
the top 
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past 
five 
years. Texans deserve better. We cannot let coal stand in the 
way of 
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules 
in 
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for 
their mess 
and that no permits issued under TCEQ's illegal permitting 
process are 
allowed to proceed forward. Strong regulations are vital to 
cleaning 
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy 
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas 
and 
protects our air quality, health and communities.

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any

Strong regulations are vital to cleaning

technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas and
protects our air quality, health and communities.
I've been most distressed to see the weak, tepid responses of TCEQ to
environmental violations in Texas.
For example,
my county,
Lavaca
County,
has more cancer cases than surrounding counties.
Is that being
monitored?
What's causing that?
TCEQ has so leaned in the direction of business-as-usual in Texas that
we are doing a great disservice to our people,
causing unnecessary
health problems,
fouling our air aggravating people with respiratory
diseases,
looking the other way along the Texas coasts as our waters
become so polluted that we canlt harvest oysters or fish in some areas.

What a dirty smear on Texas.
Texas is a primary Recreational Tourist state.
When will we get it
into our thick skulls that- that requires pristine beaches, clean and
swimmable waters,
(both coastal and river), clean air, protection of
endangered species and all waterfowl,
and conversion to wind and solar
energies which we have in ample supply (but not in any migratory bird
flyways,
thank you).
In the interim,
we have great reserves of natural
gas,
a much,
much cleaner fossil fuel than dirty coal.
No new coal plants!!
Let's get those windmills turning instead.
And
letrs get that electric grid built that can transport that energy out
of state to the northeast where it is needed,
supplying Texas with a
nice chunk of change and a cleaner environment.
Come on,
Texans,
move
it!
Thank you for your consideration.

Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
I
am so pleased you are forcing the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality to enforce the Clean Air Act -- especially in the permitting of
coal fired power plants.
For too long,
the Texas utilities have been
allowed to disregard the environment and health of people in the
persuit of profitable dirty coal operations.
It is wonderful that you
.are regulating carbon dioxide emissions as a polutant.
Current
regulations must be enhanced to make a difference in the slope of
global warming increase.
I
hope you also revisit the EPA rulling under the last administration
that mercury emissions from coal plants are not a health hazard to be
regulated.
As
a Ph.D.
chemist,
I
was never convinced of the validity
of that conclusion.
Please keep up the good work.
Thank heavens some body in the federal government finally cares!

Dear Ms. Perez Jackson, 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken. 
I 
applaud EPA1s proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ 
air 
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and 
should be 
thrown out. 
That was a good first step. Now is the time for the EPA to 
take bold 
act ion by : 
- Halting any new air pollution permits from being issued by 
TCEQ 
utilizing TCEQ1s current illegal policy 
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired 
power 
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating 
under the 
Federal Clean Air Act standards 
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants - -  
no 
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing 
all 
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and 
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in 
accordance 
with the Federal Clean Air Act. 
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming 
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow 
existing 
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions. 

Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants 
than any 
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on 
the top 
of the list for the largest increase in emissions over the past 
five 
years. Texans deserve better. We cannot let coal stand in the 
way of 
our clean energy future in Texas--the EPA must put strong rules 
in 
place to make sure the coal industry is held responsible for 
their mess 
and that no permits issued under TCEQ1s illegal permitting 
process are 
allowed to proceed forward. Strong regulations are vital to 
cleaning 
up the energy industry and putting us on a path to clean energy 
technology that boosts economic growth, creates jobs in Texas 
and 
protects our air quality, health and communities. 
Please please look into Big Brown coal mine in Freestone 
County. 
It has been said we have the dirtiest air,of any county in 
Texas. Our 
group Citizen's for Environmental Clean-up, have had an air 
monitor 
approved in the county budget. In 2007 they ""lostw our bid 
sheet. This 
year after approva1,about 10 days later Byron Cook came to town 
and 
said if we really needed one,TCEQ would get us one. We are 
already 
aware of their monitors with charcoal filters to give ambient 
readings. 
Please help us to breathe.

Between 1977 and 1991, I was in graduate school and later taught at the
University of Pittsburgh. The city and its people were wonderful.  But
the coal burning electrical plants, from the coal used in the coking
industry (the last vestiges of the steel industry left in the city),
and two centuries of burning coal for heat in homes and businesses left
terrible scars on the natural landscape, the buildings, and on people's
health. Even after the two Pittsburgh Renaissance programs cleaned up

the city enormously, many neighborhoods, poor as well as affluent, were
being poisoned by continued burning of coal.
At around 2:00 AM in our neighborhood, the benzene-filled smoke
illegally released by the coking mills and electrical plants was so
thick you could turn on the light in your bedroom and see the blue
brown smoke suspended in the air around you if the window had been left
open.  A reddish brown seeped into the clouds over Pittsburgh until
around 11:00 A.M.  Walking to my office in the 42-story Cathedral of
Learning in Oakland area of Pittsburgh about a quarter of a mile away,
I could usually see only the first 25 stories of the building, the top
half still covered by brown/red tint of the smoke filled clouds.
At that time my next-door-neighbor was an environmental engineer for
the E.P.A. who monitored equipment on the stacks at the Braddock mills
during the night hours when companies illegally released pollutants
that would have been visible to regulators during daytime releases.
Most of the plants were releasing pollutants significantly above EPA
legal limits.  Only occasionally could a small fine be imposed.
In 1998 I moved to Austin.  My family had settled in Texas in the late
1820s, one uncle a surveyor for Stephen F. Austin, his brother, the
first Episcopal missionary to Texas.  My grandfather was one of the
first promoters of the rice business from the 1880s until his death in
1920. He sponsored the Texas Rice Pavilion at the Chicago World's Fair
in 1893, bringing in early rice farming families to settle in Colorado,
Wharton, and Matagorda counties.  Letters and diaries of family members
and others noted the constant the struggles of people trying to settle
in Texas in those earliest years.  Those who survived and stayed to
work the land and create small businesses did so because they saw in
the beautiful and abundant natural resources opportunities for their
families to live healthier, more prosperous lives. The environmental
problems we face in the state now could not have been imagined then.
Yet people who live in Texas and those who continue to move here carry
within them the same hopes for a healthier, more fulfilling environment
than the places they left.
The abundant resources and beauty of Texas are going to follow the same
documented downward environmental spiral as Pittsburgh and other
beautiful cities of the Midwest and Northeast unless Texans receive the
EPA's immediate help in forcing the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality to do the work people of this state commissioned them to do.  I
am requesting that the Environmental Protection Agency take action to
prevent TCEQ air pollution permits as long as those permits illegally
fail to adhere to the Clean Air Act.  We need your help in stopping the
construction of any coal fired electrical plants in Texas until the
TCEQ begins to operate in thorough compliance with the Federal Clean
Air Act Standards.  Texas citizens ask you to support and enforce
stronger environmental rulings to prevent escalation of environmental
warming.
Environmental warming poses an immediate threat to our health and our
economy here in Texas.  With the extreme statewide drought this summer,
the only other places on earth hotter than Austin, Texas (and Phoenix,

Arizona) were Baghdad and Riyadh. Heavy environmental pollution
increased the state's vulnerability to La Niña which has created over
the entire middle third of Texas a severe drought for the past two
years.  The unusually stagnant high pressure system over a good portion
of the state during the summer prevented the heavy industrial
pollutants in the Houston and other industrial areas from clearing out.
In 1954 on my other grandfather's dairy farm northwest of Waco, Texas,
we helped haul water in large dairy milk cans to cattle when the deep
artesian well on the farm went dry during that drought of record.
Climatologists predict the present drought in Texas may be even more
severe.  Crops were decimated on my farm further south in the Upper
Coastal area of the state this past year. Rice is the only crop that
produced some income.  The Lower Colorado River Authority announced
last week that rice farmers can expect their irrigation water to be cut
off for farming next year.  Real estate investors and highway and power
plant construction companies are positioning themselves for another
land grab at the expense of the voting citizens of the state.  Texas is
in severe need of environmental reform for many reasons.
Texas citizens are relying on the Environmental Protection Agency to
force TCEQ to obey EPA laws.  At a time of rapidly expanding global
population and food shortages, U.S. agricultural markets are growing
stronger ties with Latin American neighbors, with Cuba, with various
African, Asian, and Middle Eastern countries.  Agricultural production
and the increasing number of American industries in need of those raw
materials is an economic opportunity that will expand rapidly in the
future.  To protect the health and prosperity of our country and the
future of families all over the globe, Texas and the U.S. need stronger
environmental laws.  We in Texas need your immediate help creating a
moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power plants in
Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the Federal
Clean Air Act standards.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) provides the following comments on
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed action referenced above. TCEQ's
comments are detailed below.
I.
TCEQ's 2005 Submittal
A.
Anti-backsliding (Section V.A., 74 Federal Register 48472)
As EPA discusses, the anti-backsliding issue associated with the status of the
requirements for compliance with the l-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality
Standard (NAAQS) with the implementation of the 8-hour ozone NAAQS was
delayed by litigation that took several years to become [mal.
TCEQ adopted
changes to 30 Texas Administrative Code (Tex. Admin. Code) § 116.12(18/ in
June, 2005, prior to the resolution of the litigation.
After the South Coast
decision.' EPA subsequently stated it would conduct rulemaking to address the 1-
hour ozone NAAQS requirements.'

Missing References III the PSD Program (Section IV.B. 74 Federal
Register 48472)
EPA expressed concern related to the lack of a specific definition of best
available control teclmology (BACT) in TCEQ rule; and the absence of a
requirement contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §
52.21(rX4) concerning PSD review should the relaxation ofan enforceable
limitation specifically cause a source to become a major source. Although
these references are currently missing from 30 Tex. Admin. Code §
116.160, in its permitting actions, the TCEQ does not circumvent federal
New Source Review (FNSR) requirements and does not allow a control
teclmology review to be conducted that results in a teclmology that is less
than BACT defined in federal rule. TCEQ agrees that ifa project becomes
a major source through the relaxation of an enforceable limitation, PSD
review is required, and TCEQ complies with that requirement in its
permitting actions.
The missing references are oversights, and will be
corrected at the next available rulemaking opportunity.""

Texas Permitting Program."" The definition ofthe term ""facility"" is
one of the cornerstones ofthe Texas Permitting Program under the
Texas Clean Air Act.
TCEQ appreciates the opportunity to
address this point as its interpretation of Texas law differs from
that of EPA as discussed below. In addition, to provide clarity and
consistency, TCEQ
will provide similar comments here and in
regard to
Docket ID No. EPA-R06-0AR-2005-TX-0025 and
Docket ID No. EPA-R06-0AR-2006-TX-0032.
As stated by EPA, it understands that the state uses a ""dual
definition for the term facility.""
Under the Texas Clean Air Act'
and TCEQ rule,"" ""facility"" is defined as ""a discrete or identifiable
structure, device, item, equipment, or enclosure that constitutes or
contains a stationary source, including appurtenances other than
emission control equipment. A mine,. quarry, well test, or road is
not considered to be a facility.""
A facility may constitute or
contain a stationary source -- a point of origin of a contaminant.""
As a discrete point, a facility can constitute but cannot contain a
""major stationary source"" as defmed by federal law. A facility is
subject to Major and Minor NSR requirements, depending on the
facts ofthe specific application.
Under Major NSR, EPA uses the term ""emissions unit"" (generally)
when referring to part of a ""stationary source""; TCEQ translates
""emissions unit"" to mean ""facility'?"" which is at least as stringent
as
federal
rule.
TCEQ
and
its
predecessor
agencies
have
consistently interpreted facility to preclude inclusion of more than
one stationary source, in contrast to EPA's stated understanding.
Likewise, TCEQ does not interpret facility to include ""every
emissions point on a company site, even if limiting these emission
points to only those belonging to the same industrial grouping (SIC
code)."" The federal definition of ""major stationary source""ll is not
equivalent to the
state definition of ""source.,,12
A ""major
stationary source"" can include more than one ""facility"" as defined
under Texas law - which is consistent with EPA's interpretation of
a ""major stationary source"" including more than one emissions
unit.

The
above interpretation of the
term
""facility""
has
been
consistently applied by the TCEQ and its predecessor agencies for
more than 30 years. The TCEQ's interpretation of Texas statutes
enacted by the Texas Legislature is addressed by the Texas Code
Construction Act. More specifically, words and phrases that have
acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative
definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.13
While Texas law does not directly refer to the two steps allowing
deference enunciated by Justice Stevens writing for a unanimous
Court in Chevron US.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc.,14 Texas law and judicial interpretation recognize
Chevron15 and follow similar analysis as discussed below.
The Texas Legislature intends an agency created to centralize
expertise in a certain regulatory area ""be given a large degree of
latitude in the methods it uses to accomplish its regulatory
function.,,16
Further, Texas courts construe the text of an
administrative rule under the same principles as if it were a
statute.17
Texas administrative agencies have the power to
interpret their own rules, and their interpretation is entitled to great
weight and deference.'!
The agency's construction of its rule is
controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent.l"" ""When
the construction of an administrative regulation rather than a
statute is in issue, deference is even more clearly in order.,,2o This
is particularly true when the rule involves complex subject
13 Tex. Gov't Code § 311.01l(b).
14 Chevron US.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Cauncil, lnc., 467 U.S 837, 842-43 (1984). ""When a
court reviews anagency's construction ofthe statute whichit administers, it is confronted withtwo questions. First,
always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.
If the intent of
Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the
unarobiguously expressed intent ofCongress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed
the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be
necessary inthe absence of anadministrative interpretation. Rather, ifthe statute is silentorambiguous withrespect
to the specific issue,the question forthe court is whether the agency's answer is basedon apermissible construction
ofthe statute.""

Texas courts recognize that the legislature intends an
agency created to centralize expertise in a certain regulatory area
""be given a large degree of latitude in the methods it uses to
accomplish its regulatory function.,,22
In sunnnary, TCEQ translates ""emissions unit"" to mean ""facility.""
Just as an ""emissions unit"" under federal law is construed by EPA
as part of a major stationary source, a ""facility"" under Texas law
can be part of a major stationary source.
However, a facility
carmot include more than one stationary source as defined under
Texas law.
c.
Inclusion of Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction (SSM) Emissions
in the Definition of ""Baseline Actual Emissions"" (Section VLB. 74
Federal Register 48475)
EPA points out that the use of ""baseline actual emissions"" must
include SSM emissions. The TCEQ includes maintenance, startup
and shutdown emissions in the development of ""baseline actual
emissions"" to the extent that the permit reviewer can verify that
these emissions occurred, were properly quantified and reported as
part of the baseline, and were creditable.
Otherwise, startup and
shutdown, as well as maintenance, emissions are treated as
unauthorized and, as such, have a baseline actual emission rate of
zero. Further, the TCEQ does not authorize malfunction emissions.
The TCEQ has concerns about crediting a major source with an
emission associated with malfunctioning of equipment when the
source determines baseline actual emissions.
The TCEQ is
concerned that including malfunction emissions would inflate the
baseline and narrow the gap between baseline actual emissions and
the plarmed emission rate.
Therefore, the number of ""major""
sources or modifications would be reduced.
It is unclear how
emissions that are not authorized would be considered creditable
within the concept ofFNSR applicability.
EPA has approved the exclusion of malfunction emissions from
the baseline calculation in other states' ruIes.23 TCEQ considers the
21 See Equitable Trust Co. v. Finance Comm'n, 99 S.W.3d 384,387 (Tex.App.-Austin 2003, uo pet.).
22 Reliant Energy, Inc. v. Public Vtil. Comm'n, 62 S.W.3d 833, 838 (Tex.App.-Austin 2001, no pet.) (citing
Statev. Public Vtil. Comm'n, 883 S.W.2d 190, 197 (Tex.1994)).
23 EPA has approved the omission of the phase ""malfunction emissions"" from the defmition of ""baseline
actual emissions"" as adopted by three states, based on its analysis that such an exclusion is acceptable for fmding
that the rules are at least as stringent as the federal rule.
See proposed proposal approval of rules submitted by
Florida, 73 Federal Register 18466, 18470-71, (April 4, 2008), fmal rule approval 73 Federal Register 36435 (June
27,2008); proposed approval of rules submitted by South Carolina, 73 Federal Register 52031, 52035 (September

exclusion of malfunction emissions from baseline actual emissions
to be at least as stringent as the federal rule. TCEQ is willing to
work with EPA to clarify the inclusion of startup and shutdown
emissions when determining baseline actual emissions.
d.
Definition of ""baseline actual emission rate"" (Sections VLA. and
VLB. 74 Federal Register 48474 - 48475)
The TCEQ does not use a rate that differs from the FNSR
requirement. The TCEQ definition of""actual emissions'S"" includes
the modifier ""average,"" and ""actual emissions"" are included in the
definition of ""baseline actual emissions rate.,,25
In practice, the
TCEQ contends that a reading of the entire definition, including
parts (a) - (d), results in an average emission rate being used to
establish a baseline actual emission rate.
This is because to
determine an actual emission rate in tons per year from a
consecutive 24 month period requires averaging the emissions over
24 months to obtain an annual emission rate (an average annual
emission rate).
The TCEQ is willing to work with EPA to address any changes
necessary to clarify the definition, and specifically reference that a
baseline actual emission rate is an average emission rate, in tons
per year, of a federally regulated new source review pollutant.
3.
Plantwide Applicability Limitation (PAL) Program (Section VIA 74
Federal Register 48474 - 48475)
a.
Missing and Unclear PAL Requirements
EPA commented that the TCEQ rules do not include provisions for
PAL re-openings; requirements concerning the use of monitoring
systems (and associated definitions); and a provision which limits
applicability of a PAI. only to an existing major stationary source.
In addition, the current TCEQ rule, concerning emissions to be
included in a proposed PAL, does not require that all facilities at a
major source, emitting a pollutant for which a PAL is being
requested, be included in the PAL.
EPA also commented thata
12, 2007), [mal rule approval 73 Federal Register 31369 (June 2, 2008); and proposed approval of rules submitted
by Georgia, 73 Federal Register 51606, 51609 (September 4,2008), [mal rule approval 73 Federal Register 79653

PAL can include every emissions point at a site, without limiting
these emissions points to only those belonging to the same
industrial grouping (SIC) code. Notwithstanding the ""lack of
explicit limitation,"" i.e., defining facility to equal emissions unit;
that is how the rule is applied and that will be addressed in
rulemaking.

TCEQ
will

EPA's
concerns

participation for PALs in a separate rulemaking regarding public
participation for the NSR £ermitting program at its December 9,

B.
Pollution Control Projects (PCP) Standard Permit (74 Federal Register
48476)
The TCEQ PCP Standard Permit has been used to implement control technologies
required by regulatory changes, statutory changes, and/or EPA consent decree
provisions.
As such, control devices may be applied to numerous different
facility types and industry types, ranging from storage tanks to fired units. TCEQ
understands EPA's comments and will work with EPA to develop an approvable
authorization(s) that will achieve the same goals and emission reductions.
III.
TCEQ's Plan to Correct Deficiencies
The TCEQ understands that EPA's review was conducted by applying the current
applicable law. The Executive Director will conduct a review of all EPA comments and
propose changes to the rules proposed for disapproval.
The TCEQ understands EPA's concerns with issues regarding, among other things,
applicability,
clarity,
enforceability,
replicable
procedures,
recordkeeping,
and
compliance assurance. Specifically, the Executive Director will consider rulemaking to
address the following concerns:
•
re-adopt the missing sections of the PSD Program (EPA's definition of BACT,
and addressing relaxation ofan enforceable limitation);
•
clarify references for major stationary sources and major modifications to EPA
rules for nonattainment and maintenance area defmitions and removing rule
language indicating that the l-hour thresholds and offsets are not effective unless
the EPA promulgates rules, and clarifying the applicability of nonattainment
permitting rules;
26 As discussed in 74 Federal Register 48480, in Section V.F., at 48490-91.

Comments by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
Docket 1DNo. EPA~R06-0AR-2006-0133
Page 8 of8
•
clarify the definition of baseline actual emission rate, and clarify the inclusion of
maintenance, startup, and shutdown emissions when determining baseline actual
emissions; and
•
add missing items and clarify the existing requirements to obtain and comply with
a PAL to meet FNSR requirements.
New and amended rules will be subject to the statutory and regulatory requirements for a
SIP revision, as interpreted in EPA policy and guidance on SIP revisions, as well as
applicable Texas law. The revised program will ensure protection of the NAAQS, and
demonstrate noninterference with the Texas SIP control strategies and reasonable further
progress.
In addition, and as noted, TCEQ will address EPA's concerns regarding public
participation in a separate rulemaking action/""

Dear Mr. Spruiell,
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is broken.  I
applaud EPA's proposed ruling that major portions of the TCEQ air
permitting process does not adhere to the Clean Air Act, and should be
thrown out.
That was a good first step.  Now is the time for the EPA to take bold
action by:

utilizing TCEQ's current illegal policy
- Creating a moratorium on the operations of any new coal fired power
plants in Texas until the TCEQ cleans up its act by operating under the
Federal Clean Air Act standards
- Requiring coal companies clean up their old, dirty plants -- no
exemptions, no bailouts, and no special treatment by reviewing all
permits issued since the TCEQ adopted its illegal policies and
requiring that these entities resubmit their applications in accordance
with the Federal Clean Air Act.
- Put stronger rules in place in order to reduce global warming
emissions and to makes sure new laws and rules do not allow existing
coal plants to pollute old global warming emissions.
Texas has more proposed coal and pet coke fired power plants than any
other state in the nation, is #1 in carbon emissions, and is on the top

Dear Mr. Mooney: 
On behalf of BP Products, North America Inc. (BP), I am pleased to submit these 
comments supporting the proposed plan of action to redesignate the Toledo non- 
attainment area as attainment for the 8-hour ozone standard and to approve Ohio's 
maintenance plan SIP revision for the Toledo area. 
BP's Toledo Refinery, as well as several marketing and dstribution facilities, are in the 
Toledo non-attainment area that is being considered for redesignation. As such, we wdl be 
impacted by EPA's decision regardng the proposed redesignation. 
We support the proposed redesignation request, and we encourage the EPA to approve 
the request as expeditiously as possible. We believe that the most recent three years of 
ambient air quality monitoring data, which demonstrate that the area has attained the 8- 
hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone, and the Ohio EPA 
petition for redesignation of the area from non-attainment to attainment contain adequate 
evidence that the area is currently attaining the NAAQS for ozone. We also believe that 
the Ohio EPA, by worhng closely with the local governmental and industrial sectors and 
the State legslature in developing this plan of action, has developed an adequate 
maintenance plan which demonstrates that the area will remain in attainment of the 
standard, even allowing for growth. 
BP believes in doing its part to ensure a clean environment and we have taken necessary 
steps to help attain the ozone standard in the Toledo area. We have already made 
sipficant reductions of VOC emissions at our Toledo Refinery, and we are producing the 
fuels that meet EPA's standards for sulfur and other parameters to assist in the attainment 
of the ozone standard in the State of Ohio. We believe that these reductions have played a 
significant role in bringing the Toledo area into attainment.

The American Composites Manufacturers Association is pleased to comment on EPA’s proposed 
adoption of an amended Indiana State Implementation Plan, as published in the Federal Register 
on January 25, 2007.  (72 FR 3377) 
  
Indiana’s amended SIP would exempt from requirements of the VOC rules contained in the SIP 
those facilities subject to the boat manufacturing and reinforced plastic composites production 
NESHAP.  As EPA correctly notes in the January 25 Notice, the major VOC emitted from these 
facilities are subject under the NESHAP to enforceable emission reductions.  An additional 
requirement to comply with the SIP VOC rules would place a redundant and unnecessary 
administrative burden on both the facilities and the state. 
  
A study conducted for ACMA in 2003 evaluated whether composite manufacturing operations at 
which all VOC sources comply with the NESHAP would also satisfy VOC requirements, and 
concluded that a facility that meets the NESHAP requirements should also automatically comply 
with VOC SIP requirements, including LAER, BACT and RACT.  A copy of this study is 
attached. 
  
ACMA strongly supports EPA’s approval of the proposed amendment to the Indiana SIP.

Comments by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 
EPA Docket ID No. EPA-R06-OAR-2007-0209 
Background 
On November 26, 2008, EPA published a notice in the Federal Register (Notice) 
proposing action on various public participation rules submitted by the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) which were adopted or amended 
primarily in response to House Bill (HB) 801 (76'"" Texas Legislature, 1999). TCEQ 
appreciates EPA's understanding that overall programmatic issues, such as public 
participation, must be resolved prior to resolution on more specific aspects of TCEQ's air 
permitting rules submitted for approval into Texas' State Implementation Plan (SIP). 
Subsequent to action on the rules that this Notice addresses (rules submitted between 
December 1995 and October 1999), TCEQ adopted new and amended some existing 
public participation rules, as partially acknowledged in Footnote 1 of the Notice; those 
rule changes should also be addressed as part of the overall programmatic rules submitted 
to EPA. 
TCEQ also appreciates that EPA has found that the rules contain some provisions that 
meet or exceed federal requirements, and strengthen the existing SIP, as described in 
Section I11 of the Notice. Although TCEQ acknowledges that some rule amendments 
may be necessary for clarification, the rules that are the subject of this Notice essentially 
meet federal requirements, do not result in any backsliding from the approved SIP, 
strengthen the SIP and should be approved. 
The TCEQ,' when implementing HB 801, consolidated the public participation rules2 for 
air permit applications with other agency permitting programs for the first time since the 
1993 merger of the Texas Air Control Board (TACB), the Texas Water Commission and 
certain programs formerly administered by the Texas Department of Health into a new 
agency, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), per Senate Bill 
2 (72nd Texas Legislature, 1'' C.S. 1991)~ 
The TCEQ understood the Texas Legislature wanted notice to be provided early in the 
permitting process for a variety of permit programs, including other federal permit 
programs delegated to the state of Texas, such as the Texas Pollutant Discharge 
Elimination System (TPDES) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) 
programs. At the time HB 801 passed, the TCEQ processed many more air quality 
1 The agency was known as the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission at the time the rules 
that are the subject of this notice were adopted. In 2002, the agency name was changed to the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality. Regardless of the time period referenced, these comments refer to 
the agency's current name, unless otherwise noted. 
2 Although some of the rules, such as those in 30 Tex. Admin. Code Chapter 39, Subchapter K, were 
submitted in full, only those portions of other rules which are applicable to air permit applications, such as 
those in 30 Tex. Admin. Code Chapter 39, Subchapter H, were submitted. Based on meetings with EPA 
staff regarding other multi-media rules that were, in part, submitted as a revision to the Texas SIP, TCEQ 
staff understood that EPA would accept rule subsections as revisions to the SIP, and therefore did not 
segregate air quality public participation rules, such as in Chapter 39, Subchapter H. 
3 
As part of the rule consolidation project, and to implement the changes effective September 1, 1999 in 
HB 801, some of the rules that are the subject of this notice are applicable only to applications received on 
or after September 1, 1999.

permit actions than any other permitting program. Texas has a more extensive permitting 
program, for both minor and major sources, than perhaps any other state in the country, 
not only because of the amount and variety of types of industry in the state, but also 
because of its extensive minor source permitting program, established in the 1970s.~ 
That was acknowledged by the legislature when it maintained the requirement for notice 
for certain air permit applications. The agency's rule regarding notice of a minor source 
air quality permit application5 did not specify precisely when the notice should be given, 
and, in practice, could be at any time fiom receipt of application by the agency to after 
preparation of the draft permit that was ready for issuance. 
HB 801, and the 
corresponding new rules, resulted in a more uniform notice time period for notice of the 
application for minor and major new source review (NSR) permit applications. Given the 
long history of a small number of contested case hearings on air permit applications, the 
legislature revised the public participation scheme which acknowledged the need for 
efficient processing of applications by establishing an early public participation process 
that would provide certainty to applicants whose applications were not subject to further 
notice, which was consistent with the existing state law and the agency's SIP-approved 
rules. The TCAA has long provided for exemptions fiom permitting, and authorizations 
that do not require notice. The agency's public notice rules have reflected this over the 
years. 
The Legislature essentially maintained existing and added additional notice 
requirements as a part of HB 801, as discussed below. 
Prior to HB 801, TCEQ's rules regarding public participation that were approved into the 
Texas SIP required notice of application of minor source applications, notice of draft 
permit for Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and non attainment permit 
applications, sign posting, and opportunity for public comment and contested case 
hearing, and notification of the agency's final a ~ t i o n . ~  
Those rules, as well as the current 
rules, meet and, in part, exceed the federal public participation requirements. As 
indicated in a letter fiom TCEQ Executive Director Glenn Shankle to Mr. Larry Starfield 
of EPA Region 6 dated June 13, 2008, the TCEQ provided justification that TCEQ's 
public participation rules are approvable as a SIP revision. 
In the Notice, EPA 
acknowledges that some rule revisions strengthen the SIP.' 
In implementing the 
requirements of HB 801, the public participation rules relating to air permitting were 
clarified and strengthened as compared to the rules that previously applied and were 
approved into the SIP;' those are articulated in Section I11 of the Notice. 
TCEQ acknowledges there were some additions to the public participation rules, such as 
referencing various types of permits (including flexible permits) or generic references 
that need additional specificity, that were not in the previously SIP approved rules. 
TCEQ maintains, however, that the implementation of the new requirements in HB 801 
and the commission's reorganization of its public participation rules for air quality 
permits as part of its overall public participation rules did not constitute a relaxation of

the SIP, as prohibited by § 1 lO(1) of the Federal Clean Air Act (FcAA).~ TCEQ's rules 
meet federal requirements, although further clarification may be necessary to ensure 
certain rules sufficiently reflect federal public participation requirements for certain air 
quality permit applications. Therefore, the EPA should not disapprove, in any fashion, 
any of TCEQ's rules and subject the TCEQ to possible sanctions under FCAA 5 179(b).I0 
The TCEQ's responses to specific provisions of the Notice are discussed below. 
A. Response to Rule Deficiencies Discussed in Section IV of the Notice 
1. Section 1V.A. Regarding; New or Modified Minor NSR Sources. 
The Notice lists four specific deficiencies in certain Chapter 39 rules. 
The first 
deficiency is that 8 39.41 9(e)11 does not include a requirement for notice of draft permit 
and air quality analysis (notice of application and preliminary decision [NAPD], 
commonly referred to as ""second notice"") for new or modified minor NSR sources or 
minor modifications at major sources, as required by 40 CFR 5 1.16 1 (a) and (b), unless a 
contested case hearing request is received and not withdrawn after the NAPD is 
published. 
The second deficiency is that although a permit amendment is required where there is 
change in method of control of emissions, a change in the character of emissions or an 
increase in the emission rate of any air contaminant, no public participation is required 
unless the change is a new facility or modification of existing facility that results in 
251250 ton per year (tpy) increase,12 citing 39.403(b)(8). 
EPA's third deficiency is that 8 39.4 19(e)(l)(C) does not include a requirement for notice 
of draft permit and air quality analysis for any amendment, modification or renewal of a 
major or minor source if there is no increase in allowable emissions and no new air 
contaminants, or unacceptable compliance history. 
TCEQ's primary concern with these three alleged deficiencies is that EPA interprets 
51.161(a) and (b) to require Texas to provide notice of draft permit and air quality 
analysis of all proposed new or modified minor sources. TCEQ has two reasons why 
these rules are not deficient. First, if EPA intended that specific requirements apply to 
every minor NSR permit action, it must provide clear notice of that requirement so States 
can comply. Texas' public notice rules have been, for the most part, SIP-approved for 
many years and were written to meet both federal and state law. Those federal rules, now 
42 USC 5 7410(1). 
lo 42 USC 5 7509(b). 
11 All rules cited in this document are found in Title 30 of the Texas Administrative Code. Therefore, only 
the section numbers are used in the citations to specific rules. 
12 The text of the rule cites to ""the emission quantities defined in 5 106.4(a)(l) . . . and of sources defined 
in $106.4(a)(2) and (3) . . ."" 
Subsection (a)(l) defines what is commonly referred to as the insignificant 
limits for which a permit by rule (PBR) can be claimed, that is, emissions that do not exceed 250 tpy of 
carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxides, or 25 tpy of any other air contaminant except carbon dioxide, water 
nitrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen and oxygen. The sources defined in subsections (a)(2) and (3) are 
those excluded f?om qualifying for a PBR, which are new major stationary sources or major modifications 
subject to PSD or nonattainrnent NSR review.

codified at 40 CFR 5 1.160-5 1.164, have essentially not changed in the more than 35 
years since they were adopted by EPA in 1973. l3 1f EPA chooses to interpret those rules 
in a different way, then it should conduct rulemaking to provide opportunity for notice 
and comment on the changes, and then give states adequate time to comply. As 
discussed herein, Texas reasonably relied on the plain language of 40 CFR 51.160- 
5 1.164, and EPA's approval of most of the public notice rules that are predecessors to the 
rules that are the subject of this notice. 
Sections 5 1.160-5 1.164 apply to all of the NSR permitting program, and, in particular, to 
the minor NSR permitting program. These rules were originally adopted prior to the 
creation of the PSD permit program in 1977, which has its own detailed public 
participation requirements in 40 CFR 5 1.166(q). 
Although 5 1.166(q) includes more 
requirements with greater detail regarding public participation for major sources, no 
similar rulemaking has been adopted by EPA for minor sources.14 Because EPA has 
adopted only these few broad rules to implement the general requirement in the FCAA to 
have a minor NSR program,15 and because EPA has failed to interpret those rules other 
than actions regarding a minimal number of recent SIPs submitted by states, States may 
rely on the broad language of 5 1.160-5 1.164. Further, EPA has not issued any guidance 
document that is available to the States. 
Section 5 1.161, the basis for EPA's deficiency, cannot be applied without considering its 
purpose, which is to implement 5 1.160 by specifying requirements for public availability 
of information. Section 5 1.160 requires SIPs to include legally enforceable procedures 
that enable states to allow for construction and modification of sources that will not 
violate applicable portions of the control strategy nor interfere with attainment or 
maintenance of a national standard. The rule is very broadly written, and therefore 
provides states and local agencies wide latitude to determine the boundaries of which 
facilities will be subject to review. In 1973 when EPA adopted the predecessor rule16 it 
stated that SIPs should address the ""types and sizes of facilities, buildings, structures, or 
installations which will be subject to review under this section."" Notably, that language 
remains in the rule today, with the following addition, that ""[tlhe plan must discuss the 
basis for determining which facilities will be subject to review.""17 The plain, broad 
language of this subsection anticipates that some facilities will 
be subject to review. 
It supports EPA's repeatedly stated position that States have broad discretion to 
determine the scope of their minor NSR programs as needed to attain and maintain the 
national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), a primary component of these federal 
rules. In addition, EPA acknowledges that there is a great deal of variation among the 
states' minor NSR permitting programs. EPA has approved Texas' minor source 
permitting program rules that include a requirement that major source permitting 
requirements cannot be circum~ented.'~ 
Therefore, that protection is in place, and Texas 
law provides for challenge of an agency action that is not protective of the NAAQs.'~

TCEQ is aware of the rules proposed in 1995, but never adopted by EPA. TCEQ does not find that 
proposal persuasive or legally controlling as to current interpretation of federal law.

With regard to the specific requirements of 5 1.16 1, only minimal specificity regarding 
the control stiategy requirement of 5 1.160 is included. In subsection (a), the State is 
required to provide opportunity for public comment on information submitted by owners 
and operators. This subsection also states that the public information must include the 
agency's analysis of the effect of construction or modification on ambient air quality, 
including the agency's proposed approval or disapproval. Subsection (b) prescribes three 
minimum requirements to satisfy the opportunity for public comment in subsection (a). 
The first requirement is notice by prominent advertising in the area affected. Clearly, 
since TCEQ rules require that the application be made available for inspection and 
copying in a public place in or near the municipality in which the proposed facility will 
be located, as well as the requirement to post signs and publish newspaper notice 
(including, for certain applications, in alternate languages) stating that this submitted 
application is available for review, the TCEQ not only meets but exceeds this 
requirement.20 The second is that the public have a 30 day comment period, which can 
be extended by the executive director or if the close of a public meeting is more than 30 
days from publication.21 TCEQ also clearly meets this requirement. 
The third requirement is that the public be able to comment on the state or local agency's 
analysis of the effect on air quality, which, according to 5 1.16 1 (a), includes the agency's 
proposed approval or disapproval. It appears that the TACB, and subsequently the 
TCEQ, described this overall requirement as the opportunity to comment on the agency's 
preliminary decision. The agency reaches a preliminary decision when all regulatory 
analyses are completed indicating that, among other requirements, that the NAAQS will 
not be violated, and a draft permit is prepared. Therefore, the agency has completed its 
air quality analysis which includes a draft permit. In 1987, TACB proposed a revision to 
the rule language (in the rule since at least 1981) to exempt minor sources from the 
requirement to include in the notice an opportunity to comment on the agency's 
preliminary decision. The exemption was agreed upon by TACB and EPA Region 6 
when a compromise was reached as part of that rulemaking.22 The rule was revised to 
include in the notice the opportunity to comment on the agency's preliminary decision 
only for major sources regulated under FCAA, Title 1, Parts C and ~

Therefore, TCEQ relied on EPA's approval of its minor NSR notice rules as the new 
rules were adopted in subsequent years; the EPA continued to approve the latest version, 
fj 1 16.132, as recently as 2002 and 2006.2~ 
Even though TCEQ relied on the existing SIP approval as guidance for drafting the new 
sections in Chapter 39, the rules provide an opportunity to comment on the preliminary 
determination for minor NSR applications, as long as a hearing is requested. Second 
notice (NAPD) is required for applications which receive a timely request for contested 
case hearing, as discussed in more detail below in Section B."" 
It is within this context that EPA should evaluate TCEQ's rules. TCEQ relied on EPA's 
prior evaluations of its public participation rules, which would have been reviewed for 
compliance with 40 CFR 5 1.160 and 5 1.16 1. After many years of these broadly worded 
rules as the only EPA interpretations of the FCAA's requirement for a minor source 
permitting 
TCEQ adopted the rules at issue without any backsliding from 
previous SIP-approved rules. 
Therefore, it was rational and reasonable for TCEQ to 
adopt the rules that are the subject of this Notice. Without any other adequate notice of 
what States are required to do, EPA lacks legal authority to require additional specific 
elements when the broad criteria are met. 
Second, if EPA is considering any disapproval of these rules based on recent 
interpretations regarding what an approvable minor NSR program consists of, then EPA 
should afford Texas deference as it has for other states in crafting their minor NSR 
programs. The notices of EPA action on other states' rules and proposed rules for Indian 
Country, discussed in the Notice at page 72008, should be considered as EPA evaluates 
TCEQ's rules. TCEQ agrees that the examples cited illustrate EPA's interpretation that 
states have ""broad discretion to determine the scope of their minor NSR programs as 
needed to attain and maintain the NAAQS,"" and that states have ""significant discretion to 
tailor minor NSR requirements that are consistent with the requirements of Part 51."" 
However, since all of the cited examples occurred after (2000-2007) the adoption of the 
TCEQ rules that are the subject of the Notice, TCEQ could not have the benefit of that 
information to consider when implementing HB 80 1. 
The only other outstanding, general indication of public participation requirements that 
would apply to minor stationary sources and minor modifications can be found in EPA's 
proposed rules for permitting in Indian ~ountry.2~ 
This proposed rule gives the first 
indication of how EPA interprets how project netting will be a part of the minor NSR 
permit program. Under this proposal, net emission increases less than specified minor 
NSR thresholds are subject to the administrative revision process, which does not include

public participation.30 This proposal illustrates that EPA is willing to approve a minor 
NSR program with exceptions to notice. TCEQ's minor NSR program, is, for the most 
part, is subject to more stringent technical permit requirements than other minor 
programs. 
Specifically, best available control technology and off-property impact 
requirements apply, and public notice is required for those authorizations that are not 
insignificant. 
Because 51.160 allows states to determine which facilities will be subject to review, this 
exception should not be a basis for determining that $ 39.419(e) is deficient, especially 
since EPA has indicated that exceptions to these specific requirements can be granted on 
the basis of an environmental significance showing by a State. EPA's analysis that 
concluded with finding these three deficiencies turn on whether 51.161(a) and (b) are 
met, without a full analysis of whether the rules meet 5 1.1 60. When EPA delegated 
authority to the states in 5 1.160, it gave the states the right to create a holistic approach in 
creating its permitting programs and how those programs would attain and maintain the 
NAAQS. Therefore, if States have discretion as to how to implement these minor source 
programs, and if Texas' current SIP-approved public participation rules were approved, 
TCEQ's new rules in Chapter 39, should also be approvable. Given EPA's ability to 
approve a wide variation of minor NSR permitting programs, EPA must find that Texas 
public participation rules as part of its minor NSR permitting program meet the federal 
minimum requirements. 
EPA's fourth stated deficiency is that references to certain sections of the Texas Clean 
Air Act (TCAA) in $ 39.403@)(8) should be references to rules in the SIP to provide 
clarity and approvability. The TCEQ is unclear as to why this rule drafting is a 
deficiency for SIP approval. The citations are used to indicate the scope of the types of 
permits which are subject to these public participation rules and does not serve as a 
limitation as to enforceability of the Texas SIP. In addition, the Texas SIP includes 
submission of the legal authority under which the state implements federal and state 
permitting requirements which includes the part of the TCAA referenced in $ 
39.403(b)(8). 
2. Section 1V.B. Regarding Proiects Subject to PSD 
The Notice lists five omissions for notice of PSD permit applications. 
(a) 
The rules do not include an opportunity for public hearing to appear and submit 
written or oral comment on the draft permit and air quality analysis regarding an 
application for a new or modified source subject to PSD, as required by 40 CFR 
5 1.166(q)(v) and $ 165(a)(2) of the FCAA. 
TCEQ understands EPA's comment to mean that there is no precisely defined 
opportunity for a notice and comment style hearing on draft PSD permits. 40 CFR 
5 1.166(q)(v) requires a state to provide opportunity for a public hearing for interested 
persons to appear and submit written or oral comments on the air quality impact of the 
source, alternatives to it, the control technology required, and other appropriate 
considerations. As discussed above, Texas law provides opportunity for both contested 
30 Id. At 48743.

case hearings and public meetings. A timely request for a contested case hearing (as well 
as comments on the draft permit) can be made until the close of the notice period, which 
is at least 30 days after publication of the availability of the draft permit (the NAPD) for 
applications subject to second notice.31 A public meeting can be requested in response to 
the notices.32 Although § 55.152 does not specifically provide that a public meeting must 
be held after the draft permit is available for public review, the TCEQ's practice, when a 
meeting request is granted, is to generally conduct public meetings at that time in order to 
receive more meaningful input. Further, the comment period does not end prior to the 
date of a public meeting, and therefore the RTC responds to all written and oral 
comments received for the period of receipt of application until at least 30 days after 
NAPD is published and the public meeting is held, whichever is later. A person can 
request both a contested case hearing and a public meeting, as well as file comments at 
anytime during the public comment period.33 EPA accepted Texas' contested case 
hearing process many years ago as a component of the public participation process for air 
quality permit applications, including PSD applications, which was long before state law 
added the public meeting opportunity requirement added by these rules. Therefore, 
TCEQ rules meet the specified federal requirement.34 
(b) 
For a new or modified source subject to PSD, the rules do not require that the 
public notice of a PSD permit contain the degree of increment consumption that is 
expected from the source or modification, as required by 40 CFR 5 1.166(q)(iii) 
and 5 165(a)(2) of the FCAA. 
TCEQ acknowledges that the rules need to add this requirement. In practice, this 
information is included in the notice, resulting in no deficiency in the processing of PSD 
applications in Texas. 
(c) 
For a new or modified source subject to PSD, the rules do not require public 
notice of a PSD permit be sent to state and local air pollution control agencies, the 
31 8 55.152. The time can be longer in cases due to the date of alternate language publication or if a public 
meeting is held at the end of the publication period. 
32 8 3 9.4 1 1 (b)(5) and (c)(6). 
33 See additional discussion in response to Section V.A. below. 
34 When EPA approved Texas' PSD permitting program, it specifically approved the public notice rules, 
stating ""the public participation requirements of the Federal PSD regulations are met by the existing SIP- 
approved section 116.10 of Regulation VI and the PSD Supplement as adopted by the TACB on July 18, 
1987."" 57 Fed. Reg. 28093, 28094 (June 24, 1992). That version of 116.10 did not include a public 
meeting opportunity, although subsection (b)(l) provided that interested persons could submit comments, 
including requests for public hearing pursuant to TCAA 
3.271(c). 
This 1985 amendment, in 8 
116.10(a)(3)(J), was the first time the text of notice included the requirement for availability to request a 
hearing was included in the public notice rule, although contested case (evidentiary) hearings were 
available and held since at least 1978. TACB always considered all permit hearings to be evidentiary 
hearings under the Texas Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Tex. Gov't Code Chapter 2001, and its 
predecessor statute, the Texas Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (APTRA), Tex. Rev. Civ. 
Stat. Ann. Art. 6252-13a. TACB procedural rules going back to 1976, including the last version revised in 
1987 [31 Tex. Admin. Code 5 103.1 1(3)] stated that notice of a permit hearing must be given as required 
by the TCAA and APTRA. Both the APTRA and the APA required notice of hearing, if a hearing was 
called. Note also that both the TCAA and APTRA were approved as statutes in the Texas SIP at 40 CFR 
52.2270. In addition, the TACB adopted rules regarding hearings procedures, as the TCEQ now has in 
Chapter 80.

chief executives of the city and county where the source would be located and any 
state or federal Land Manager or Indian Governing Body whose lands may be 
affected by emissions fiom the source, as required by 40 CFR 5 1.166(q)(iv) and 8 
165(a)(2) of the FCAA. 
TCEQ acknowledges that the rules need to be amended to ensure that all federal and state 
requirements to notify certain persons and entities are included in the rules. 
(d) 
For a new or modified source subject to PSD, the rules do not require the response 
to comments be available prior to final action on the PSD permit, as required by 
40 CFR 5 1.166(q)(vi) and (viii) and § 165(a)(2) of the FCAA. 
TCEQ understands, that by preparing a written response to comments that is provided to 
all interested persons, that this requirement is met in TCEQ rule,""5 although clarification 
to be sure it is fully understood may be necessary. When an RTC is required, the TCEQ 
provides the RTC prior to or at the time of final action on all PSD permit actions."" 40 
CFR 51.161 requires that the comments be made available for public inspection. 
Although there is no specific federal requirement to provide a response to comments, 
there is limited value to accepting comments without a corresponding review of and 
response to comments; TCEQ assumes, therefore, that EPA interprets and implements its 
rules in this manner.37 However, there is no specific deadline for EPA, or any agency 
implementing the PSD permitting program, to provide a response to comments prior to 
permit issuance. Therefore, with the addition to the rules in 1999 of the specific 
requirement to prepare a written response (commonly referred to as an RTC) to all 
commenters, TCEQ meets, and exceeds the language of the federal rules. The RTC is 
mailed to all commenters and interested persons on the mailing lists for applications. For 
permits issued by the Executive Director (which, by rule are uncontested), the RTC is 
mailed with notice of permit issuance. For permits issued by the commission (which 
concern contested applications), the RTC is provided prior to commission consideration 
of the requests for contested case hearing. 
(e) 
There is no definition of ""final appealable decision"" for a PSD permit. 
Although a State must include in its PSD permitting program authority for a challenge in 
state courts of permits issued by the agency, the TCEQ is unaware of any federal 
requirement for a definition of ""final appealable decision,"" and no citation is provided in 
the Notice. 
Additionally, the TCEQ can find no requirement that state permitting 
programs provide legal advice or other direction for persons who wish to challenge the 
issuance of a new or amended PSD permit. Texas statutes provide an opportunity to 
challenge PSD permits issued by the TCEQ. For uncontested permits (those for which no 
requests for contested case hearing is received), persons who commented on the 
35 4 55.156(c). In addition to this distribution of comments, the TCEQ's website for its Office of Chief 
Clerk provides the date that an RTC is filed, and anyone who has not received a copy can request one. 
36 4 55.156. 
37 Certain earlier versions of the Texas public notice rules mirrored the federal rules as to notification to 
applicant of the decision on the permit application. Later, the rule added the requirement that commenters 
be notified of the decision, but did not specifically require a written RTC be prepared and mailed to 
commenters. See 4 116.137.

application are provided a copy of the RTC together with a letter fiom TCEQ explaining 
that a Motion to Overturn (MTO) can be filed for the commission's consideration, and 
stating an appeal may be filed in state district court in Travis County,   ex as.)^ For 
contested permits, i.e., those for which a contested case hearing is requested and the 
permits are subsequently issued by the commission either after denial of all hearing 
requests or after a contested case hearing, the appropriate persons are notified that a 
Motion for Rehearing (MFR) of the commission's action can be filed.39 
A person must comply with the requirement to exhaust the available administrative 
remedies prior to filing suit in district court. As noted above, the TCEQ has provided the 
EPA with the citations for its authority to administer the SIP-approved program and to 
adopt the necessary rules. For the issue of access to judicial review in particular, see 
TCAA, Tex. Health & Safety Code $$ 382.032 and 382.056(n). In addition, EPA has 
approved the Texas Title V Operating Permit Program, which required the submission of 
a Texas Attorney General opinion regarding sufficient access to courts, in compliance 
with Article I11 of the United States Constitution. The Attorney General Opinion 
specifically states that ""[alny provisions of State law that limit access to judicial review 
do not exceed the corresponding limits on judicial review imposed by the standing 
requirement of Article I11 of the United States Constitution."" The state statutory authority 
cited in support of the Texas Title V Operating Program includes TCAA $ 382.032, 
which is the basic support for the Texas PSD permitting program, as well. 
The 
provisions of TCAA $ 382.056(n) complement the authority in TCAA $ 382.032, and 
prescribe the provisions for administrative review, not judicial review, of commission 
actions. Therefore, the Texas Attorney General statement regarding equivalence of 
judicial review based on TCAA $ 382.032 in accord with Article I11 of the United States 
Constitution is also applicable for every action of the commission subject to the TCAA, 
including PSD permit decisions. 
3. Section 1V.C. Regarding PAL Applications 
EPA also raises three issues regarding notice of Plantwide Applicability Limits (PAL) 
applications. First, there is no provision that PALs be established, renewed or increased 
through a procedure that is consistent with 40 CFR 5 1.160 and 5 1.161, including the 
requirement that the state provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a 
PAL permit and at least a 30-day period for submittal of public comment, consistent with 
certain Federal PAL rules. Second, there is no requirement that the State address all 
material comments before taking final action 'on a PAL for existing major stationary 
sources. Finally, the applicability in $ 39.403 does not include PALS, despite a cross- 
reference to Chapter 39 in $ 1 16.194. 
The TCEQ acknowledges that the rules in Chapter 39 should be amended to provide 
clarification as to the precise requirements for notice of PALs; Chapter 39 was not open 
for revision at the time the PAL rules were adopted by the commission in January 2006. 
However, in practice, the agency generally requires applicants for PALs to comply with 
38 
See Attachment 1, which is an example of a form letter sent to commenters regarding issuance of 
uncontested air permit. Similar language is included in other form letters to commenters for other types of 
uncontested air permit actions. 
39 The MTO and MFR process also applies to minor NSR permits that are subject to notice. 

Comments by Texas Commission on Environmental Qualiry 
EPA Docket ID No. EPA-R06-OAR-2007-0209 
Page 11 of 18 
the notice requirements for PSD permits, with the exception that there is no opportunity 
for a contested case hearing or request for reconsideration. PALS are subject to a notice 
and comment hearing. This includes notice of intent to obtain a PAL in the notice of 
application (if known). Notice of the draft PAL permit is required for initial issuance, all 
amendments and renewals. Also, an RTC is prepared to respond to any timely comments 
received on the PAL application or draft PAL permit. 
4. Section 1V.D. Regarding Flexible Permit Applications 
EPA raised two issues regarding notice of a flexible permit. 
(a) 
The rules do not require a 30-day notice and comment opportunity on the draft 
permit and air quality analysis for the initial issuance of a flexible permit to 
establish a minor NSR applicability cap or an increase in a flexible permit cap as 
required by 40 CFR 5 1.16 1. 
TCEQ agrees with EPA's understanding of the rules. However, in practice, the TCEQ 
requires compliance with the first (Notice of Receipt of Application and Intent to to 
Obtain Permit, or NORI) and second (NAPD) notice requirements in $5 39.418 and 
39.41 9 as would be required for any other minor or major source permit application. The 
rules need to be amended to reflect the actual practice. 
(b) 
The rules do not require public participation consistent with 40 CFR 5 1.16 1 and 
5 1.166(q) where PSD and non-attainment NSR terms and conditions are modified 
or eliminated when the permit is incorporated into a flexible permit. 
Changes in PSD and non-attainment NSR permit terms and conditions for flexible 
permits are, in practice, subject to the same notice requirements as changes in these for 
other minor or major source permits. The rules need to be amended to reflect the actual 
practice. 
B. Response to Analysis of whether Texas Minor NSR Public Participation Rules 
meet federal requirements for approval in Section V.A. 
1. With regard to EPA's summary of the regulatory requirements4' of the Notice, TCEQ 
is unaware of any federal rule, for which States had opportunity for notice and comment, 
that requires public notice for applications that involve limiting potential to emit (PTE) 
for synthetic minors or when netting is used to avoid major NSR review. TCEQ requests 
that EPA provide specific legal citation for this requirement. 
In addition, TCEQ rules do not provide for a blanket exemption from public participation 
for all applications that involve limitations on PTE for synthetic minors or applications 
including netting analysis to avoid major NSR review. The TCEQ rules do provide for 
limited exemptions from public participation in accordance with the discretion provided 
by federal rules as discussed in Section A.1. of this response. Actions exempted from 
public notice may involve some PTE limitations andlor some applications with netting to 
avoid major IVSR.

2. EPA's conclusion that the requirement to request a contested case hearing to obtain 
the State's air quality analysis does not provide the public with the minimum public 
information required by 40 CFR 5 1.161 (a) and (b). 
In addition to TCEQ's. response above regarding Section 1V.A. of the Notice, TCEQ 
disagrees that the rules do not provide the public with the minimum required information. 
The added requirement to request a contested case hearing, which is not prohibited by 
federal rule, actually has two benefits. First, the public is provided the opportunity for a 
longer public notice period. EPA rules do not provide for notice of the application, and 
therefore provide only a 30-day notice of draft permit with an opportunity for a notice 
and comment hearing; this gives the public a very short window of time to become 
familiar with the application and a draft permit. By contrast, Texas' system provides 
notice early in the process, and requires nothing more within the first 30 days than to 
simply make a written request for a contested case hearing.41 That simple act is hardly 
burdensome, and is a limitation only on minor NSR applications, not PSD or non- 
attainment permit applications.42 While the application is under technical review, the 
public has the opportunity to study the application, prepare comments before or after the 
draft permit is available for public review, and determine whether to submit the 
comments andlor additional reasons for why they should be granted a contested case 
hearing. Diligence on the part of the public, under Texas minor source rules or EPA 
rules, is necessary during a 30 day period, and is not an overly burdensome or 
unreasonable requirement. 
Second, requirement reduces the administrative burden for processing notices. Although 
there is fluctuation in actual numbers from year to year, the agency has seen a fairly 
consistent percentage of applications that receive requests for contested case hearings 
over the years, regardless of whether the application involves a PSD permit application 
for which a timely request can be received later in the process, both prior to and since the 
passage of HB 801. The percentage of contested matters is less than 5% of the 
applications required to comply with the public notice requirements in Chapter 39; TCEQ 
has approximately 14,000 NSR permits, and processes several thousand permit actions 
yearly. To require notice of this information would require that all of the applications be 
subject to notice required by §§ 39.41 9 and 39.603(b), not just those that receive hearing 
requests, or are PSD or non-attainment NSR applications. 
Finally, although HI3 80 1 and the corresponding rules provided more structure as to when 
notice of application must be provided, the opportunity to request a contested case 
hearing has not changed since approval of the public participation rules into the  SIP.^^ 
TCEQ is unsure whether EPA fully understands the process for requesting a contested 
case hearing and how that is linked to the opportunity to provide comments on the draft 
permit and air quality analysis for minor NSR permit applications. Although § 55.201(b) 
4 1 See more discussion about requesting a contested case hearing later in this section. 
42 
PSD and nonattainrnent applications are also subject to early (first) notice and requests for contested 
case hearings submitted in response to that notice are considered timely, but those requests are not 
necessary to trigger second notice. 
43 See footnotes 6,34 and 47.

provides a list of who can request a contested case hearing, the rule does not prohibit 
interested persons who are not a member of any of the enumerated persons from filing 
hearing requests. Although not everyone can (or will) be granted a contested case 
hearing, the air quality analysis comment opportunity is available to anyone when the 
notice of draft permit and preliminary decision is published which is triggered by 
timely contested case hearing requests received in response to the first notice (NORI) for 
minor source NSR permit applications. That information is available to any interested 
persons. Neither the commission nor an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at the State 
Ofice of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) makes any determination of affected person, 
nor excludes any interested persons, before the second notice is published. Rather, all 
requests are considered by the commission at the end of the public participation period 
and briefing by the statutory parties and requestors. If a contested case hearing is granted 
by the commission, or the application is directly referred for hearing by the applicant, 
then a SOAH ALJ considers requests by anyone who appears in person stating that they 
are affected persons.44 Therefore, the minimal requirement of anyone merely requesting a 
contested case hearing can result in lengthening the comment period and expanding the 
information on which comments can be submitted, and the public is not unduly or 
unreasonably burdened nor limited to initiate this process. 
The TCEQ's early-in-time system is not too burdensome as compared to EPA's later-in- 
time scheme. The Texas Legislature, in directing the commission to implement this 
process, carefully considered the benefits and costs to the public of early participation 
versus the benefits and costs to later participation under the federal 30-day notice after 
draft permit scheme. This discretion was appropriately handed over to states by EPA in 
its rules, and approval of TCEQ's rules may not be unreasonably withheld by EPA at this 
juncture, or in the future. Therefore, EPA's concerns are unfounded, and TCEQ's rules 
meet the federal requirements. 
3. EPA specifically requested comments on the issue of who shall publish notice (the 
state or the applicant), while acknowledging that the state has the authority to delegate 
that requirement. EPA expressed concern about the timely ability to determine the 
beginning and ending dates of the comment period. 
TCEQ appreciates EPA's acknowledgment that the state has the authority to delegate the 
requirement to publish notice. 
The TCEQ and its predecessor agencies have 
implemented this requirement via delegation since 1978. Further, TCEQ rules include 
44 At page 72010 of the notice, EPA cites to §§ 55.21(b) and 55.23. These rules do not apply to air 
applications submitted after September 1, 1999, nor to any earlier filed applications because these sections 
were not adopted under authority of the TCAA. Rather, for applications subject to the rules implementing 
HB 801, the applicable sections regarding requesting a contested case hearing and request by group or 
association are found in $4 55.201 and 55.205. In addition, although an individual or group must 
demonstrate that they have a justiciable interest in the permit application to obtain status as a party in a 
contested case hearing, that process is after completion of first and second notices, any public meetings, 
and issuance of the Executive Director's RTC. (The RTC may not be available at time a hearing is called 
for applications directly referred to SOAH, but it is prepared as quickly as possible for those minimal 
number of applications.) Lastly, if the commission grants even a single request for a contested case 
hearing, the ALJ has authority to consider additional requests from persons who attend the preliminary 
hearing seeking party status.

requirements to ensure that notice is timely complied with."" The specific requirements to 
comply with all notice requirements and provide satisfactory proof of compliance satisfy, 
and go beyond, federal rules. In addition, while there may be additional ways to make 
information available to the public, such as how the TCEQ's website already includes 
text of notice within a day or so of it being provided to applicants for newspaper 
publication, the TCEQ has not identified any additional procedures that would assist 
persons in being more diligent about looking for newspaper notice and checking the 
TCEQ website. TCEQ finds it ironic that this concern is being raised only recently while 
over the past nine years the TCEQ has expanded the time of notice for some applications 
and made more information available on its website, actually providing to the public 
more (and more timely) information. Comments are timely if received at any time after 
the application is filed with the TCEQ until the close of the comment period, which is 
never less than 30 days fiom date of initial publication. The TCEQ makes every effort to 
include the actual date of the end of the comment period in the web database for 
contested items. And, both EPA and the general public can call the TCEQ with questions 
about the close of the comment period. The bottom line is that the TCEQ's current rules 
meet existing federal requirements, and any infrequent or non-existing delays due to 
mailing are not a reasonable or supportable basis for disapproval of TCEQ's rules. 
C. Response to Section VI. Regarding Other Public Participation 
1. Section V1.A. Regarding Cross References to Rules Not in the SIP. 
TCEQ will need to conduct further review and have further discussion with EPA as to 
how to address this issue. 
2. Section V1.B. Regarding Use of Undefined Acronyms. 
EPA notes that several sections use the acronyms APA, SOAH and WQMP, but are not 
defined in the rules submitted. TCEQ agrees that it appears that the first two are not 
defined in the submitted rules. APA is an acronym for the Texas Administrative 
Procedure Act, located in the Texas Government Code at Chapter 2001, and SOAH, is an 
acronym for the State Office of Administrative Hearings, the state agency that conducts 
the contested case hearings for the TCEQ. This could be clarified in a rule amendment. 
The third acronym is actually spelled out in tj 39.401; WQMP stands for water quality 
management plans. Although no specific rules regarding WQMP are submitted for SIP 
approval, this acronym is used in the applicability rule. 
3. Section V1.C. Regarding Cross Reference to Obsolete Provision for Permits bv Rule 
for Concrete Batch Plants 
TCEQ acknowledges that it has not amended the rules to update the references for 
authorizations for concrete batch plants. 
45 $5 39.405 and 39.605. 
46 TCEQ is generally not including responses to comments on individual rules that will be addressed in a 
later action by TCEQ (such as V1.D.) 

EPA Docket ID NO. EPA-R06-OAR-2007-0209 
Comments by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 
Page 15 of18 
4. Section V1.E. regarding Alternative Publication Procedures for Small Businesses 
TCEQ will need to conduct further review and have further discussion with EPA as to 
how to address this issue. 
5. Section V1.F. Regarding Relaxation of Sign Posting Requirements Under 6 39.604 
First, EPA has acknowledged that the sign posting requirements, in state rule since 1985, 
have no federal counterpart and exceed federal requirements. Both of the issues raised by 
EPA relate to text that is already part of a SIP-approved rule.47 However, further 
discussion may be helpful due to reorganization of the text when it was adopted as new $ 
39.604 in 1999. First, in 1999, the term ""thoroughfare"" was replaced with ""public 
highway, street or road"" in subsection (c). As explained in the TCEQ's proposal for this 
rule change48 and the adoption 
these changes were made to clarify that a sign 
is not required to be posted on a waterway following TCEQ Air Rule Interpretation 
Memo R6-133.001. The memo addresses the issue of what is meant by the undefined 
term ""thoroughfare."" It analyzed Texas law and determined that the term ""thoroughfare"" 
means street or passage through which one can travel, a street or highway affording an 
unobstructed exit at each end into another street or passage. Given this interpretation, 
and the fact that agency staff historically had not considered rivers or any water body a 
public thoroughfare and therefore no applicant had been required to post a sign on the 
shore of a river or water body, the rule was amended. 
Second, the rulemaking added the last sentence to subsection (c) which states ""[tlhis 
section's sign requirements do not apply to properties under the same ownership which 
are noncontiguous or separated by intervening public highway, street, or road, unless 
directly involved by the permit application."" 
The sentence was and is located in 
subsection (e) of § 1 16.133, and was revised to replace the word ""thoroughfare"" and was 
relocated when the new rule was adopted.50 The relocated sentence incorporates and 
compliments this clarification and ensures that the property that is the subject of the 
application has proper signage. TCEQ disagrees that this is a relaxation of the SIP. 
In addition, TCEQ disagrees that the sign posting rule was further relaxed by the 
omission of the SIP-approved $ 116.133(f)(l). The requirement to post signs in an 
alternate language, even if alternate language newspaper notice is waived, remains in the 
rule at § 39.604(e).~' However, it appears that the rule submitted to EPA contained an 
incorrect cross reference ($ 39.703(d)(5)), which has been corrected in a subsequent 
rulemaking. TCEQ will need to conduct further review as to how to address this issue to 
ensure the correct version is submitted to EPA for the SIP. 
D.

Comments by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 
Page 16of 18 
1. Section VILA, regarding rules which implement FCAA 6 112(& 
TCEQ understands that EPA interprets this part of the FCAA to be self-implementing 
and are carried out separately from the SIP, and therefore there is no reason for EPA to 
take action on these items. 
2. Section VILA. regarding rules which do not relate to air aualitv permits or to 
provisions that are not in the approved SIP 
TCEQ will need to conduct further review as to how to address this issue to ensure the 
correct version is submitted to EPA for the SIP. 
3. Section VI1.A. regarding rules in Chapter 55 
EPA is not taking action on certain rules in Chapter 55 that do not have any federal 
counterpart. Although TCEQ has not withdrawn its submission of certain rules in 
Chapter 55 which were included in the 1999 rules, TCEQ agrees that most of these do not 
have any federal counterpart and therefore should not be considered for action by EPA 
until EPA and TCEQ staff can have further discussion. Generally, all or parts of the four 
rules which EPA proposed to grant limited approval and limited disapproval,52 were 
submitted to meet federal requirements. As discussed above, EPA's rules do not 
specifically require a response to public comment, although without such a response, the 
opportunity to submit comments is less effective. Therefore, the TCEQ understood that 
EPA interprets it rules to require a response to comments must be prepared and 
distributed to commenters. As also discussed above, the opportunity to request a public 
meeting which is typically conducted after the draft permit is prepared, together with the 
opportunity to request a contested case hearing satisfies the federal requirement to offer 
the opportunity to request a notice and comment hearing under the federal rules. 
Therefore, TCEQ understand that these rules are needed to meet federal requirements and 
that they also strengthen the SIP, and therefore should be fully approved as a revision to 
the SIP. If EPA's position, after consideration of these comments, is that the rules are not 
needed for the SIP, then TCEQ and EPA can have further discussion as to the next steps 
to take.

Re: Docket ID No. EPA-R06-OAR-2007-0209; The Association of Electric Companies 
~f Texas' comments on Proposed Limited ApprovalILimited Disapproval of Texas' 
Public Participation SIP Revisions, which was iil the November 26, 2008 Federal 
Register (73 Fed. Reg. 72,001-72,016) 
Dear Mr. Spruiell: 
These are the Association of Electric Companies of Texas (""AECT"") comments to 
:he U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (""EPA"") proposed limited approval and 
.imited disapproval of Texas' proposed state implementation plan (""SIP"") revisions 
:elating to public participation requirements for air quality permitting. 
4ECT is a trade association representing electric companies in Texas. Organized in 
1978, AECT provides a forum for member companies' representatives to exchange 
nformation on their industry, and to communicate with state and federal governmental 
~fficials. 
4ECT strongly supports EPA approving all of the Texas SIP revisions relating to public 
~articipation requirements for air quality permitting. 
The public participation 
-equirements in the currently approved Texas SIP are extensive, and, in many ways, 
:xceed federal public participation requirements. 
Since the dates EPA made such 
~pprovals, EPA has not changed the applicable federal requirements governing SIP 
lpproval of public participation requirements. Further, EPA has determined that the 
?reposed public participation SIP ievisions would ""as a whole, strengthen the SIP 
:ompared to the corresponding provisions in the existing [fully approved] SIP"". (73 Fed 
Reg. 72,009). Moreover, AECT believes that the proposed public participation SIP 
:evisions satisfy the applicable legal requirements for EPA to approve all of them, and 
:hat the deficiencies of the proposed SIP revisions that EPA has identified are not 
supportable (as is addressed in detail by the comment letter filed by the Texas Industry 
Project). In light of the foregoing, EPA should approve all of the proposed public 
~articipation SIP revisions. EPA's proposed limited disapproval of the proposed SIP 
.evisions is arbitrary and would create a disincentive for states to adopt rules that would, 
.ike the public participation rules in the proposed SIP revisions, improve existing, 
~pproved SIP requirements. 

AECT also strongly objects to EPA calling for Texas to make additional changes to its 
already approved public participation SIP requirements in order to avoid facing sanctions. 
There is no basis for such sanctions since, as discussed above, the proposed public 
participation SIP revisions are approvable and should be approved. It would be arbitrary 
for EPA to take an action that would trigger a sanctions clock when the public 
participation d e s  of the Texas SIP have already been fully approved by EPA, and the 
proposed public participation SIP revisions would only strengthen the existing public 
participation requirements in the Texas SIP. 
AECT appreciates the opporhmity to submit these comments.

Attention Docket ID No. EPA-R05-OAR-2007- 1 100 
Dear Mr. Mooney: 
The following are comments of the Regional Air Pollution Control Agency (RAPCA) of 
Dayton, Ohio on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Proposed Rule to approve 
the Ohio State Implementation plan to allow the state to discontinue the vehicle inspection and 
maintenance (IIM) program in the Dayton-Springfield Area. This proposal was published in the 
Federal Register on July 14,2008 (73 Federal Register 43 180). RAPCA is a six-county local air 
pollution control agency serving the citizens of the Southwest Ohio counties of Clark, Darke, 
Greene, Miami, Montgomery, and Preble. 
RAPCA was fully supportive of the I/M program which operated in our area for ten years. We 
feel that in that 10-year period the program was effective in helping to reduce air pollution to 
levels sufficient to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone (both the former 1- 
hr standard and the 1997 8-hr standard). The Dayton-Springfield Area was redesignated 
attainment for the 1 -hr standard in 1995 and the 8-hr standard in 2007. When the Ohio 
Legislature rescinded the IIM program for the Dayton-Springfield Area, they did so contrary to 
our technical recommendation. However, Ohio EPA identified additional reductions and 
adopted rules to secure those reductions in a timely manner. We feel that especially the low 
volatility gasoline requirement is sufficient to provide emissions reductions equivalent to those 
which would have occurred should the I/M program have continued. Therefore, we support this 
proposal to move the I/M program requirements to the contingency measures portion of the 
Dayton-Springfield ozone maintenance plan. 
RAPCA personnel are fully aware that new issues are in play which may affect our ability to 
meet EPA's newest standards for ozone and PM2.5. The recent court vacature of EPA's Clean 
Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) is significant, but the solution to this problem involves the adoption 
of new rules to control emissions from electric generating units (EGUs), not the re-establishment 

of a vehicle emissions control program. We will work closely with Ohio EPA, USEPA, and our 
National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) on solutions. 
Thank you for this opportunity to comment. Please contact this writer with any questions or 
concerns.

Attention: 
Docket No. EPA-RO5-OAR-2007-1044; Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality 
Implementation Plans; Zllinois and Indiana; Finding of Attainment for I-Hour 
Ozone for the Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-INArea 
Dear Mr. Mooney: 
On July 7,2008, the U.S. EPA proposed to issue a finding of attainment for the 1-hour 
ozone standard for the Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-IN Area. This is an important matter to the . 
state of Indiana, and this letter outlines the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's 
(IDEM) comments to the docket in reference to this proposed action. 
First, I wish to express IDEM'S support of the U.S. EPA's proposal to issue a finding of 
attainment. Additionally, LDEM is very pleased with and supports the U.S. EPA's proposed 
determination that the area not be subject to the imposition of section 185 penalty fees. 
With that said, IDEM encourages the U.S. EPA to give further consideration to and 
provide guidance regarding the appropriate New Source Review thresholds applicable to the 
Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-IN Area. Per the State of Indiana's request for a clean datdfinding 
of attainment, our portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-IN AT:?. !I::: :E: :i. l ~f~.~iqations 
under the I-hour ozone standard. Furthermore, per the U.S. 
EPA's ~rj;c-'.;c:.; ;"": ':YI!.-.:;

revoked on June 15,2005. The area was designated moderate non-attainment under the 8-hour 
ozone standard effective June 15,2004, one year prior to the I-hour ozone standard being revoked. 
Although the area was clearly eligible for redesignation under the 1-hour standard, the area could 
not have been redesignated to attainment prior to the 1-hour standard being revoked.

As you know, the implementation rule for the 8-hour ozone standard clearly indicated that 
attainment redesignation under the 1-hour standard was not necessary because the classifications 
under the 8-hour ozone standard superseded all 1-hour classifications once the 1-hour ozone 
standard was revoked on June 15,2005. Accordingly, the implementation rule concluded that the 
8-hour designations alone would govern the applicability of New Source Review to areas. 
However, this portion of the implementation rule was later determined to constitute backsliding 
for areas thai failed to meet obligations under the 1-hour ozone standard prior to it being revoked, 
and, as noted in the proposed finding of attainment, the U.S. EPA is developing a separate NSR 
policy to address these areas. 
Importantly, the Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-IN Area, which had met all obligations, 
including monitored compliance, prior to revocation of the 1-hour ozone standard, is not such an 
area. Therefore, the State of Indiana strongly feels that the New Source Review provisions for the 
Chicago-Gary-Lake County, LL-IN Area should be based solely on the area's classification under 
the 8-hour ozone standard. IDEM encourages the U.S. EPA to address this matter with greater 
specificity within its final action concerning the proposed finding of attainment. 
Indiana respectfully submits these comments and asks that they be considered prior to 
finalizing this proposed finding. Should you have any questions regarding these comments, please 
contact. me at (31.7) 232-8222 or by email at dmurrav@idem.in.aov.
